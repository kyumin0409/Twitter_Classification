@V_actually @BarackObama 👉 Didn’t this clown veto the keystone pipeline and drilling oil in Alaska? He also shut down other land sites from drilling oil! My only advice is for Obama to put the crack pipe down and move back to Kenya!👌
@tomselliott So he blocks additional oil leases and expanded drilling his ENTIRE two terms,,,and then claims credit for increased oil production. Interesting. Apparently ex Presidents can access REALLY GOOD DRUGS.🤣🤣🤣

Oil leader puts Obama in his place over oil production. Trump cut 600 Obama regulations and opened up for drilling. Its 100% @POTUS that did it. 👍
@theblaze 😂😂😂😂 keystone block, national land blocked 4 oil drilling...blocked new oil offshore drilling, fed regs on oil refineries all with hands up. Next he will want credit for helping the coal mines. Lying is truth to BO and truth is a lie &amp; four died in Benghazi due to a video.🤥
