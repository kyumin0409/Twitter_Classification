Most of y’all don’t know what it feel like to be another mans pawn in his attempt for an assisted suicide with the cops... 🤐
@DIYolie what they use for physician assisted suicide 😂
Oh, goodie!! I'm gonna go get an abortion and have assisted suicide when I get sick since the U.N. says it's ok🙃🙃🙃
Quality of life is better than quantity. ❤️❤️
@smokezwinger This sounds a lot like assisted suicide to me😂😂I'm taking that bullet like a man bro😅
Explain that one! Please! 😄
Why in class must we be seeing this video of death and assisted suicide, what is this why is this, 🙂
A successful night of liver assisted suicide 🙂
@ImprobableJoe 😂 🤣 😂 🤣  I'm gonna die with some dignity. I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of suffering. Gotta get to a state or country that allows assisted suicide.
@Ancientengineer @lambdawon @neverbecoming @AlfonzCavalier @ElvenArchangel @catholicEW Yeah it is. Suicide is also a sin, or did you miss that? And physician assisted suicide is being pushed for. 🙄
Didn't even get jumped, just a bit of assisted suicide 😭
@megem I just lost my almost 101 year old Mom this week. As I watched her deteriorate from active and independent at age 99 to frail and unable to do for herself, I kept thinking that I want Medical-assisted suicide when it’s my turn. 😢
@BernieUpstateNY Do sorry for his/your suffering Assisted suicide resolves many issues- Stay strong! 😔
Great way to start my Thursday. Talking about poverty and Physician Assisted Suicide😭😭
@troxeltrevor I don’t know right now what genes can be edited. I haven’t read that much but it is pretty interesting and scary and hopeful thing to learn about. It’s one of those things you hope will be patient decision. But probably won’t be 😬. Like assisted suicide
@wayvydon You're right, this was just a cleverly framed plea for a helper for my assisted suicide ☹️
California assisted suicide law remains in legal limbo 👇 Assisted suicide should remain or return to being illegal everywhere!! 🙏🇺🇸🌎🙏 #ProLife #MAGA  https://t.co/ncPhRkCxkH
This video is just fucking 👌. He’s cringeworthy to the point of his videos basically being assisted suicide.
@nursekelsey Assisted suicide is legal here in Colorado, but finding a doctor to participate is difficult. I wish we could do it in the hospital 😔

@Nataliew1020 you are an angel and so is your daughter.  You have millions of people praying for you and Sophia.🙏🏻🙏🏻
#LouisTheroux #AlteredStates brilliant new series, assisted suicide episode wow 😪
@KatrinaPierson @Twitter @SecretService Under Fire ? She needs to be arrested and prosecuted! This has all gone Way Too Far!!! Conservatives don’t threaten to murder people, but that’s obvious because We also don’t believe in Abortions!!! Or assisted suicide!!! Stop the hatred!! 🙏🏻💖🇺🇸
@RubyMcrae @siano2020 But you're only 68. I'm all for assisted suicide in case of terminal suffering, but I want to linger as long as possible 😉

@Janet93381236 @ThomasKlineMD On Facebook there's a few large groups, one called C.O.R.E. and they were literally talking about finding Drs to help with assisted suicide 💔

@siano2020 Yes bc it’s not assisted suicide. It’s humane euthanasia 💜
