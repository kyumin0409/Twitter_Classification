I called Planned Parenthood earlier to make an appt to switch out my birth control .. I’ve been having the Nexplanon the past 6 years, getting it switched out every 3. Why tf today, this lady tells me I can keep it in kuz this shit can really last up to FOUR years.... 😶😐😶😐
@TarekFatah Sharia law - parents can't be charged for killing their children is somewhat similar to the Planned Parenthood killing babies. But the Western morality crusaders hardly see the similarities.🙄

@_MoCowBell_ Pssst, nobody tell them that NARAL, Planned Parenthood, Open Society Foundation, CAIR, etc are all special interest groups too. 😂
MUST STOP giving TaxPyrFunds 2PP‼️😡‼️
@Godsteethethel @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Stop talking about Planned Parenthood that way. Remember, they do wonderful work there.😖
@solarblush Looks to be another successful prototype. Way better then planned parenthood 😂
@chuckhoward50 @robert4spfld @jsavite @LiveAction Insults, really? 🤦 Planned Parenthood was created to kill off "inferior" races. Today, they still operate in predominately minority neighborhoods. It's more about what is pushed on women, the idea that they can't afford a baby, get ahead, etc.
Overall U.S. abortion ⬇️
@DrLeanaWen More preventable deaths 😞https://t.co/b1GYRTGkxk
