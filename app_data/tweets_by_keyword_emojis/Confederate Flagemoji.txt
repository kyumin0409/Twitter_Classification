How is it 2018 and people are still claiming the confederate flag isn’t racist? Have y’all ever opened a book? One simple fucking google search will tell you what that flag stood for and why it’s racist/hateful. 🙄🙄🙄🙄Thank you, next.
@dadijjin @GretchenLynn48 Yeah I photoshopped your comments and all the confederate flag gifs too huh 🙄 #NiceTryTho
Next time she’ll come dressed up in KKK hood and a torch... gurl bye 🙄 https://t.co/hHM2ETwLrq
@Russian_Starr Who would thought Medgar Evers brother would vote 🗳 for the confederate flag. I’m glad I’m not related.
@wvjoe911 @lifieldgg @espyforsenate I knew that would happen. I didn’t get emotionally involved in this one because Mississippi is a HOT MESS and always will be. They use the confederate image as part of their state flag for chrissakes. 🤦‍♀️
The worst people in the world are the ones who slap a confederate flag sticker on their suped up F-150 and do donuts in the parking lot 💀💀💀
a racist winning in the the state that has part of the confederate flag in its state flag and y’all really out here surprised 🤣
My guy was on FB live smashing a red head with confederate flag on her back lmao !!! I’m so dead rn 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@AllCharisma I checked out their state flag @AllCharisma haha. How could you be surprised about the result when their flag is a mix of the confederate and Russian 😱☘
@wayndette1 @bluelivesmtr Lining school walls with propaganda doesn't matter? I bet you'd feel differently if you saw school walls lined with posters of the confederate flag. And I bet inviting the black panthers in to speak would justify it bc it's exposure to the other side. 😏
@mikaOnPoint @Yung_Grim @HashtagthisOk @AaGibbs_KU @Krm1285A @GenFlynn I've been called trailer trash waving my confederate flag... I live in Massachusetts 🤣🤣 https://t.co/LxXXGaEkGQ
They don't like it when I remind them that's the loser's flag. 😋
Ye’s Aunty 😂 RT @CNN: She wore a Confederate flag to vote, then she laid it on a civil rights leader's grave.
Got the Confederate flag and everything. Lawd! 😩 #BlackLightning
@ThomasJBunn @225Kristen @SowellDaily @HappyManor I see Americans who advocate the right to own machine guns as potential killers 😊 Not necessarily Trump-supporting, Confederate flag-waving, KKK, teeth-knashing, etc. Just mostly that type 😊 And, pushed to the edge, definitely killers. That's why I wouldn't let you own a gun 😊
I see all these parents getting their kids Confederate flag to walk around the crazy water with 😷😷😷😷
@espyforsenate Not gonna lie, Mike... I thought you did pretty well for a state that still has the confederate flag on their state flag. 🤦‍♂️

@callstevejoyce @Kolesnikoff Fantastic point. 🙄  Now do the Confederate flag.
If I see any of u motherfuckers with a Mexico flag it’s done!! only US &amp; Confederate Flags over here bud 👿
Racism is alive and well in Princess anne 😂😂 this red neck just had the whole confederate flag painted on the back of his truck.
People are so dumb. Moms trying to sell my bed and I have a confederate flag blanket on it and people were asking if it came with white sheets and burning torches too🙄 damn liberals getting all butt hurt over a blanket🙄
🚨BREAKING🚨 State that voted this century to keep the confederate flag in its state flag votes to send racist to US Senate #MSSen
@TheView why not keep the Confederate flag up?! It's an everyday re-minder of the U.S. History.😂 #HappySunCycleEra😎 #TheView
When people ask me why do I have a BETO sticker still on my car when he lost, I respond with “IDK, why do people still wave the Confederate flag even though they lost like 150 years ago 🤷🏻‍♂️ #clapback 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@FedUpSouthPaw @nesteggPUB @jaketapper The red x is the latest configuration of the Confederate flag and is used widely by white nationalists and Trump supporters who have fantasies about Bill Clinton they can't back up.  😁
@HensleeDawn @vivian_terry @JromeroRaymond @Alina__IV We vote tomorrow - Hyde-Smith will win. MS is dead last in EVERYTHING yet they support racists and bigots. Next door hangs a confederate flag, cars sport Trump/Pence bumper stickers + Women-4-Trump. I leave my house when Trump supporting housekeeper is here! I HATE DJT 😡
@kylegriffin1 Bigotry, segregation, voter suppression,confederate flag flying from the capitol: today's Mississippi. MAny of us had hoped MS had evolved. Guess we were wrong 😪

Shocking that Mississippi would live up to its racist reputation; I mean, it’s not like the confederate flag is part of the state flag or anything 🙄 https://t.co/5H1PIU3xn1
@Smooth_Toasted @JohnnyBeeDawg @MilesAndMilesO3 @bennyjohnson @MeerkatYitz @Acosta @CNN @realDonaldTrump Which is clearly why you seem to be under the misguided belief that the Confederate Flag is from another country that you also believe was/is “invading” ours....😑🤦🏼‍♀️ I hope you and your “fellow countrymen” have a nice day.

@eloisemlr That’s true. Living in NYC is distinct from living in the US. While I was in Minnesota for thanksgiving and my dad &amp; I did a grocery store run in a more rural town we usually don’t go to...and we saw someone proudly flying a confederate flag in their front yard. 😶

@PBandJenelley_1 First of all, he never apologized, he still stands by what he said til this day. Second of all, he’s fucking flying the confederate flag around trying to claim he’s not racist, when we all know what the shit stand for. Next😒 https://t.co/xJgvoaKtL4

She brought the noose to symbolize the past lynching of her ancestors. The flag was to represent the heavy burden of racism that still exists on her shoulders. “It still weighs me down," Bivins said. "The flag represents racism, slavery &amp; affliction." ✌🏽 https://t.co/WR6CQHKRV0
