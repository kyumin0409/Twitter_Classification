@pinkk9lover @POTUS @MattalianoGuy @ROCKONOHIO @BestBrownsFan @AppSame @PinkBelgium @starcrosswolf @Jamierodr10 @RealMAGASteve @AnnaApp91838450 @LVNancy People say capital punishment is not a deterrent. It certainly cuts the recidivism rate. People rarely commit crimes of any sort once they have been executed.😀

@SayShady @dakinehapa808 @KTHopkins Not even remotely missing the point, my friend 😁. “All the men and women whom I have faced at that final moment convince me that in what I have done I have not prevented a single murder.”  Pierrepoint’s views on capital punishment btw.

@GlobalCalgary @NancyHixt I remember when this happened, it was so heartbreaking; is so heartbreaking. 💔 See this guy is why we need to reinstate Capital Punishment, in my opinion. Because you know, fingerprint on the duct tape is pretty much guilty to me. Didn't they have CCTV of him taking the child?

@metpoliceuk @shahjhan_malikk @MetCC If it happens in Dubai the police will catch the thief within hours and will amputate his hands in public after swift trial. Britain needs capital punishment against the violent thugs 🙏🙏🙏

@Shahzir11 @will_mcco @cnnbrk Everyone knows the level of torture Pakistan does &amp; how it doesn't give a damn about human rights.There is reason why your country gives capital punishment to it's civilians(sometimes in military court😨) in such a high number probably only behind nations like Saudi Arabia&amp;China.
