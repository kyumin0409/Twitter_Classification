Don’t be ignorant to the truth. You can only defend “science” for so long until the pure hard evidence is presented. The FDA/CDC refuses to document reported any fatalities due to vaccines because of payout/money loss. Keep going, idiots, keep up your population control. 😂🙄🤦🏻‍♀️

@espiers To be clear, I wasn't arguing that vaccines should be banned, just that they shouldn't be mandatory. My fear is that the standards for which ones are mandatory could slip as politicians aren't always well researched on the legislation they vote for. Anyway, you made me think. 👍

Because y’all decided to listen Sarah Anne about how she thought vaccines made kids have Down syndrome 😐 Now look, some shit we had figured tf out is up and running.
Please don’t disregard the importance of having the different vaccines especially the MMR vaccine. Don’t disregard the simple rash you see 😊
Negative of the day: having to listen to an interview about vaccines because people don’t vaccinate their kids 😒
@Mightywell1886 @ICanStayHealthy I figure it’s to pressure people into poisoning their children. They all know how dangerous vaccines are but they won’t admit it. It’s all about money. I believe a real boycott of them would change their stance. But will people boycott? Not unless their TV tells them to. 🤦🏻‍♀️
