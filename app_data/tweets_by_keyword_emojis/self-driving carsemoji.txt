Today on my driving lesson, someone a good four or five cars behind beeped and my first reaction was "oh no what am I doing wrong" until my mum explained that not every beep is aimed at me 😂 maybe it's my self esteem always getting the best of me
Self-driving cars will be a reality ten years from now. 😲 The wireless infrastructure will make this once farfetched concept a reality.
@SoulWireless No worries mate self driving cars coming 2020 😃

3wheeler is unsafe for road and self. 🤦‍♂️ technology and infrastructure is one side. 1st priority is road lane discipline and driving awareness. High end cars with mad drivers will not go on road , may be footpath😡 just an example https://t.co/otzPCrSDPm
@libertygal72 Self driving cars are an issue 🙄
Woah! Wait, wow! China ain't kidding around with their technology! Self-driving cars, a humanoid robot, some camera with FIVE LENSES 😲and a HoloLens? I mean. Why are we still stuck in our old, lanky electronic gadgets? We should have these now! https://t.co/CVQ5IVDI6b

With the rise of self driving cars, there will eventually be a country song about how your truck left you too. 😹
@Orphanedat60 @CNN Really because they already have self driving cars out there so unless you think you won’t make it 10 yrs or so when there more commonplace than your right 😶
@richard80504751 Self driving cars are right down there with spy boxes companies are wrapping up in cutsie little bows getting into everyones houses. Not in my house! 😠
@Sugarsteroni I suspect it’s more about the simplicity of the idea itself.  For example, the market for “self-driving cars” is still early, but the idea is 💯 (assuming you could actually build one)

@RantyAmyCurtis @TonyLimaPOL This is a major reason why I'm against "self-driving" cars. The other reason is not wanting to be run over by a car. 🚗😬

The reason we have traffic jams is because humans are driving. If the cars are self-driven, they will be able to travel at much higher speeds &amp; stay closer together - while decreasing, if not completely eliminating collisions 😏
