@SenatorTomUdall @SenateTweet Maybe you should have thought of that before allowing the illegal Dakota access pipeline under our water! The Missouri River provides a lot of drinking water for people downstream! Your going to be pretty disappointed with the outcome! Water is life! Greed=death! 🤦‍♂️🤛🏽🌎 #Nokxl
@NicolaCJeffery @darrenmark69 @SocialistChris Yes, once again I concur with everything you state and it probably won't be long before among the other labels you mention, daresay, the 'T' word will be right up there with them soon! This is what happened with the Protesters against the Dakota Access Pipeline! Vive La France!😁

Now's also a good time to remember they put many Water Protectors in cages as well. 🙃
