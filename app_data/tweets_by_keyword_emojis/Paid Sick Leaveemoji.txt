Payroll at work have mistakenly paid me three weeks salary when on sick leave. None of the figures add up, didn't clock in or do a time sheet for three weeks. So how fuck does that shit happen! Want it paid back now of course, I'm desk banging and having a row tomorrow!!! 😤😡👊

Grrr. I applied for half a day's sick leave for my doctors appointments last week, and instead of paying me for it (I qualified for paid sick leave in September) my employer has deducted 4 hours pay and has left me seriously short for paying 2 large bills due this week.😠
🤧Unmanageable workloads are among the reasons that employees—even if they have paid sick leave—show up at work when plagued with the flu. Got the flu? Don’t be a Superhero―stay home! Employers, even on #BlackFriday, consider the #wellness of your workers! https://t.co/JCmE5KaYcL https://t.co/nbrD0oonBh
