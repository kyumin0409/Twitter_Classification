@CCSMedical why is it so difficult for supply companies to accept State Medicaid?  Wish it didn't have to come down to the ole mighty dollar bill.😞

@OutlawCasey1 @gbartleman @DMRegister Actually, I pay nothing. I’m a single mother of 2 and live with family. Instead of working, I receive SSI, SSDI, and food stamps. My kids and I are on Medicaid. You pay much more than me and my children do since I pay nothing. 😂😂😂

@sfpelosi @TeamPelosi They risked everything to save lives with ACA.  I'd love to know exactly how many, but you know it's a lot.

Do strippers have health insurance? They have to pay taxes, like everyone else, right? &amp; if so, does that mean they can qualify for Medicaid? Or do they make too much money technically? Or not because it’s tips? I’m sure it differs per club. I need answers. 😭😂

I wish I had my disability approved. It's gonna cost $400, to do a root canal on my front tooth...and Medicaid doesn't cover that. And I can't help that my front teeth broke when I was 8 years old. I'm gonna have to ask my mom and roommate and see if they can help get it fixed.😒
