🚨 NYers: speak with a qualified immigration attorney if you have or had DACA to learn more about your options, such as renewal. For free &amp; safe legal help, call 311 and say “ActionNYC.” https://t.co/yeBtbHyo4P

@LouDobbs In Landmark ruling, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar, just made #DACA Illegal! Judge unwittingly just ended DACA!😂😂😂
Federal judge blocks Trump's new asylum rules: 'He may not rewrite the immigration laws' Like Obama Did?🤔🙄🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/KHcdHmpMxv via @usatoday
@chuteo2006 @MSNBC Just because there is a majority doesn’t always make things happen. What about immigration, you want a wall , Dems want Daca , he proposed a path for 3 times what Obama wanted plus funding for the wall. You have your mind made up ✌️

He passed DACA via EO.  @GOP has blocked all immigration reform legislation talks even w/ Trump.

@chrisfaz525 @CNN Please read the https://t.co/OjNvLXhXZ0 site. HE HAS NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AND ITS THE REASON OBAMA CREATED DACA!!!!! With no pathway you cannot apply, hence the term broken immigration system. He's a Rhodes scholar do you think he doesn't know how to fill out an application? 🤦🏽‍♀️
RT @CoImmAdvocates: Awesome feeling 😀
@charliekirk11 No DACA, Pause all Immigration or we lose the country&lt;&lt;its that simple🚨🚨🚨🚨
😨Those who don't respect our laws and the legal process of immigration, should not become citizens.
@realDonaldTrump  Mr. President. If they don’t give you the five billion now for the wall. Take half plus get rid of all the bad immigration laws . Then when the Daca law by Obama falls through. Then get the rest of your money. The cards will be in your hands. 👍
@Pinkgelato15 @realDonaldTrump That’s BS, he’s just cleaning up the mess the last 3 administration created. The days of open borders, unvetted immigration and unconstitutional DACA are over😉 #BuildTheWall #DealWithIt
Well said @joseiswriting 👏
Tell us @FAIRImmigration are you going to recommend vaste added resources needed to catch up with unbelievable backlog  of asylum requests?  Are you going to support DACA?  I think not given you are a propaganda machine hoping to stop all immigration.⬇️ https://t.co/77M0iGUyaQ

@realDonaldTrump Deny asylum! Phyco liberal  judge said we can't re write immigration laws because Senate didn't approve it? 😂Isn't that EXACTLY what Obama did with daca?? Senate didn't approve daca! Screw these hypocrite liberal judges!Keep that freaking caravan full of felons out!Deny asylum!
@MaxBoot You also changed your mind on immigration, DACA, abortion, and now nobody can tell the difference between you, @BillKristol and Beto😡
@AP When Obama enacted DACA the courts said President determines immigration policy, but when Pres Trump does it court says President can’t control immigration policy😳
@TheSilentLOUD @RyalsRita @realDonaldTrump Too bad you are brainwashed 🙄 most Americans want Daca comprehensive immigration laws, chain migration as you call it and 90% of these.

@realDonaldTrump When Obama enacted DACA Court sad immigration is at Presidents discretion, when Trump did it, they ruled it unlawful.🙄🙄🙄
@RealCandaceO @sherrynron Yeah, their brainlessMother took those little girls right into harms way trying to storm the border of a sober nation because you idiots in Congress can't pass correct immigration laws. I blame the Democrats who refused the Daca offer from POTUS. Politics 😡
