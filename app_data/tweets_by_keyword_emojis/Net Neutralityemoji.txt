@Postsue1 @MarybethMkprudz What is this about? What is net neutrality? Sorry Im from Australia so pardon my ignorance 😊
@Ocasio2018 Like we died from net neutrality, tax cuts, repealing the Obamacare mandate, the Kavanaugh confirmation, oh &amp; Trump....🙄  Here we go again, same song, different bullsh*t.
COMCAST USES OAK RIDGE CITY GOVERNMENT TO HELP DESTROY NET NEUTRALITY AND MAKE OAK RIDGE AN UNDER ACHIEVER WITH A BROADBAND SCORE OF 20 WITH 7 PROVIDERS?👍🤔❓ KNOXVILLE SCORES 52? OAK RIDGE, CLINTON, KINGSTON, OLIVER SPRINGS ARE ALL LABELED AS BROADBAND UNDER ACHIEVERS;
Yo, what happened to net neutrality?💀
I'm always happy to hear arguments contrary to my own view (e.g. on net neutrality, less-so burgers) so link me to some evidence that back up your claims. 👍

@bitchingrays 😲😲😲 oh wow that's crazy.. reminds me us when net neutrality first came up here (and then his behind other news so it can sneakily make itself legal under the table with no one noticing)
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Most of the stuff you posted are good things he did. Are you one of the people that said everything would fall apart after net neutrality? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Professor told me to come up with a "creative" title for my paper over Net Neutrality, so I titled it using @Eminem lyrics 😎🤷🏼‍♀️
😂😂😂
ISPs were screwing people as much as they could be4 the rules went into effect, while they were law &amp; they will do so more openly after the repeal. Plus they used BS corporate propaganda like "it stifled innovation" &amp; "caused uncertainty in the market" 🙄
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenMikeLee @SenSanders You only have until December 10 to restore net neutrality. PLEASE!🙏🙏🙏
@salenstormwing @sunoxen @DrJaneRuby @Barnes_Law What's really funny is that the Obama FCC actually tried to classify broadband as Title II (net neutrality) which would have allowed the FCC to treat ISPs as common carriers. These same 4 Loko-guzzling MAGAts lost their shit. Idgit Pai stopped it. 😂
Y’all remember when everyone was freaking out about Net Neutrality? 😂😂

@DailyCaller Impossible.  I already died when net neutrality was repealed.  Literally tweeting this from the grave 👻💀
Reminder that Net Neutrality is still important incase you forgot. 👌👌
@RoczRed @irritatedwoman Well- Europe also said ‘yes’ to “net neutrality”, so their decision making cannot always be relied upon.😉
@FCC says we don't need #NetNeutrality because "market forces" can prevent abuse. Over here in reality, I've been stuck with @comcast or @verizon as my only ISP choice in three different cities 🙄
@bnmi_thafool why does this kinda sound like our net neutrality thing 😭
@Mark_Goldberg @AjitPaiFCC The Steelers are pro net neutrality? 😁
@Adi_T_ibA @wmd4x Yeah.  The idea that you need net neutrality for bitcoin shows you just how little people understand about it.  OG's out here sending coin via walkie talkie.  😂🤣

Remember how COAI used to spend its time trying to gut net neutrality and championing Free Basics in India? Apparently now they spend that time trying to ban movies like Rajinikanth’s new #2Point0 for hurting the sentiments of cell phone networks and mobile operators 🤦🏽‍♀️ Vetti!

The Commission will adopt today a "Strategic Vision for a Clean Planet". It will show that Europe can and should achieve net-0 GHG by 2050. 👏
@Ocasio2018 Also: People are going to die from the lack of net neutrality.  People are also going to die from Trump’s tax cuts.  People are going to die from socialism. Oh wait. That last one is really true. Darn facts. lol 😂😂

Dear Cindy Customer Service: Please refund the money we paid for the talking Senator Doll item # 2018. The item is not at all as it was depicted in the catalog.

@bigolfoot We've already died 3 times according to them. Tax reduction, ending net neutrality and Paris Accord withdrawal killed everyone...🙄
🚨 #NetNeutrality day of action. Every member of Congress should support and help save the open internet! Congress should vote to protect their constituents—not big telecom companies. If your reps are on here, tell them to stand up for our rights! https://t.co/VxZuyUeNmH
@wrytersview @N64jamesy @Gamerheadspc IMO I think so. Comcast, att, Verizon and others are losing tons of premium subscription money to Netflix, hulu and other streamers and they will have to make up for the huge losses. Cable companies will get their money somehow😂 net neutrality will happen.This could be expensive
@AmirAminiMD @BethLynch2020 If only she would convince corporate Dems of this same logic in regards to Socialism. “To beat socialism we must pass Medicare For All, Free College, &amp; Net Neutrality.” 😎
