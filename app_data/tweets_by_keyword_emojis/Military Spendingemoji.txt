It brings me great joy to box up at least 100 letters and 100 drawing to send overseas to military personnel who will not be spending the holidays with their families. Thank you @MsAnayaMVW for helping with the letters so that we can spread some joy! ❤️❤️❤️ #Thankful #MVWES https://t.co/8foeqYlKSH
@SenWarren I want to back to the days of sending billions to dictators and terrorist regimes as a foreign policy rather than above board, ethical and honest spending to a stated military budget. How many years did Democrats deny raises to military? Ah, those were the good ole days huh? 😬🤪
@Jeggit Mm... the reason UK and US spending so much on military operations in Middle East is purely out of altruistic desire to promote democracy &amp; environmental issues.  Nothing to do with oil whatsoever. 😶
👍DELIVERS ON THE REFERENDUM.
👍IS GOOD FOR SECURITY AND ORDER WITH A HUGE INCREASE IN MILITARY SPENDING.
👍SAVES VASTS AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON COSTLY ELECTIONS.
thank you to all those who are working today instead of spending it with their families, whether that be military, medical, or even just retail ❤️
@radish2020 😂 “I know they’re talking about different kinds of sanctions, but they’re spending $110B on military equipment and on things that create jobs, like jobs and others for this country. I don’t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the US.” -Trump, 10/11/18
@TheRickyDavila This is rich coming from a guy who has never served in the military (because of bone spurs 😒) and is spending his Thanksgiving with his family at a cushy golf club.
Where is president Trump spending #Thanksgiving this year? With our troops overseas? Stateside? Nope. He's at Mar a Lago. He really does love the military. 🙄(Photo: Christine Davis) https://t.co/UONrWz0UBp

But... but... the army wants to keep us in a state of perpetual war with India to keep military spending up. Don't you see 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
Thanks 🙏🏻@realDonaldTrump US Military &amp; ICE for keeping our borders safe!
Yes Fantastic 😑 (sarcasm)
BlueDot is veteran-owned so we cannot miss the chance to recognize @FisherHouseFdtn who support military families around the world spending their holidays in hospitals, fighting for health. 🇺🇸💌 Give to Fisher House and your support will be matched today: https://t.co/IEd9FfiQFC
@mkraju @rabrowne75 @barbarastarrcnn That was Trump's "🖕 you" to the US for not spending the $20 mil on his military parade. As with all stupid things Trump, he doubled down and got his "parade" anyway...🙄
Obama’s hidden military strategy should shock us all 😳😳
@RednexPunk @TopRopeTravis Do you have fire departments, police departments, public education, public transit, infrastructure spending &amp; the military in the US? Ohhhh the US is socialist too. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Putting people first. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump Here's a thought... instead of spending millions of dollars sending our military to the border, shift to enforcing harsh fines against business owners who hire illegals. Establish thumbprint identification software for short-term work permits. Work with brown communities.😱

@steve_pppp Russia is a military superpower just like the US. The bottom line is they can do whatever they want just like the US. Until countries start spending much more on their own militaries to be able to fight back there is nothing we can do. Even if it is unjust and totally wrong 😎
Keep up the great work POTUS👍👍

What we are against is sending troops to the border spending $milllions to sit there and not be able to do anything by law lol. Smoke and mirrors. Families traveling for 1000s of miles is a real threat 🙄
@antifashyst @24sales2U @Hellfire233 @LPFeinberg @realDonaldTrump I said “around 70%”. Sorry you took that so literally I didn’t have #s in front of me. Of course I was including social security and Medicare. They alone will comprise of 62% of total spending for 2019. Military spending will be around 3 times less than that. Again...”around” 😂
This is one of the reasons “We The People” must demand earmarks against our Defense Spending are voted down .. Military Strength is the USA’s biggest deterrent against “Enemies of the State” Don’t be fooled by the Dems! Keep America Strong ✅🇺🇸 https://t.co/qDc3CzTMuu

Chief of Staff John Kelly asked the President to guess the salary of the nation’s highest ranking military officer. Trump said $5 million. 😳 (It’s less than $200,000.)
I'll be spending my holiday without my daughter because there's no Public Safety in New Jersey and we don't have a MILITARY that protect MILITARY FAMILIES so I want 2thank you ALL I hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving with your FAMILY mines been affected by DOMESTIC VIOLENCE💔

These military men here act as if I’m in NDA or Police Academy!! Many of us go home with so many reactions and infections and we are paid N19500. I spent over 40k coming to this prison called NYSC CAMP and i don’t think I’m spending lesser going home 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
In 2017 USA spent 590 BILLION dollars on military spending but free college &amp; giving asylum to South American’s running from war is socialism 🙄🙄🙄🙄 give me a fucking break
How much does the US military waste on reckless spending...ridiculous things like a $280 coffee mug 😳
@Priz It’s resistance to universal health care and gun control coupled with military spending that will prevent change. America let capitalists have their way. No other developed country could afford to and so common sense took hold generations ago. Hard to see America changing. 😢
This is one clueless Congressional Rep. If the GOP can hand out trillions in tax cuts from our taxpayer pockets and expand military spending by $165 billion over two years I s'pose we could feed the people. What an inane query you ninny. 👎🏾 https://t.co/hvlFYAj8nt
He thinks they have a 9-5 job with weekends &amp; holidays off.😂
Really sad that i might be spending my Thanksgiving without my other half because the Military doesnt care about its members or their families 😔
He says he loves the military then he does nothing to help those who served 🙄
Happy Thanksgiving to all military women and men who are spending it  without the comfort of home and the solace of their families gathered around them in a safe space.  God bless you. Thank you for your service! 🙏🏽
It's just pictures of Presidents spending Thanksgiving dinner with the troops. What's the big deal?? Oh you mean trump?? They were all military too, they just dressed in "civies" . Military doesn't have to wear uniforms on Thanksgiving Day...try again Libtard!🙄
@realDonaldTrump Unprecedented threat? If instead of spending millions bringing military to Mexican border, you set up processing centers to hear their petitions, you would not have this chaos. You’ve made these people even more desperate. Leading to violence?  Maybe. 😱
@JesseBalcazar @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SecWilkie @kayleighmcenany Haha Democrats are the worse thing possibly for the nation and what world - lol 😂 u liberals aren’t going to stop Bitching and lying - Obama disrespected and hurt our military... dems cut military spending ... cut vet (va) bills... all dems care about is votes.. gays and immigra

@TheBeatWithAri @CLewandowski_ What a laugh CL calls #PaulManafort a “serial liar.” A classic #hypocritical move &amp; blindly &amp; #ironically #hilarious. #CoreyLewendowski is a #joke. He #lies &amp; his #stridency is #boring. Yes, Moron Reagan lowered #taxes &amp; raised #military spending, leaving us w/a huge #deficit. 🤣
- Stock Market on🔥
@realDonaldTrump I watched &amp; listened to the show in its entirety. You were wonderful &amp; I know the military were proud to talk with you. You expressed gratitude to all. Now I hear that the House may try to cut defense spending. I can’t believe it. Your loyal base is with you Mr President ❤️🇺🇸❤️
@CNN A small group of mexican officers stoped the 300 unarmed migrants from reaching the border. Your president sent hundreds of military armed forces, spending millions of tax payers money, really? 😂🤣 @realDonaldTrump #StopWastingMoney #FocusOnRealProblems https://t.co/lyszJGLrjp
wtf? 😏
@LibyaLiberty @Cmt330 “What are they supposed to do here?” Easy answer; instead of spending millions to send our military down there for a political stunt, spend those millions on immigration attorneys, judges and a system to properly and quickly process these refugees for asylum! Fuck Trump!👎
@sapien_one @JLRees @ABC7Kevin it's hilarious that after spending $972 millions on its first ever audit, the #war department congratulated itself even when it FAILED the audit...🇺🇸💵😏
Something heavy on my heart...please remember not everyone will be spending Thanksgiving with their families tomorrow. Please pray for our men and women who are currently serving in the military, so that we can enjoy days like tomorrow❤️
Extremely thankful for the men and women in the military and first responders that won’t be spending thanksgiving with their families this year...you guys rock ❤️
@milenaac @LEBassett @juliaioffe But you all hate military spending dont you? And condemn the yemen proxy war without knowing the wider implications. But you all love to bitch and complain while you clutch your pearls😒
Trump has added a shit ton of money to military spending but can't - won't - support our vets. 😡 Pay them! https://t.co/Q5qcZIBiKY
We all benefit from a strong military! No deal should be made to fund it He gave libs 600 Billion 😢 https://t.co/SSROLHL6H6
my least favorite thing about today is the fact that isaac will be spending it alone. ☹️ we have only spent 1/4 Thanksgivings that we’ve been together.. with eachother.
thank you, my love. ❤️ https://t.co/4oD8hND0mg
................lol but wait a min, I actually want to see this "space force" 😭
@pitbullmomof4 @thedirtbirdwran @haymarketbooks @ChristianV_96 @lexi4prez 🤣🤣🤣 no just please explain essential military spending in the 600 billion dollar range. Literally dying to here this
@LindaF85594859 @realDonaldTrump Since you’d like to take care of this country first, let’s eliminate a large portion of our military spending, and spending to go to florida every other day and we could definitely help a lot mire people! 👌🏻
make sure you appreciate being with your family this thanksgiving! being away from mine during the holidays is the worst feeling. if the military has taught me anything, it's that we take too much for granted, especially little things like spending a few hours with the fam. 🤙🏼
Military took all my birthdays away turned 17 at MEPS swearing in , graduated basic on my 18th , MUTA 4 drill on my 19th , now my 20th I’m spending overseas 🤦🏾‍♂️
did on Thanksgiving instead of spending time visiting with the military like previous presidents did. 🤢 ~~&gt; 🤮 https://t.co/4JJh4i02MX
🚨 RT if you think he should visit them! #Mexico https://t.co/5xOEkiMnyp
Fucking moron🙄
Yes Fantastic 😑 (sarcasm)…
@NebraskaPatriot @MagpieBloody @KaitMarieox Oh yeah, because as we know, Republicans are big fans of holding police responsible for use of force, removing all corporate power from government, legalizing all drugs, slashing military spending dramatically, etc. 🤦‍♂️
@channelstv This man is not even ashamed of splitting out shit for mouth.... how can govt be saying terrorist has weapons and drones more than the military,they are not spending billions on what they are using to kill people but govt spend billions to fight them 🤦‍♂️
@pitbullmomof4 @thedirtbirdwran @haymarketbooks @ChristianV_96 @lexi4prez 🤣🤣🤣🤣 essential military spending.
@NYTnickc @RepJoshG @MikieSherrill @JeffVanDrew 😨😡🤮 Spending trillions on military spending to bomb poor brown people in other countries is not fiscally responsible. What is the point of “flipping districts blue” if you end up with people like this?
@reggiewatts @googlenews If USA military spending is any indication of how good the USA is at estimating costs, it'll be way higher than that 😵😵😵
@djchrisallen @neiltyson Don’t get me started on military spending 😂😂😂
For the ❤ #love ❤ of our men &amp; women who are serving/have served in our #Military, never ever give this turkey a pardon! 👇
U may not LIKE him, but can’t deny he’s ABSOLUTELY turned our ECONOMY around 👍
I don't want to hear it's about money when your wife is spending $95,000 for a 6hr stay in a hotel. 👎👎👎 https://t.co/W7Z9mwTaqR

@sherrysue66 @realDonaldTrump Sigh. You and POTUS both need to learn how NATO works. There's an agreement for members to raise their spending on their own military defense to 2% GDP by 2024. They're on track to meet that. NATO isn't a country club that has membership dues. 🙄 https://t.co/AbJe7Pmml3
