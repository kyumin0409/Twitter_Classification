@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President!  Please keep working on fixing the mess Obamacare made of our health insurance system!! Our families premiums are outrageous now &amp; then we still can't afford to go to the Dr. due to deductibles at $5000/person! 😡
@lyn_cade 😂🤣😅!! They hated Obamacare, but the loved the ACA!
