Knowing that China is the biggest CO2 emitter on the planet, Trump just did more for the climate with his tariffs and MCA deal than any “green” NGO or over funded government study. 👌🏻

@realDonaldTrump Jesus, D, that's not how tariffs work 🤦🏽‍♂️
@realDonaldTrump @StephenMoore Donald, you don’t have any economic policies. You don’t even know that Americans pay the tariffs, not China! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Nicknaming Pres. D. Trump "Pong" just so I can say Ping Pong Match occurring between USA &amp; China. LOL! ROTF. 🤣 Personally, I consider Donald's 25% tariff threat as a Bluff. Can't imagine occurring. Maybe 10Ks of workers benefiting from tariffs vs 10s of millions consumers losing

A generation ago, North Carolina was a leading furniture manufacturing state. Today, thanks to @realDonaldTrump and his #MAGA tariffs to discourage furniture imports from China, furniture and the related jobs will move to Vietnam. Brilliant. God help us from this incompetence. 🤐

@richieny70 @IvankaTrump @POTUS @USTradeRep @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 @JustinTrudeau @EPN Once again, he’s not producing goods that have tariffs placed on them.  FYI, places like China need our products and IP far more than US companies need them for their cheap labor.  I know you think you’re trolling me, but you’re not 😇
Oh yeah. 😢 https://t.co/TICJ5zxNC2

I love the way @realDonaldTrump answered the questions about Trade tariffs with China‼️ He said China wants to make a deal but he kind of likes it the way it is right now🤣🤣 In other words he likes screwing China for a change🤣🤣🤣Hahaha
🤦‍♂️
RT @MichalTarny: @realDonaldTrump 🤥 NO NEW STEEL plants
@realDonaldTrump tariffs are a tax on U.S. consumers and companies. No money is coming into U.S. coffers from China (or anywhere else) from tariff payments. Zero. 🤦🏼‍♂️ It’s hard to pick on Bernie or Ocasio-Cortez about economic illiteracy when you’re out there taking the cake. 🙄
Trump’s fans believe this lie while unknowingly paying more for💰increased goods from Tariffs -Not China 🇨🇳 /FoxNews &amp; Right wingers Won’t  Tell them😂 Trump says tariffs make the US “richer than ever before.” They don’t. - Vox https://t.co/lUmWjCoQMU
@realDonaldTrump Billions of Dollars go to Treasury because of Tariffs to China and other countries.Great deal.WISE MAN!👍
@realDonaldTrump Tariffs are being paid by American importers, NOT by China. 😡
Because of these tariffs, everything imported from China will have a higher price tag for all of us! 😡
I don't know why Trump is happy about making almost everything at Walmart more expensive!?! 😡

@Becky91663 @tagteam421 @ddale8 Until Trump's steel tariff, 99% of Canada &amp; US trade was 0 tariffs, Canada with lower avg tariff rate. A country the population of California has been the biggest importer of US goods, (more than China, Japan) but taking advantage of the US? 🤣 U believe everything Trump says 🐑
Leave the Chinese Communist on their own!!😎
Analysts predict slim chance of resolution✅
@WhiteHouse Awesome! Great job for America! I see a deal with China and India brewing! It's telling that China has already lifted tariffs on most products #AmericaFirst #MAGA #kag #promiseskept ❤🇺🇸
👏👏👏with new USMexCan treaty china can no longer launder their parts through mexico to avoid paying tariffs. The Euro nations did it too and this stupidity stops when its ratified by our nations.
@kderosa @evansiegfried @charlescwcooke And where's the study about China tariffs on American products? It's also China producers that are paying China tariffs on American products? 😂

@China can these tariffs just affect Trump supporters? The rest of us don’t like him OR them, either ☹️

@realDonaldTrump Spanky, your tariffs are NOT charged to China, they are charged to American consumers! The tariff money is money taken from Americans! You are so dense. The whole world is laughing at you and the US. Please end this pathetic excuse of a presidency and RESIGN! 😡
@NTLiveStream Who knows maybe China will lift duties and tariffs on its imports, decide to quit cheating with the WTO and quit manipulating its currency 🤷🏻‍♂️. It could happen.... 😎🇺🇸
China might as well become a western colony again. 🙄
