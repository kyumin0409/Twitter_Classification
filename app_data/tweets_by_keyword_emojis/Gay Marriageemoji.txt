توي أكتشف إن أمس تكلمت عن الـGay marriage عند اليمقراطيين والجمهوريين في أمريكا في البرزنتيشن مالي وأحس الحمدلله محد عطاني ذيك النظرات Amst colleagues are the best💕💘💘💗💓💞
.@Grindr's President Scott Chen needs to be fired. 😤
Then when you ask them to bake the cake they say they won't ......because they can.😏
it's so funny how ignorant people only get bothered about sexual harrasment when it has a homosexual involved other than that they are pro rape but GOD NO by legalizing gay marriage evwry straight guy is gonna be raped by a gay one HAHAHAHHA batal fiye😂 they're ao stupid
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
@MachineStopper @edoconn2 Thats unfortunate. There goes the majority of the world population. I hate tell to you but at least in my faith (Roman Catholic) being gay isn’t a sin. Just the act. Not discrimination, just not for sex outside of marriage. Long story, no time and I gtg so have a nice day 👋 gbye
What changes do you hope to see in the world by 2020? — trump gone 😌💅, more ppl happy, gay marriage legal in more countries https://t.co/vnj2wyeQFS
Wait the president of Grindr is straight and against gay marriage? 😭😭😭
This makes me extremely sad ⁦@IrishRugby⁩ it’s a really bad showing when ⁦@USARugby⁩ is standing in solidarity with Gareth. Please change your mind on this, surely if we can legalize Gay Marriage in this country we can support this cause ☘️🌈 https://t.co/vFos0xfUYn
@itsjoemate00 And it would still be called gay marriage 😂😭❤️
Je reprends It's always sunny... après genre... cinq ans d'interruption. À partir de la saison 6. "Mac fights gay marriage". 😂
A sad sad Sunday for all my friends in  #Taiwan thinking of you ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 https://t.co/I5NBWPF7Bg
@smichaels1989 @WeAreOne_Q This will bring u confort 2 u as an Evil Conservative Christian. As Gay Person I'm afraid of the new SCOTUS. I bet Gay Marriage will be stopped &amp; u Conservative Christians get ur Constitutional Amendment say'n marriage is only between a man &amp; woman. 😠
This country is fucked up 😥😥😥 https://t.co/Y9N9L2wFvw

เมื่อวานนี้ที่ไต้หวันมีการลงประชามติเพื่อหยั่งเสียงของประชาชนเกี่ยวกับการผ่านกฎหมายอนุญาตแต่งงานเพศเดียวกัน ผลปรากฏว่ามีคนโหวตคัดค้าน 7 ล้านคน ในขณะที่มีคนโหวตสนับสนุนเพียง 3 ล้านคนเท่านั้น ความหวังในการเป็นประเทศแรกของเอเชียดับสลายลงทันที 😢😢 #LGBTQ🌈

@DeasyWebb Same sex marriage is a step in right detection yes, how ever there is many challenges that Gay people etc.. still face in the world. Swear to me yes I want better world 4 Traveller community. How I see it is we are all different in r own right but of equal value worth to world ❤
It’s not that I think gay marriage is wrong or right.....it’s that I mind my own business and treat everyone with respect. 😊
Three days until election day! Byrd's focus for today is marriage rights in America. She is going to work towards gay marriage being legal in every state. Byrd believes nobody she be discriminated against because of their their sexuality!! 🦅🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈 #itsyouramerica

Tan and Jonathan corrected Tom's misconception about the husband/wife dichotomy in a gay marriage. It was a beautiful thing to watch. The conversation was handled with compassion and understanding by both parties. 💞🙏🏽

DUP terrified of any societal change. That equals loss of control. But change will come. Enormous changes down here, society out from under the boot of the Church. Gay marriage Repealed the 8th. A feeling of tolerance &amp; freedom. It will spread to the North 🌈🌈🌈 https://t.co/OjUdMGCSoR
They never asked again. 😁
الحمدلله انه ما لحق على الgay marriage ولا كان علوووم 🏃🏻‍♂️😂
I’ll never understand people who claim to be Christians agreeing that our military should open fire on immigrants. I guess that’s God’s will meanwhile gay marriage is a fucking problem. Who knew Jesus would be on the side of killing poor people seeking refuge? 🤷🏽‍♀️🙄
@Jin_is_hyung gay marriage isn’t legal in Korea 😔 for this particular au it is tho.. let’s just say that.
@m_reegz Pic stolen from you - thanks☺. Change is incremental. Things aren't where we would like them to be, but, when I was young, the thought of gay marriage was inconceivable. Gay characters on TV or in movies? Few and far between. So much progress has been made. More to come. https://t.co/VsxMErr1wW
me in court, arguing for the legalization of gay marriage, staring at scalia dead in the eyes but addressing rbg: remember in lawrence v. texas how scalia was worried that legalizing sodomy would lead to gay marriage? how about we make that prediction come true huh? 😏😉😘
The point is - you can gay marry all you want in Croatia. 🦄✨🤘💕 https://t.co/PmUxjmuPpL

What would you have emailed him to say? That gay marriage is OK and homosexual and lesbian behavior is not a sin? 🤦‍♂️
If I know people in Taiwan this vote against same-sex marriage will be a minor set back in their progress towards a more egalitarian society. The anti-same sex marriage vote was funded by Conservatives and was a last ditch attempt to halt progress 🌈🌈🌈 https://t.co/W6JxDfJ2mn
#australia 🏄🏼‍♂️ is an AWESOME country and since gay marriage is legal in #australia 🦘 that country is swell 🤙🏼 i’m totes gonna move to #australia 🐨
