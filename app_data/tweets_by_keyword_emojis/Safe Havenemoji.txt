Hope all in AK are doing ok! Haven't heard of any injuries thus far. We can certainly relate here in Los Angeles. Watching AK footage of people running for cover and photos of damaged roads is giving me major flashbacks to Northridge in '94. The quakes felt eternal. Stay safe! 🙏🏽

Inclusiveness is so crucial in the theatre community, so when I hear intolerance, I INSTANTLY take a stand because the theater should be a safe haven. You are creating a family when you put together a production. Your family’s love should be unconditional; no place for hate. ❤️ https://t.co/amaZaBsgfX
I haven't been this happy on Thanksgiving in years and I owe that to the people in my life today. I am very thankful for all of you and for what you have taught me. the lessons I've experienced are so valuable and I am fortunate to have learned from them. be safe everybody! 💙

@mister_CMS @DavidOpie I'm giving thanks also for the tweet &amp; for your existence in the world as well. You are so kind and genuine, Cory.
