@AP He's not being asked to take the display down, he's being asked to take responsibility for the massive disruption his display causes. That's not a First Amendment issue 🙄 I think there should be a different solution, but the town is correct to expect him to take responsibility
I’m doing research for my paper on K-12 students first amendment rights &amp; there’s a case where a girl refused to stop wearing Confederate Flag shirts although she kept getting reprimanded by her school 🤦🏽‍♀️ then sued because they wouldn’t change their policy
@lkb273 @Rmdig79 @stateanopinion @iesadur @rbcaruso67 @NRA Third. Louis Farrakhan is free to use his first amendment to call Jewish people insects and rats but you’re OK with that it’s his first amendment. Witch could potentially cause his followers to follow the path of hitler 👍
