Wouldn’t it be the best if the Mexican President decides he wanted the border wall even more than @realDonaldTrump! I wonder how the media would spin that one 😂😂😂😂 #BuildThatWall #maga
@NewDay @Acosta Keep those thousands of caravan immigrants on the Mexican side of the border and Mexico may consider some wall funding. We could build in partnership with Mexico. 😊
@BorderIrish I thought you was a fertile Border, Border; when the 'we can change our minds at any time' kicks in, perhaps you'll get a south facing wall and Jean can harvest the sprouts for ever more, as for the truss, thread each sprout through the middle until it can hold up something,..😇

We don't need a wall. Just put 45 at the border and everyone will keep away. 🤣😂🤣 #Resist #NotMyPresident https://t.co/94OMz73Aja

@ACTBrigitte Most politicians are loyal to the ppl/entities that funded their campaigns. If the financial backers don’t want them to vote or fund a border wall, they won’t. It’s infuriating 🤬😡.

we all have to lay for the border wall since there was no mention of it in the new trade deal?? aome of yall were stupid enough to believe trump could make a country pay for something they dont want 😂😂😂

@POTUS @VP Sirs it is time to play hard ball with Congress... Close Southern Border Until Congress funds entire Wall &amp; Change Immigrantion Law.   Thank you Both for your hard daily work to MAGA🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍
@LindaSuhler @atensnut With the caravan taking over the Mexican border, Mexico may pay for a wall 😉
@realDonaldTrump Dude it’s essentially the same deal. You just changed the name and added a few things.  😂😂😂😂. Oh and I guess Mexico isn’t paying for the “Border Wall” huh?
🇺🇸👍🇺🇸
@MikeBloomberg If the Mexican Border Wall were to be built it would give the United States a major Boost in control of this Opioid Epidemic. Cheers 🍻.
@IoWBobSeely You'd he surprised how much support there is for a wall. I mean, honestly, if I was American I'd support it too! The southern border is constantly being stormed by migrants and there's nothing the state can do to hold them out effectively. Europe could do with a wall right now 😂

Nearly every week the Obama administration sued oil/gas producers for manufactured concerns. That somehow didn't stop him from taking credit for the U.S. now being the world's #1 oil producer😀  Soon he will be saying that he had already made plans for a border wall  🤥  Unreal
@Ocasio2018 @kathygriffin Border walls aren't racist 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 senate is us kiddo, we will have our wall either this way or through national defense funds, as it is a national defense issue not a color one. Stupid people I swear.
