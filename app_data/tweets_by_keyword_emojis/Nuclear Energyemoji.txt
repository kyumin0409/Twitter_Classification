@DavidHembrow @PlasticPlanners @NickForster4 The energy delivered to an electric train is not necessarily clean, as it can be from nuclear or coal. The latter uses steam generators 🤣. Clean this up with hydro, solar and wind plants and you could run trains carbon-neutral. Point taken on the infra though.

@janhaverkamp @dietwaldclaus 😂 If you take off your greenpeace-glasses you’d notice the Belgian energy-pact proposes to build gas-plants to replace the -maybe- retiring nuclear plants in the ‘20s. So much for ‘viable alternatives’. And please, don’t answer my tweet with future demand-response and storage.

Good night, and sweet dreams. 😁
I was trying to find costs over entire cycle, and found article above, where carbon intensity is quoted much below the IPCC figures. In any instance wind energy seems a great option, overall. Cheers for sharing 👍
I think I'd take this talk more seriously if nuclear power wasn't immediately dismissed as a real alternative. My (jaded) take? Too little 💰 💰 in that option. Push for less proven &amp; less effecient energy sources = 🤑🤑🤑 (in the guise of "being green")
With that jolly thought, bedtime 😊.

@KayBrannigan The nuclear power industry contributed £1 billion to Scotland's economy last year and supports more than 12,000 jobs. The energy that was generated at Torness and Hunterston B produced carbon savings that were the equivalent of taking almost all cars off the road in Scotland. 😁

In a moment of delirium, I told someone the other day that coal (confusing it with nuclear energy) was clean 🤦🏻‍♀️. To whomever that was, I’m an idiot.
@jeffwhelpley @andrestaltz @Rendez I agree with the 100% electric cars. My fear though is that the energy production will be too slow and thus nations (as they do already) go to nuclear energy for producing electricity (which again won't be sustainable 😞)
@crbikebike There are risks but today's tech is vastly superior to that being deployed decades ago. Also, France gets around 40% of its power from nuclear. There's a lot of money to be made (and lost) in green energy. Green is also the color of 💵 😉
@BischofNiemz I don’t know of any other energy technology where the capacity factor goes up as the plant ages. Indicative of the continued advancements in the nuclear sector! We can expect the new designs to do even better! 😳
@dcol9186 @BillBis88791192 @KarlNeubauer @mcannonbrookes @1petermartin @JulieBishopMP That solar and wind are a cleaner option to coal, no doubt. But at the  rate we are expected to increase energy consumption in years to come,  they will not be nearly enough to keep up with demand (increasing  prices). The solution? Nuclear. Hence the delayed closure 😉

@isthatabigail Nuclear energy is used as an alternative source of energy for fossil fuels. The energy is created in a nuclear reactor. You don't have to be nuclear expert,just open your physics revision book to the end of chapter 5 of Form 5 okay😉.
