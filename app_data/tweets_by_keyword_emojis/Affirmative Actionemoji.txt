@JamesADamore "Diversity of opinion" is a lazy way of saying affirmative action for white people. 😂🤣
@lporiginalg Are the sheeple ever going to make the connection in their sheepy minds that affirmative action IS sexism/racism?🙄
Hmm😂
@outseide @NicasioSilang We both kind of froze and let the guy finish then had a long talk in the car about how to handle it when the guy doing your permanent ink is denouncing affirmative action. 😱
It's for learned people like you to tell others that they are helping their brethren who deserve such affirmative action.🙏 Thank you sir!
Fox Sports should never show their staff again.  They just proved they're only worried about covering their "Affirmative action "😂😂😂

@manishduttmd @asqdri @sanjayuvacha @Swap_Sarit @nilasara I worked at a Fortune 500 company abroad nd have come across plenty of squealing Brahminical thugs like u.

The only food that will@come out of this is affirmative action for whites. Not sure why they hate white people so much, after all they foot most of the bills the layabouts generate.🧐😎 https://t.co/GBuNmmzdvz

@RN_Atheist @docrocktex26 I thought being a minority was a big advantage.  With all the affirmative action, free stuff and what not. 🙄 You’d think some white voters were threatened with the pits of Hell the way they react to changing USA demographics. 🇺🇸
Thank you President Trump it's about time someone took some affirmative action and actually implemented safety for America..😎 https://t.co/dAo50ZpzAb
@ExposeNonsense @ABC How many white people who were the most qualified candidates to fill a position lost the job to a lesser qualified candidate due to affirmative action? Yeah, white people never experience racism. 😂
@TigerSphinx Because they are AFFIRMATIVE ACTION appointees from the DNC Michigan and Minnesota branches. Their training ground is in Dearborn, Mi and Islamberg, NY!!!☠️☠️☠️👍🇺🇸
The rhetoric white people use against affirmative action is the same one being used against the 2/3 #Genderrule. When you're privileged, equity to achieve equality feels like oppression. They're really out here acting like it's a women's bill, not a gender bill, men included. 😒
@lmorris1908 @MrsGJW I’ve been through those channels and am now working with the department of equity and diversity, along with the affirmative action department. I’ve also been in contact with the deputy superintendent. It’s a slow process, making change. 😕

@CBSNews similar to affirmative action in order to make sure that there isn’t any discrimination...add a reverse discrimination view. Beneficial for someone like me to exceedingly profit under unfair demographic guidelines. Colleges have endorsed diversity by groups, clubs and division 🤦‍♂️
私：それで共和党に投票しちゃったの？😵😵😵
@BlackSocialists I’ve had affirmative action pointed out to me as an unfair advantage as a response during a conversation about racial inequality. There are conservatives that believe not only are POC not disadvantaged, but actually systematically advantaged😑
This is why the DA is hell bent on changing the Affirmative Action policy, they want to get in as many people in the system because really we’re intimidating them with our qualifications 😂

@GeorgeDolan17 @Trollitarian @Trinity45229188 @Purity_Of_Truth @RealJamesWoods Ok idiots, you're referring to Nixon. Nixon led segregation of southern schools, America's first affirmative action program, supported the Civil Rights Act 1964 and Voting Rights Act 1965. Dixiecrats stayed Democrats. The south changed to Red with industrialization not racism👌🇺🇸

@rolandsmartin White women count! As nation’s foremost sociologists said in early ‘90s, the GREATEST beneficiaries of affirmative action laws, regs &amp; policies = white men.

Lmao what are you gonna do in 20 years when you’re the minority? Ask for affirmative action? 😂😂😂
@RagingGayCons Jobs and promotions should be based on qualifications. Affirmative action made women and minorities not try to raise their skill set. They were guaranteed positions due to their gender or ethnicity. Both women and minorities deserve better! IMHO...😊

Affirmative action was introduced to increase diversity in schools like Harvard. If they got rid of it there would be a disproportionate large amount of Asians/whites with a low amount of black/Hispanic/others.

@RagingGayCons I think it's a great idea! Basing Affirmative Action on income would be an actual action in the affirmative! Good idea! I'm pretty sure there are no plantation 'slaves' still alive who are looking for a job.🙂

@getalife108 @anuragmathur95 @KaptanHindustan @ReallySwara We have to believe that affirmative action and positive communication will help in discrimination less society.
