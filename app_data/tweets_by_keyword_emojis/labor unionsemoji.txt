We never want that again. 😕
This thread is a nice sum of challenges to labor organizing in higher ed (not just anthro), &amp; yet NTT faculty unions *are* forming &amp; negotiating meaningful contracts, even in right-to-work states like NC where organizing conditions are 👎. It can be done &amp; there are models. https://t.co/R6bdSo45d6
Then, join us at Mad Oak at 9 pm for Beer and Roses: DSA Labor Social to learn more about what we’re doing to support unions in your backyard! 🍻🌹 https://t.co/LqLNjcbcIT
It's inspiring to see labor unions, student groups, the AFL-CIO, NGOs, media activists, farm and industrial workers, anarchists and others here today in Seattle at the protest. We will not stand for the WTO. #Resist #AntiWTO #SaveOurEnvironment 👊🙋‍♀️ https://t.co/odZDkxMilz
@thescribe01 @GetUp @abc730 @PaulOosting @unionsaustralia @AustralianLabor "Not people power - just Labor and unions"😂
Adorable😊
This is for real! @QueerEye's @jvn talks to Rutgers labor professor @rkgwork about #Unions &amp; why they're popular with #millenials. Listen up 😀 https://t.co/AwzyJ7Gs4K
@VictoryGirl1977 @patrickadownes @SaintFrankly Well your answer sums it up lol but ol joe blow wanting a hand from unions doing fuck all/nothing, is on his way out the door like everyone else when they see where there value for money is. Is every labor voter like you?😣

Paul has approved PTO for Friday and now his boss is going to make him work anyway. But yeah Paul, keep telling me how labor unions accomplish nothing but protect the lazy 🙄😡
@arch2tch @slpng_giants_oz @ozpacman Pygmies! 😂... that could be what I call #LaborLiarsCabal
Labor’s strong sense of purpose is to graft and rort as much power and money for itself and Unions #pmlive 👎😡

doing some archive work today, and leave it to the good old NYT, Sept. 9, 1907: LABOR UNIONS DESTROYED ROME...CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH A BENEFIT 🤣🤣🤣🤣
But hey, if if makes you feel better to try to put me in some GOP box, knock yourself out dude. Apparently you dont read people's profiles🙄

@alan_john_moran @FinancialReview Alan I must disagree with on this one ☝️ it wasn’t the unions that destroyed this industry, it was the “Lima Declaration 1975” signed by Clyde Cameron of Labor Government with bipartisan support from the Liberal opposition.
@don_pittis I doubt we'll influence Asian countries. We have no smart leaders consistently. In a couple months, we'll be getting electric cars from them😲. Unions better start spouting realistic jobs and wages, current labor laws don't work.
Labor govern for UNIONS  👎😡
@SuperHotPeppers @MargMcCrohon @billshortenmp @urchinshell No, Holden closed because Joe Hockey dared them to closed. I heard him say it in Question Time in Parliament. That had nothing to do with Labor or the Unions. The LNP were in Government at the time. Holden had plans to make 3 more models and stay open until 2022. 😡
Yes, Labor will do what the unions did to our car Industry.😲
Probably non unions workers..😂🤦🏻‍♂️ well that’s whatcha get for using cheap unskilled labor https://t.co/U4yaWkx9NW
#HornetFamily in action! We're so proud that our campus labor unions organized a collection this morning in the Library Quad of some specific items that will help those impacted by the devastating Camp Fire. Thank you for caring, Hornets! 💚🐝 https://t.co/6GdYLAEs4R
@CassinStuart Indeed ... so Barrie’s now trying to imply the ‘unions’ need to be kept under control by Labor,if they want the win the next Federal election 🤔😐 The reason why #MSM were shocked about the result in Victoria;they have NFI about what is actually happening outside their bubble
@21WFMJ 😖 Welp at least now my hometown of Youngstown knows what they HAD TO LOSE by voting trump!
It wasn't enough for republicans to bust the labor Unions to hell, now your flucking jobs are following! 😡
It’s called priorities the Union way 🙄🙄 Unions within Labor's industrial Left faction want Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to commit to a referendum on an indigenous "voice" to parliament in the first term of a Labor government.
@CFMEU With @LiberalAus Leadership like this I hope Labor and the Unions whip the arse off the LNP at the upcoming NSW and Federal elections. 😂
👏
@Pappiness Tariffs.... you mean My Chevy is not American 😳  you mean when the Dems took my Money and bailed out GM the last time, it was a bad investment?  You mean the labor unions arent orchestrating a larger plan to control the political outlook for 2020 🤔
@Nestea0617 do you know any other labor unions? i need to find 3😭
WE must have another Great Pause  🚨

@scotswa1 @CBSNews @WCCO And btw, I get that you’re trying to bait/gotcha me w/ 13th (oh geez, I wonder why🙄), but here’s the catch: that too has legally defined limitations. Penal labor is OK, for example. Also per courts, military draft and discrimination against black unions weren’t covered. OK?
@LibbyMettam @MikeNahan Labor are economically incompetent &amp; controlled by Unions - we all know this - don't blame me I voted Liberal👍
@sheikhabud lmbo 💀 I just think it's a bit of a 70s-80s throwback to start thinking about mass migration as a way to decimate working class wages, destroy unions or create a labor underclass; globalization did that, what capital wants is for these people to stay put or perish
