@CalgaryET The idiot thinks he's the brainiest person that ever lived, but he's thick as shit, the idiot is doing his best on climate change 😂😂 he has totally done the opposite opting out of the Paris climate agreement then opening the coal mines, can't be global warming it's too cold😂😂 https://t.co/spPA4KVuZU
@Suzannesopinion @CNN No, alone we can’t. But we wouldn’t be alone. Plenty of countries are willing to work together to combat this, &amp; what do we do? Pull out of the Paris climate agreement and focus on dimming the sun. 🙄😱😡🤬
@unseen1_unseen After withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, a glass dome would be better, so that all the climate gases stays in there and don't pollute the rest of the planet. 🤣😂
Could not help notice that when asked about wild divergent weather in QLD and NSW and climate change @mattjcan disingenuously said he believes it and muttered ‘Paris agreement’ and...wait for it...supports clean FOSSIL FUELS. Of course no follow up from Fran 😒 #rnbreakfast

💃Paris Climate Agreement.
Immigration rate reform -✔
UN Global Compact for Migration Cancelled -✔
Omg.  This is scary. It’s not funny anymore. The leader of the free world has no clue what climate change is. Pulled out of Paris Agreement without an understanding of what it is. 😨 https://t.co/62trxfJQp8
@DenimVera @SkyNewsAust @JanainOz @AdamBandt @ScottMorrisonMP Climate has changed for centuries . The current Paris agreement is shit . Does not curb emissions . Stops Oz from burning coal , gas etc but allows us to export it to other countries to burn it and continue the emissions . How the hell does that help 🙄🙄🙄
@sianberry @metoffice @michaelgove End fracking you idiot , Gove !! Clue - renewables investment ramp up as member of Paris Climate Agreement 💚💙🌞
@realDonaldTrump After his tweets over the last couple of days, this tweet takes the cake.  It’s not funny anymore. It is very, very scary that this man is leader of the free world pulled out of the Paris Agreement without knowledge of climate change. A pre schooler knows more about it. 😱😨😰😥
Also, reminder that even if his supporters in the U S  buy that, the rest of the world, which still belongs to Paris Climate Agreement, doesn’t. #lrt 🙄
@AlexSteffen Who pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement? This guy 😢 https://t.co/O7Tk18XTuz

@ShopSmartResist @realDonaldTrump @oaktownca51 You probably supported the Paris climate agreement. 🤦‍♂️
@CMAGracias He's fantastic, isn't he? Waters was involved in one of the early petitions which led to the Paris Climate Change Agreement back in 2015. A superb advocate for some great causes. 💚🌍💚
@Thomas1774Paine @drtimber But it can all be reversed if we just follow the globalist remedy for climate change &amp; sign on to the Paris climate agreement. Sorry Kerry just a little too transparent. 🖕🏽
UN environment chief resigns over excessive travel expenses - Axios This was one of the reasons ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ our Great 👍 ⁦@POTUS⁩ wanted out of The Paris climate agreement its a money-making scheme #TWGRP #AmericaFirst #KeepAmericaGreat  https://t.co/XUJmStYnoD

'Every Friday, I miss classes to sit outside my country’s parliament. I will continue to do so until leaders come into line with the Paris agreement' - 👏 inspirational action taken by Greta Thunberg in Sweden:
@Hughgassole1 @existentialfish Did she really say the climate has changed since we left the Paris agreement? 😂😂😂 as if us leaving made the weather change.
@WelshFelix @ReginaStultz @RedHourBen @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC Climate change... what a joke 😂as you make your huge carbon footprint 👣 ... glad we dumped that Paris Agreement

Why it's time we all became climate change optimists 🌺🌿
The man who pulled us out of the Paris Agreement doesn’t understand how climate change works 🤦🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/syXuxqK0H8
@2wallyworld @Jackof17 @perfectsliders @NatalieOlivier2 @prageru You can thank the EPA for that my friend 😊
I'm honored to inform you that I will be the speaker at the UN Climate Summit on 4th of December 🤗
@RepAdamSchiff   Climate change existed LONG before President Trump came along. Why didn’t Obama do anything to “fix” it? Sending $$ to the  Paris Agreement supporters is NOT being proactive. #TwelveDays 🤣 https://t.co/35MzCgTPCg

@H2Odio_ @MarinaSilva Sabe o que é curioso? O Trump prometeu sair do acordo de Paris mas os EUA só podem sair do acordo em 2020, depois das eleições presidenciais norte americanas 🤣🤣🤣

@Tweets4DJT That's exactly why Europe did not want us getting out of the Paris climate agreement because it was just giving them billions of dollars for nothing. You can't tax us anymore Europe, now you have to over tax your own people and look how that turns out.😁
But China ratified Paris Agreement whereas TRUMP withdrew us from it! 🤦🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/D9c8PvhA9z
paris climate agreement, wen't the wrong way but wen is the dead line, that they are not even close, never ever will be, and then add this dead line.. no future, future, such a hard choice, such an easy solution, that most don't care, no money to be made, to much work.. 🤦‍♂️😅🤨😜
Let's just put this tidbit out there shall we 🤦🏻‍♂️
@SerMM91 You ARE a right wing nut job. Besides, who exactly would be pulling out of the G20, just like he exited the JCPOA or like he exited the Paris Climate Agreement? Yet, the premise of your argument defends him. He's a clear and present danger. Have several seats right winger! 🤦🏾‍♂️
-Trump is in westwoods head ✔
-Trump is an idiot ✔
-Obamas administration didnt improve climate change ✔
-Paris agreement is to save face✔ (which I actually read 2 years ago, have you)
@DavidPiercy1975 @nypost Also there is a consensus - just about every country in the world signed an agreement last year that proves it. It’s called the Paris climate agreement. Look it up. STUPID AMERICAN!! 🤣🤣🤣
