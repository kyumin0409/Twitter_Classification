@ColinWallace4 @JonOlsonVoteGOP @SenSchumer Another unnecessary bit of name-calling.  On the positive side, I’m glad you agree that Roberts’ vote proves that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional. 😀
@LizzieClarke00 @nenasullins @realDonaldTrump They hate Obamacare, but they’re huge fans of the affordable care act 🤦🏻‍♀️
Gov.Brown carved out $2M in her proposed 2019-21 budget for suing the Trump Administration.Whether it’s over a travel ban, attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act or sanctuary policies. The federal government has become an affront to Oregon values 🙄https://t.co/UOTULjuVUx

@ResisterSis20 ❤️ Obama as all the Republicans ran midterm campaigns promising to protect the pre-existing conditions protection he wrote into his law.  The Affordable Care Act. ❤️
Wow. Utah, one of the reddest states votes to curb gerrymandering by approving independent redistricting, expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act AND to legalize medical marijuana. The times are a changing. ✌️ https://t.co/zXASGZ3V3r
@DasCarrot Shit I've been paying mine for years 😭 LOL. With the Affordable Care Act you need it or you'll pay a fine ($695) when you do your taxes. Up to you, but as someone who works in healthcare, if something happened you'd be totally screwed financially

@PAyers19 @josephfoley2ooo @PismoBeachMan @RFaltisek @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenSchumer He's like the hacks that didn't know that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same damn thing.  Although I love the vids of people saying they support ACA but not Obamacare 😂
