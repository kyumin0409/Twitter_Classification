That’s why I was happy to be here today for the ribbon cutting at this new affordable housing option for seniors in Melbourne. It’s a step in the right direction, and very much needed in this community.
*****************************
Without meaningful support for affordable housing at all levels of government, we risk condemning a whole lot of Americans and Floridians to a life of distress and despair.
*****************************
Over the years, the state government in Florida has siphoned money away from trust funds designed to increase the supply of affordable housing—using that that money instead for other purposes. That’s shortsighted and it hurts hardworking Floridians.
*****************************
Now, Florida is experiencing an influx of people coming from Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria, inflaming an already troubled affordable housing problem — a problem compounded by mistakes made at the state level.
*****************************
In Florida, around 7 in 10 of low-income renters pay more than 40% of their income to rent. To make matters worse, the growth of low-income renters in Florida has far outpaced the creation of new affordable housing units. https://t.co/Tar2W5Y3pO
*****************************
The less affordable housing gets, the more unstable our communities become. In fact, studies show unstable housing conditions lead to health risks, higher rates of crime, poor academic performance, psychological costs, and the loss of community.
*****************************
For too long, affordable housing has been treated like a luxury, rather than a basic need. When folks can’t afford to stay in their home, they’re forced to choose between food, medicine, and a roof over their head. No one in Florida should have to make that kind of choice.
*****************************

Each and every veteran here today has done their part to serve our country, and I’m going to make sure our country does its part to serve them.

*****************************
That’s why, together with @SenJackReed, we’ve introduced legislation to require the @DeptofDefense to provide the full details of any and all chemical and biological tests that our soldiers may have been exposed to while serving abroad, including in areas such as Vietnam.

These brave warriors put their lives on the line to defend our country. And I believe we, as a nation, have a responsibility to provide them the very best care when they return home.

*****************************
The spending package also includes a $60 million increase in funding for state grants to help babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome get the care they need.
*****************************
Glad we were able to pass the spending package in Congress last week, which includes $3.3 billion in increased funding to fight the opioid epidemic and the mental health crises our country faces.
*****************************
In 2016, for every 1,000 babies born in Florida, 18 are born dependent on opioids. This is an increase over the previous year, where for every 1,000 newborns, 11 are born suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.

*****************************
I’m hopeful we can continue to work together on a universal background check requirement for anyone who wants to buy a gun and find a way to get these assault weapons and high-capacity magazines off our streets.
*****************************
We’ve shown how we can get things done to prevent gun violence – if we just work together. The fight doesn’t stop here – we need to do more if we really want to reduce the gun violence problem in our country.
*****************************
This includes the Fix NICS Act, which strengthens our background check system, the STOP School Violence Act, which funds programs to help keep our schools safe, and finally we can let @CDCgov do the necessary research on gun violence.
*****************************
With this spending bill, we’re moving a little closer to turning the voices of the students marching across the country into action. While we still have so much work to do, I am happy to see some movement on bipartisan legislation to help address gun violence in our country.

Just learned that funding for another Hurricane Hunter jet is in the $1.3 trillion spending bill Congress will vote on this week. I've been relentless on this because 20 million Floridians are in the potential path of a hurricane &amp; data from this aircraft saves lives &amp; property.

The Senate just passed legislation to crack down on online sex trafficking. An untold number of women and children in Florida and across the U.S. are being sold into sexual slavery via the internet. It’s unacceptable and wrong. We can't sit by idly any longer. https://t.co/Cs46Z5t3lz

More evidence that Russia is propping up Maduro and his cronies while the Venezuelan people suffer. We must show Putin and Maduro that we will not tolerate this behavior. https://t.co/95JsYCuY6i

Met with @HispanicFed this afternoon, six months to the day after Hurricane Maria tore a path of destruction across Puerto Rico. It is totally unacceptable that more than 100,000 people are still without electricity. They're our fellow American citizens! https://t.co/1U9o45OOl5
*****************************
Mr. Brangman’s presence at today’s hearing is a stark reminder of the human cost of these defective airbags and a reminder to everyone – especially @NHTSAgov — that we need to pick up the pace on these recalls before anyone else loses a loved one. https://t.co/bdkjd50W4U
*****************************
In 2014, we held our first hearing on defective Takata airbags, and more than three years later, there are still too many of these deadly airbags on our roads. We need to get these recalls moving, lives are at stake.
*****************************
FEMA is too slow in Puerto Rico. And if you did not have electricity 6 months after the storm, you'd be upset. https://t.co/iYz7KI7QxK
*****************************
Nearly 6 months after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, lives are on the line as more than hundred thousand people are still without electricity. As hurricane season approaches, our fellow American citizens desperately need help. https://t.co/kKlG2Ci54t

The first #StPatricksDay was not in Boston in 1737, nor was the first St. Patrick's Day parade in New York in 1762.

*****************************
This week I asked my colleagues to take up legislation immediately to treat gun violence as the public health crisis that it is and fund the necessary research at the CDC. Gun violence is hurting our communities -- we need to take meaningful action and this is an important step. https://t.co/dx3hOqSiI7

It’s becoming clear that no one really knows what offshore drilling deal Secretary Zinke cut with the governor of Florida, including Zinke himself. More and more, it’s beginning to sound like no deal really exists and, as feared, it’s all one big political sleight of hand. https://t.co/tQybDsLoke

Why did it take the Trump administration so long to impose any sanctions at all on Russia? Eight months ago, Congress passed legislation to impose sanctions by an overwhelming vote. This should have been done months ago and we still have work to do to hold Putin accountable. https://t.co/eaa3JY25EV

Fact: Global surface temperatures are rising. https://t.co/7kZHVgNDBk
*****************************
Facts are facts, and they’re not up for debate. Here are some climate facts that we just can’t ignore:
*****************************
.@NASA recently released climate data showing that 2017 was the second-hottest year on record after 2016, and now 17 of the 18 warmest years since record keeping began have occurred since 2001. https://t.co/rtJdzq5Bjy https://t.co/EKwHNw8LdP
*****************************
Climate change also threatens our national security. The Dept. of National Intelligence's new Worldwide Threat Assessment states that climate change and threats to our environment are "likely to fuel economic and social discontent -and possibly upheaval." https://t.co/UCGpLNXcgv
*****************************
A new report is also sounding the alarm that sea turtles are already feeling the effects of climate change. Almost all sea turtles being born now are female.
https://t.co/lx4r388KK6
*****************************
While some want to deny the reality of climate change, or that it is some far off problem for future generations to address, doctors in Florida are sounding the alarm to the public health risk it is posing today, right now. https://t.co/72eEhbDqzb
*****************************
Climate change is real, and we must take action to protect ourselves. Denial of this scientific reality is simply not an option, especially in Florida.
*****************************
From the rising seas that flood our cities, to bleached coral and more frequent and ferocious hurricanes, we must take action to combat climate change now. The longer we put it off, the harder it will be to protect ourselves. https://t.co/FCMAF6mcUN
*****************************
Just joined @SenWhitehouse and a group of my colleagues on the Senate floor to urge action to combat climate change. We can't sleep on this issue, it's #TimeToWakeUp to the threats of climate change.
*****************************
Is Florida on or off the table when it comes to offshore drilling? Depends on the day, it seems. Sec. Zinke just admitted in front of a Senate committee that Florida is "still in the process," confirming his previous announcement was a political stunt. https://t.co/8kKDvq7m68 https://t.co/M3tESIJFHu
*****************************
There is chaos in the Trump administration’s Department of State. Now Secretary Tillerson is gone, and an undersecretary just got fired. It's time to clamp down and become professional in our foreign relations. https://t.co/c0JHyVcScI
*****************************
There are many pieces of bipartisan legislation I’m supporting as first steps, but none have come to a vote. We need to get something done. And if we’re serious about stopping gun violence, we need to get assault rifles off our streets and require universal background checks. https://t.co/oQn3u6PRUR
*****************************
Arming teachers is a terrible idea. It’s not what the students want, it’s not what the teachers want, it’s not what law enforcement wants, and it’s not what the American people want. https://t.co/wnxlMI021y
*****************************
Great meeting with the Florida delegation of @JDRF today. These bright kids caught me up to speed on the technological breakthroughs being made in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, like the artificial pancreas. We must continue funding these programs, so we can find a cure. https://t.co/eYAqgu1VSX

Just sent a letter to Sec. Mnuchin to ask what steps @USTreasury is taking to ensure that the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela, which is responsible for numerous human rights violations, cannot undermine sanctions through the use of cryptocurrencies. https://t.co/0TupFjqRxf
*****************************
The answer to protecting our kids and communities is not more guns in our schools or arming teachers. That's a terrible idea. We should be focused on expanding background checks and getting these military-style assault rifles off the streets.
*****************************
Florida’s waterways should stay clean and clear of toxic chemicals. That’s why @RepTedDeutch and I asked the EPA to make sure there’s public input. And they need to take public health into account, especially for our children and seniors. https://t.co/aoGJvZYBrM

*****************************
FEMA is currently providing shelter to more than a thousand families in Florida who fled their homes after Hurricane Irma. This program expires in just a few days, and I hope the state of Florida and FEMA work together on an extension so these families can get the help they need.

Citrus growers in Florida are hurting after their groves were devastated by Hurricane Irma, and the disaster assistance they need has yet to arrive. Talked with Sec. Perdue at USDA about speeding up this process, and he said help will arrive within weeks, not months.

What happened in Parkland must never happen again and this bill, like many other bipartisan proposals I’ve supported, is a commonsense measure that helps advance the conversation and congressional efforts around school safety and comprehensive gun reform. https://t.co/4MgBx6BToT

It's been nearly six months since Hurricane Irma hit Florida, and almost a month after Congress passed the disaster funding to help Florida's fisheries, citrus growers and communities across the state.

*****************************
Just called Commerce Sec. Ross and urged him to help get the NOAA disaster funding provided by Congress to areas of Florida still recovering from Hurricane Irma. Our fishermen need help, and debris still litters the canals and is threatening to damage coral. https://t.co/xWqTb3y0LO

*****************************
Great talking with @JoeNBC this morning on @Morning_Joe about what we need to do to enact commonsense measures to combat this epidemic of gun violence. In order to solve this problem, we’ve got to bring people together – not divide people. https://t.co/KtYEm4xwxE

Vladimir Putin is no friend of the United States. He's an old soviet-style KGB officer who is trying to use this video as an intimidation tactic. And until the Trump administration starts cracking down on Russia, Putin is going to keep getting away with this. https://t.co/JBKCUO4iMG
*****************************
Arming teachers is NOT the answer. https://t.co/2bZq7kJNn3
*****************************
Massacres like this shouldn't happen in a school, in a nightclub, in a church, or at a concert. It shouldn't happen at all. So, why does it? Our refusal to act. We can’t let what happened fade into a memory like so many other tragedies. Let's do the right thing and take action. https://t.co/Ss4KEXmDI4
*****************************
Thinking of everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas as they return to school today. Your courage and determination in wake of this tragedy has been tremendous; and we are all with you as you return to class today. #NeverAgain

*****************************
Powerful words from one of the doctors who treated some of the victims of the Parkland school shooting on why we need to get these military-style assault rifles off our streets. https://t.co/m1ZeGkHdr5
*****************************
Instead of listening to students &amp; parents, Gov. Scott’s plan bows to the NRA’s demands. It does not expand criminal background checks or ban assault rifles, such as the AR-15. Raising the age to 21 is the bare minimum. We need to get these assault rifles off our streets.
*****************************
This is a win-win-win. It’s good for UCF and Florida, it’s good for Puerto Rico, and it will enable thousands of scientists who do research at Arecibo each year to continue their work. https://t.co/gOK5WsQUij
*****************************
No one should have to go through what these high school students are going through. Common sense says we should get these assault rifles off of our streets and have criminal background checks in acquiring guns.
*****************************
I grew up on a ranch. I've always had guns and I've hunted all my life. An AR-15 is not for hunting; it's for killing. https://t.co/acbhJp4t5S

*****************************
Let's just not talk about it. Let's do something about it. Let's make what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school a pivotal moment in this country's history, not because it was one of the largest mass shootings — but hopefully because it was the last. https://t.co/5Xv4dXbNV4
*****************************
If now is not the time to talk about gun violence, when is the time? How many more folks have to die? Let's have a conversation about this right now - not just about mental illness or protecting our schools - let's get to the root cause and get assault weapons off our streets. https://t.co/NIQt0oQtEH
*****************************
At some point we've got to say enough is enough. At some point we as a society have got to come together and put a stop to this. I’m a hunter, I’ve owned guns all my life. An AR-15 is not for hunting. It's for killing. Let’s get these assault weapons off our streets. https://t.co/ck6svgSmtN
*****************************
Sandy Hook, Pulse nightclub, Ft. Lauderdale airport, Las Vegas and now Parkland, Florida - when is this going to stop? It’s not going to stop until the American people say: enough is enough! What is it going to take for enough to be enough? https://t.co/SVJzvlJzsR

Our worst fears are being realized. It looks like it’s a number of fatalities. Praying for all those students, families and school members affected at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

*****************************
The Trump administration now wants Floridians to pay $200M to speed up work on the Lake O dike. That’s absurd. Congress just gave the Army Corps all the money it needs to fully fund this project and get it done by 2022. https://t.co/PjwTHFm3ke

Senate just approved $90 billion in disaster assistance to help people in Florida and Puerto Rico recover from last year’s hurricanes. This is a big win for all those who are still struggling to recover from these devastating storms. https://t.co/vMDWmd3G55
*****************************
We got $6 billion included in this budget deal to help combat the opioid crisis. 5,200 people died in Florida in 2016 because of opioids, a 35% increase from the year before. This funding couldn't come at more urgent time.
*****************************
I'm happy to say that we finally have a path forward to provide the people of Florida and Puerto Rico with some much needed disaster relief after last year’s storms. I took to the Senate floor earlier to urge my colleagues to pass this bill immediately. https://t.co/GpqwDhzwNj
*****************************
Senate leaders have agreed to close Medicare's "donut hole" by 2019 as part of the budget deal. Closing this coverage gap will save seniors thousands of dollars every year on their Rx drugs. It also saves taxpayers about $9 billion over ten years. That's a win-win for everyone.
*****************************
We got several important things included in this budget deal including $2.3 billion to help FL’s ag &amp; citrus growers, $2.7 billion to help our schools, $2 billion to rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid and $15 billion for Army Corps to use for things such as the Lake O dike.

Russian attempts to influence our elections are attacks on the very foundation of our Democracy. This is not a partisan issue. It can happen to both sides.

Today’s test launch of the #FalconHeavy is a spectacular demonstration of the comeback of Florida’s Space Coast, which is succeeding in a big way. It’s good news for our space program. It's good news for national security. And it's great news for jobs and the economy. https://t.co/NiBgfWcybE

*****************************
I'm calling on Senate leaders to include disaster assistance for Florida in the spending bill.

The Senate just sent a bill to the president requiring amateur athletic governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics, to immediately report sexual abuse.

This is a win for bipartisanship. For days, I've been working with a group of moderate senators to end the shutdown &amp; get a commitment to take up other bills. As a result, there is now a path forward to help Dreamers, fund the military and provide disaster assistance to Florida.

This is a serious situation, not a time for partisan politics. I am in the Capitol right now working hard to bring people together to reach a bipartisan consensus.

Sen. Ron Wyden and I were in Miami and Tampa today to talk with local business leaders about the GOP’s tax plan. We need a tax code that’s fair and works for everyone, including small business owners and hardworking families. This GOP plan does the opposite. https://t.co/oqeRKsA01m

I met with Kirstjen Nielsen, nominee to be next DHS secretary, this morning and urged her to extend Temporary Protected Status for the 60k Haitians already here in the U.S., instead of sending them back to a country that can’t support them. https://t.co/7IrHoofxd7

Here we are, working on a tax bill that will inevitably touch every single American in some way, shape, or form.
