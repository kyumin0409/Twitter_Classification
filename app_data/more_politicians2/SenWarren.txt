The VA is supposed to serve the healthcare needs of America's veterans – not the business interests of @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies. I've already gotten an independent gov’t watchdog to investigate, and I’ll keep pushing the @VetAffairsOIG to fully address this scandal. https://t.co/PI3ZV7ytHV
*****************************
Kathy Kraninger has no interest in fighting for American families &amp; zero experience standing up for consumers. The @SenateGOP just voted to put her in charge of the @CFPB anyway.

Kraninger may be on the side of cheating companies – but I won't stop fighting for working families. https://t.co/cAgLIFxJJp
*****************************
US firms shouldn’t do the dirty work of repressive regimes and ruthless dictators. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. If other countries want to make their case, they can use their diplomats. https://t.co/6w2Ce2fAyV

Last week, I asked MSL Group and other US lobbying firms to explain their work representing the interests of Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. MSL responded that they’re continuing business as usual and still working for the Saudis. https://t.co/GoW1WoJkbD https://t.co/Bw5zw8CJBU
*****************************
Saudi Arabia used American lobbyists to rent hundreds of Trump hotel rooms and dupe veterans into secretly pushing the Saudis' agenda. Bribing @realDonaldTrump is unconstitutional – but tricking veterans into lobbying for Saudi Arabia is totally legal. It shouldn't be. https://t.co/hMYba3dCR1
*****************************
My plan to #EndCorruptionNow is the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate. @RepJayapal &amp; @RepSarbanes have now introduced it in the House. We're working together to make sure our government really represents the American people. https://t.co/cnHJji18EK
*****************************
We can't lose track of all of @WellsFargo’s scandals. Because on the end of every fake account or improper foreclosure is a person who suffers real harm. I'm still fighting to hold Wells Fargo and its executives accountable for the damage they've done. https://t.co/pEAEAhzjt2

*****************************
George H.W. Bush was an American patriot who lived his life and served our country with dignity. From joining the Navy during WWII to the presidency, his devotion to public service was unmatched. Bruce and I send our heartfelt condolences to his family.
*****************************
We can start by passing my bill with @MarkWarner to impose massive, mandatory penalties on companies like @Equifax that expose people's personal information. We can’t allow companies to get away with leaving sensitive data vulnerable to hackers and thieves.https://t.co/s95R4Do8x1
*****************************
CEOs won’t take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line. Instead of working to give giant companies like @Marriott even bigger handouts, Congress should focus on holding them accountable for these giant screw-ups. https://t.co/opDufhhLIT
*****************************
It’s time to #EndCorruptionNow. We can do it by passing my Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which was just introduced in the House by @RepJayapal. Together, we can make Washington start working for the American people again. https://t.co/6w2Ce2fAyV
*****************************
This is exactly why we should require candidates to release their tax returns when running for federal office, and prevent Presidents from owning business empires on the side. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would do both. https://t.co/IOnB9zehDl

*****************************
Working families need a @CFPB Director with a proven track record of fighting for consumers. Someone who is willing to go after companies that cheat them. Kathy Kraninger is not that person. I’m calling on my Senate colleagues to reject her nomination. https://t.co/ENHK7AX0OI
*****************************
Americans are an adaptive, resilient people, and we have met hard challenges head on before. We can work together, as we have before, to strengthen democracy at home and abroad. We can build a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just wealthy elites.
*****************************
55 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy spoke at @AmericanU, he said that, “our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man.” The same is true today. 

(OK, I’d add that they can also be solved by women, too.)
*****************************
The time for holding back is over. Patriots of every political persuasion must stand up to this type of behavior. Americans must demonstrate to @realdDonaldTrump and to the world that we are not sliding toward autocracy – not without a fight.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe. And he is aided and abetted every step of the way by Republican politicians too pleased with his judicial appointments and tax cuts to stand up for fundamental American values.
*****************************
Here’s the thing about authoritarian governments – they are rotten from the inside out. Authoritarian leaders talk a big game, but their system is rotten because, by its very design, it stacks the decks for the wealthy and depends on corruption in order to survive.
*****************************
It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds. We must speak plainly about all of these incidents. Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda &amp; ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with US values.
*****************************
We must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day. That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes, and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those – foreign or domestic – who meddle, hack, or undermine them.
*****************************
Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve national security. A 21st century industrial policy, for example, would produce good jobs that provide dignity, respect, and a living wage, and it would also reinforce US international economic power.
*****************************
A foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home. But every day, shortsighted domestic policies are weakening our national strength.
*****************************
Let me propose three core nuclear security principles: 
1. No new nuclear weapons. 
2. More international arms control, not less.
3. No first use.
*****************************
America should also be reinvesting in diplomacy. Foreign policy shouldn't be run exclusively by the Pentagon. Yes, we should expect our partners to pay their fair share. But diplomacy isn't about charity; it's about advancing US interests.
*****************************
It is time to identify which programs actually benefit American security in the 21st century, and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. Then pull out a sharp knife and make some cuts.
*****************************
The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table – but they shouldn’t get to own the table. US security and values should come ahead of the profit margins of private companies.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he's more interested in appeasing defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for murdering a @washingtonpost journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons.
*****************************
How do we responsibly cut back? We can start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy. It’s clear that the Pentagon is captured by defense contractors – and taxpayers are picking up the bill.
*****************************
Let’s cut our bloated defense budget. The US will spend more than $700 billion on defense this year alone. That is more than President Reagan spent during the Cold War. If more money for the Pentagon could solve our security challenges, we would have solved them by now.
*****************************
Let’s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week, including one who grew up in Boston, are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war. It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now.
*****************************
Yes, we can – and we we must – continue to be vigilant about the threats of terrorism, whether from Afghanistan or anywhere else. But rather than fighting in an Afghan civil war, let’s help them reach a realistic peace settlement that halts the violence and protects our security.
*****************************
For nearly 2 decades, this country has been mired in a series of wars – conflicts that sap American strength. The human costs of these wars has been staggering: more than 6,900 Americans killed, another 52k wounded. Many more who live every day with the invisible scars of war.
*****************************
All three of my brothers served in the military. I know that our servicemembers and their families are smart, tough, and resourceful. But a strong military should act as a deterrent so that most of the time, we won’t have to use it.
*****************************
Just last week, our own government said that climate change is already happening and will dramatically endanger the world we share. The threat is real and existential – and we need to take action, now.
*****************************
Our economic policies should also address the challenges of today’s interconnected world, including areas like corruption, privacy and data rights, and climate change.
*****************************
We need a new approach to trade, and it should begin with a simple principle: our policies should not prioritize corporate profits over American paychecks.  That should be true for NAFTA and true for every deal we cut.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump grabs headlines railing against @GM’s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio and Michigan – but his actual policies aren’t stopping them or other like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers. It’s time for real change.
*****************************
I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and I will vote against it in the Senate unless @realDonaldTrump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families.
*****************************
There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0.
*****************************
For decades, leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric – except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts – and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown.
*****************************
Our country is in a moment of crisis decades in the making. America’s middle class has been hollowed out, working people have been betrayed, and democracy itself is under threat. It’s time to create a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just the rich and powerful.
*****************************

*****************************
We currently spend more than the next 8 nations combined on defense. But every year, the Pentagon asks Congress for more. "More" is not a strategy. We need smarter investments in our security – and that includes refocusing on investments we should be making at home. https://t.co/RAVntalqSk

In March, DOD told me it didn't track what targets warplanes armed and refueled by the US hit in Yemen. I’m glad we've stopped refueling, but it’s too late to repair the damage those warplanes have caused. I cosponsored S.J. Res 54 to end this war. https://t.co/uhi4WKLD2H
*****************************
The ugly truth is that by continuing to enable Saudi Arabia, the US is complicit in the devastation in Yemen. S.J. Res 54 will help us hold our allies – and ourselves – accountable.

3 US servicemembers were killed in Afghanistan today.
 
As we grieve with their families, we must ask: how many more must die for us to realize that no amount of US military power will fix Afghanistan? We have been at war for 17 years. It’s time to bring our troops home. https://t.co/dnEVBbaHin
*****************************
The #GOPTaxScam has benefited shareholders &amp; CEOs, while American workers are being kicked to the curb. It's time to give workers at General Motors &amp; other big companies a stronger voice in corporate decisions. My Accountable Capitalism Act would do that: https://t.co/Chp7f0LJi3
*****************************
General Motors just announced plans to lay off nearly 15,000 workers and shut down plants across the US. This is the same @GM that got a huge tax break from the #GOPTaxScam and spent $4.5 billion on stock buybacks last year. It’s shameful. https://t.co/7C7W77PouW

If @realDonaldTrump was willing to go to such incredible lengths to hide how he really “made” his fortune – what’s stopping him now from bilking the presidency and American taxpayers for everything they’re worth?
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump was the 1st presidential candidate in 40 years not to make his tax returns public. Maybe because he got over $400M from his dad to start out &amp; probably committed tax fraud. @nytimes’ reporting is likely just the tip of the iceberg – what else is he hiding?

*****************************
Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting. So far, Brett Kavanaugh has refused over and over again to submit to one. He lied repeatedly while under oath. I don’t know when the full Senate will ultimately vote. But NOW is the time to make your voice heard.
*****************************
One way for Brett Kavanaugh to clear his name is to submit to an FBI investigation. But he refuses. And he won't release the thousands of documents from his gov't service. What is he hiding? A Justice should have honesty &amp; integrity. Kavanaugh has neither – he should withdraw.

Dr. Ford's testimony today is heartbreaking, credible, and compelling. Anyone watching can have no doubt she is telling the truth. I believe her, and I hope my Republican colleagues do too.

Many Puerto Ricans were forced to abandon their homes after #HurricaneMaria. Some ended up in MA – where 300k people have ties to the island. I intro’d a bill to force the Trump Admin to activate a program for displaced families, which @FEMA refuses to do. https://t.co/9wWtRdDpe0

Después de que Trump terminó de tirar toallas de papel, regresó a la Casa Blanca e ignoró las secuelas del #HurricaneMaria. Mientras tanto, he luchado para que los sobrevivientes reciban la ayuda federal que merecen. Aquí está todo en lo que he trabajado: https://t.co/XM3GW9giiv
*****************************
After @realDonaldTrump finished tossing out paper towels, he went back to the White House and ignored the aftermath of #HurricaneMaria. Meanwhile, I’ve been fighting to get survivors the federal help they deserve. Here’s everything I’ve been working on: https://t.co/goEDOeSDh7

En enero, viajé a Puerto Rico y vi de primera mano la devastación causada por el #HurricaneMaria. Vi a nuestros conciudadanos estadounidenses enfrentando desafíos increíbles: cables eléctricos caídos, agua que enfermaba a la gente, y niños sin hogar. https://t.co/QWyn8QNTyS

Hoy, hace un año, #HurricaneMaria devastó a Puerto Rico y a las Islas Vírgenes. La pésima respuesta del gobierno federal convirtió un desastre natural en una crisis humanitaria. Miles de ciudadanos estadounidenses murieron, y muchos siguen viviendo en condiciones difíciles. https://t.co/fmjK0puRlo

A year ago today, #HurricaneMaria devastated Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. The federal government's shoddy response turned a natural disaster into a full-on humanitarian crisis.

Brett Kavanaugh is up for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court. Dr. Ford – and the American people – deserve a full investigation. Republicans shouldn’t rush this. We need to take the time to get it right.

We can keep our country safe AND uphold our values by helping those fleeing violence and persecution. @realDonaldTrump's decision to drastically cut the number of refugees allowed into the US isn't just bad policy, it's a total failure of US moral leadership. #StandWithRefugees https://t.co/Zp77wWb74a
*****************************
Seriously? What good could an ex-lobbyist who represented pro-Russia groups possibly be doing at @HHSGov?

My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would slam the revolving door shut on lobbyists who try to waltz into gov't, &amp; ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments. https://t.co/wT9I99PYwo

Brett Kavanaugh talking about his high school in 2015: “What happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep.”

Low-wage workers are especially vulnerable to workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. It’s wrong, and it has to stop. I stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking today to protest sexual harassment on the job, and retaliation for reporting it. https://t.co/DktwRz7cSN

*****************************
The Climate Risk Disclosure Act will help investors determine climate-related risks, encourage markets to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, &amp; reduce the risks of an environmental and financial catastrophe – all without spending a dime of taxpayer money.
*****************************
Markets need to take the many complex risks posed by climate change into account. This isn’t a radical new idea – @algore proposed something similar years ago. It’s a concrete step we can take today. https://t.co/dG0xnFbskO
*****************************
On the other hand, if the global community follows through on commitments to limit global warming and move away from the use of fossil fuels, oil and gas companies could be worth a lot less.
*****************************
If climate change continues at this rate, sea levels will rise – putting companies with physical assets near shorelines at risk. More frequent superstorms will interfere with shipping. Longer droughts will result in higher food costs. That can all affect a company’s bottom line.
*****************************
My new Climate Risk Disclosure Act would force public companies to disclose critical information about how climate change could affect the value of their assets so that investors can make smart decisions with their money.
*****************************
Before the 2008 crash, investors and the government failed to address growing risks in our financial system. We’re making the same mistake with climate change today – we know it’s coming, but we’re not doing enough to stop it. I'm introducing major legislation to help fix that. https://t.co/O1mZhdYLVk

To all those impacted by Hurricane Florence – especially those who have lost loved ones – know we are with you. Recovery won’t be easy, but the outpouring of volunteers &amp; donations from across America are proof that you're not alone. We’re in this together.https://t.co/IVnYMcT7cg

*****************************
There were 3 gas explosions &amp; over 60 fires across 3 Merrimack Valley communities yesterday. The physical damage I saw in Lawrence was staggering.

10 years ago this week, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. It was a key turning point in a financial crisis that would ultimately cost 9 million people their jobs &amp; millions more their homes &amp; savings. Many working families are still struggling to recover what they lost.

*****************************
If we want credit reporting agencies to act responsibly with our data, we need to hold them accountable when they screw up. Under my bill with @MarkWarner, @Equifax would’ve paid at least $1.5 billion in fines. It’s been a year since the breach – Congress should pass it now. https://t.co/Th1xFZPoDO

When John McCain and I worked together, he’d say: “Show some fight. Get in there – throw some punches.” That was his approach to life – if you’re gonna be in a fight, you better give it your all. It was an honor to serve with him. A patriot, a maverick, a fighter to the end.

John McCain and I disagreed on many things, and sometimes quite forcefully. But even when we disagreed, I always respected that his heart was focused on doing what he thought was best for the American people.

John McCain was fiercely devoted to his family, his constituents, and his country. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time. As a nation, we all share in the sense of emptiness his passing has left behind.

*****************************
Americans know Washington isn’t working for them. But instead of giving up, more &amp; more people are demanding a government that is run by the people for the people – and I have a plan to do that. Here’s my speech outlining my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow:
https://t.co/IOnB9zehDl
*****************************
.@EricCantor, have you been listening? You spent so much time schmoozing with the rich and powerful that your constituents voted you out. Then you went to work for Wall Street. I’m shocked – SHOCKED – you don’t like my bill to #EndCorruptionNow. https://t.co/f7upTp3iCO
*****************************
Since introducing my bill to #EndCorruptionNow this AM: Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign crimes. Paul Manafort convicted on tax fraud. Rep. Duncan Hunter indicted for misuse of campaign funds. And these are just the guys who've been caught.
 
Time to clean up Washington.
*****************************
Today I introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill to clean up Washington. My reforms would make it flatly illegal for Americans to work as lobbyists for foreign governments. Congress should pass this law so we never see another snake like Paul Manafort again. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Paul Manafort lied about lobbying for a foreign government and got rich. And it's shocking that @realDonaldTrump's campaign mgr has been convicted of criminal tax fraud. But it's insane that ANYONE is allowed to take shady foreign cash to lobby our government. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
I plan to fight to pass as many of these reforms as possible. I believe we can break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over our government. I believe we can get democracy working again. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Inside Washington, some of these proposals will be very unpopular, even with my friends. Outside Washington, I expect that most people will see these ideas as no-brainers and be shocked they’re not already law. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Build a new anticorruption agency to make sure that all key federal officials – even powerful Senators and Presidents – file disclosures and get rid of conflicts. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Big Change Number Six – Hire a new independent sheriff to police corruption. There are dedicated public servants that enforce our ethics laws – but they have less authority than security guards at the mall. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Strengthen the code of conduct for all federal judges – no stock trading, no payments from corporations for attending events, no honoraria for giving speeches, no lavish getaways &amp; fancy hunting trips funded by billionaires. &amp; I mean all federal judges, including SCOTUS justices.
*****************************
Fifth Big Change – Restore faith that ordinary people can get a fair shake in our courts. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Prosecute companies that knowingly mislead government agencies. And stop the practice of companies paying for sham “studies” designed to derail the rulemaking process. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Fourth Big Change – End corporate capture of rulemaking. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
We should ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments – period. If foreign governments want to express their views, they can use their diplomats. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Start by fixing the Swiss cheese definition of a “lobbyist.”  Require everyone who gets paid to influence government to register. And bring that lobbying out into the sunlight. Make every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official a matter of public record.
*****************************
Third Big Change – End lobbying as we know it. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Presidents should not be able to own companies on the side. And we shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let the American people see their financial interests. That should be the law – not just for presidential candidates, but for every candidate for every federal office.
*****************************
Second Big Change – Stop self-dealing by public officials. If a person works for the government, then that person should serve the public. No making policy decisions to help yourself instead of taxpayers. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Ban elected and appointed officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave office. Not for 1 year.  Not for 2 years. For the rest of their lives. No special deals for millions and millions of dollars to the policymakers who will be in a position to pay back their old employers.
*****************************
First Big Change – Padlock the revolving door between big business and government. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
The problem is enormous – but we’ve dealt with enormous problems before. We just need some big reform ideas and a willingness to fight for real change. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
There’s no real question that the @realDonaldTrump era has given us the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes. But they are not the cause of the rot – they’re just the biggest, stinkiest example of it. #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
These reforms have one simple aim: to take power in Washington away from  the wealthy, the powerful, and the well-connected who have corrupted our  government and put power back in the hands of the American people.  #EndCorruptionNow
*****************************
Today, I’m introducing the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation proposed in Congress since Watergate. This is an aggressive set of reforms that would fundamentally change the way Washington does business. #EndCorruptionNow

The same day SCOTUS announced they’d hear #JanusvAFSCME, Justice Gorsuch was schmoozing with anti-union funders @ Trump Hotel. He later voted to strip public sector unions of the resources they need to support workers. Real impartial, huh?#EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/81snwfVMYk
*****************************
Wall Street fat cat turned Commerce Sec Wilbur Ross left $2 billion off his financial disclosure forms during his confirmation. Now @SecretaryRoss is under fire for possible insider trading &amp; violating criminal conflict of interest laws. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/VseYgZEtBR

Payday lenders don't just prey on the vulnerable and lobby @MickMulvaneyOMB. They've also been caught interfering in academic studies meant to convince lawmakers that payday loans aren’t harmful to consumers. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/L4kho2qWWs
*****************************
4 months after @FCC Commissioner Meredith Baker voted to approve a huge merger between Comcast and NBC, she resigned. And you'll absolutely never guess where she went to work next! (It was Comcast-NBC.) #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/NyB5jKFsbG
*****************************
It’s no wonder @realDonaldTrump's drug pricing plan does nothing to actually reduce drug prices. It was developed by a former Big Pharma lobbyist, and it’s being run by HHS @SecAzar, a former Big Pharma executive. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/i3EyVRl763

Corporations don't just lobby, they also produce “unbiased” “research” to sway lawmakers. One Brookings economist was forced to resign after authoring a study that attacked a consumer protection rule – &amp; was funded by a financial firm.#EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/GCBveZpSWi
*****************************
Lobbying isn’t just for Big Banks, Big Pharma, &amp; Big Oil anymore. Big Tech is in on the game too. Last year, @Amazon, @Apple, @Facebook, @Google and @Microsoft spent a combined $50 million lobbying Ds and Rs in the government. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/5eyCYN2w3V

Jared Kushner refused to divest from his holdings in Kushner Companies. Then he sucked up to executives from a big bank &amp; investment company with personal White House visits. In return, they gave his family business $509 million in loans. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/bD7zgZNCyv
*****************************
How much is it worth to a bank to send its people into gov't? At least $232M. That’s how much the #GOPTaxScam handed to @GoldmanSachs in the 1st quarter after it passed – and former exec/Trump adviser Gary Cohn helped sell it to Congress. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/E6QDXBPSmm
*****************************
.@GoldmanSachs might as well change its name to “Government” Sachs. The bank has sent high-level execs (who leave with multi-million dollar gifts) into just about every D and R administration since FDR. And it keeps paying dividends. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/kcw3Oe2WIE

*****************************
Congress isn’t the only branch for sale. Justice Clarence Thomas attended a fancy Koch Brothers retreat, paid for by right-wing lawyers – &amp; accidentally “omitted” his wife’s work as a lobbyist on his financial disclosures... for 6 years. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/3I09AqM66w
*****************************
When former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his seat, he went straight to Wall Street for a $3.4 million salary. Pretty sure he wasn't hired for his investment banker chops (because he has none). They wanted access and influence. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/XRoxDGV95W
*****************************
Tom Price was later forced to resign from @HHSGov – after spending close to $1 million of taxpayer money on flights. (Oh, and another Congressman was just indicted for insider trading over the stock for that same company.) #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/D8qzE0gwlU
*****************************
Former HHS Secretary Tom Price brazenly traded health care stock while in Congress, &amp; misrepresented the value of his stocks on financial disclosures.

Corporations are making record profits &amp; top execs are cashing in huge bonuses – but workers’ wages are flat. That's because too many companies shovel out cash to wealthy shareholders and ignore the big picture. I’ve got a bold new plan to change that. https://t.co/orM2htlV0V

*****************************
For decades, big companies have made record profits while wages for working families haven’t budged. It didn’t use to be this way. We built America's middle class after WWII. We can get back to the time when American companies &amp; workers did well together. https://t.co/fLbEc53XPo
*****************************
.@KCCorp will dole out $700-900 million in stock buybacks to help shareholders &amp; executives while cutting up to 5,500 jobs. @Kroger is closing 14 stores &amp; laying off more than 1,600 people while rewarding its corporate execs &amp; shareholders with $1.2 billion in stock buybacks.
*****************************
Let’s look at some individual companies: @WellsFargo got a $3.4 billion boost from the #GOPTaxScam. It turned around and announced plans to close 900 branches, while rewarding executives and shareholders with tens of billions of dollars in stock buybacks.
*****************************
The #GOPTaxScam showered more than a trillion dollars on big American  corporations – a huge windfall for wealthy shareholders and executives.  But workers have seen their real wages go DOWN.  https://t.co/cVBklQimiW

*****************************
The Trump Admin has decided that banks aren't part of the “financial services” industry, &amp; that they should get an additional $2.5 billion in tax giveaways under the #GOPTaxScam. There’s no limit to what @realDonaldTrump will do to reward his rich buddies. https://t.co/PpmW6cXSpA

*****************************
Shady #4profit colleges scam students out of their futures, &amp; @BetsyDeVosED is their biggest accomplice.

After I asked @CommerceGov about their decision to grant tariff exemptions worth millions to a sanctioned Russian company, they suddenly reversed it. Begging the question – is @realDonaldTrump trying to help the US aluminum industry, or his pal Putin? https://t.co/5BqKu7siPh
*****************************
My office found that Rusal America Corp – a subsidiary of a sanctioned company controlled by a Russian oligarch &amp; Putin ally – got an exemption from @realDonaldTrump’s aluminum tariffs days after he met with Putin in Helsinki. I asked the Trump Admin why. https://t.co/l5Y8hTWlCp

*****************************
Because of an error @WellsFargo made, 400 of its customers lost their homes. What’s the bank doing to make it right? Setting aside a few thousand dollars for each of the people affected. Pathetic. The execs who oversaw this – including CEO Tim Sloan – should be fired. https://t.co/dqlp3Py6IS
*****************************
The Trump Admin's new tax form fits on a postcard –&amp; still requires 6 additional forms. It won’t save you time or money. To make Tax Day easier &amp; cheaper, Congress should pass my bill to let millions of Americans simply sign &amp; return a pre-filled tax form. https://t.co/nuBw0AQ45B

*****************************
A federal judge just forced @fema to extend shelter to Puerto Rican evacuees until August 31. That’s great for many families across MA– but now FEMA must help them find long-term solutions. If they don’t, we should pass my bill to force FEMA to do its job. https://t.co/ympO5cgpI8

Kathy Kraninger helped implement a policy to punish innocent young children – that is a moral stain that will follow her for the rest of her life. And that stain will follow any Senator who votes to give her a big promotion.
*****************************
Many kids are still separated and some of the kids who have been reunified aren't the same. One 5-year old boy asked his mom to breast feed him even though she hadn't nursed him in years. That's the legacy of the policy Kraninger helped carry out. https://t.co/rkCwhkRPc9

*****************************
The Banking Cmte might vote tmrw on Kathy Kraninger’s nomination to head @CFPB.

Trump wants to put Brett Kavanaugh on the SCOTUS –but he can’t do it without a Senate majority. It’s time to fight: https://t.co/g0uNy6x2ow
*****************************
Brett Kavanaugh's record as a judge and lawyer is clear: hostile to health care for millions, opposed to the CFPB &amp; corporate accountability, thinks Presidents like Trump are above the law – and conservatives are confident that he would overturn Roe v. Wade. I'll be voting no.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump, we need real policies to prevent drug companies from jacking up costs – like letting Medicare negotiate prices. You supported that during your campaign, then abandoned it after Big Pharma objected. Prescription drugs are too expensive, and your talk is cheap. https://t.co/kxPtfQ01AK
*****************************
Every single judge on @realDonaldTrump’s short list for the Supreme Court has been pre-approved by right-wing extremists.

Andrew Wheeler may not have the same stink of blatant corruption as @EPAScottPruitt – but he’s just as dirty. The @EPA's new Acting Director is a former coal lobbyist who will work to poison the agency – and the environment he’s supposed to protect – from the inside. https://t.co/Rh9kASui7q
*****************************
It looks like 29 was the magic number. @EPAScottPruitt has finally resigned. The American people deserve a new EPA chief who’s focused on protecting our environment, instead of someone intent on doing the bidding of Big Oil donors while wasting taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/bqoKrMVhuc
*****************************

*****************************
The Supreme Court – thanks to a seat stolen by right-wing Republicans – just upheld Trump’s Muslim ban. While the Court ruled it’s legal, the American people still know it isn’t right. And together, we'll keep fighting against religious discrimination, xenophobia, &amp; hate. (2/2)
*****************************
Last year, I joined hundreds of people at Logan Airport to protest @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban. We believed that the courts would ultimately overturn it – because it didn’t make us any safer, and it clearly violated America’s core values. We were wrong. (1/2) https://t.co/E0NigZxunc
*****************************
I believe that when a woman flees the only home she's ever known with her 4-year-old son and begs the United States of America for asylum, she deserves a fair hearing. I believe that every human being has worth. We must do better.
*****************************
I spoke with one woman from El Salvador at a CBP processing center. She  gave a policeman a drink of water, and the gangs came after her. She sold everything she had and fled with her 4-year-old son because their lives were in danger.

*****************************
.@realdonaldtrump could pick up the phone and stop the separation of families seeking refuge in the US. Instead, he continues to hold thousands of kids hostage to try and get Congress to pay for his stupid wall. This is his policy, and he can stop it. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pDw4eoFK8n

*****************************
Harry from Hull, MA told the @CFPB about his son’s shady auto-loan. The agency looked into his complaint &amp; forced those companies to refund $6.5 million to over 50k active-duty servicemembers. Harry came to the hearing today because he wants the @CFPB to keep helping people.
*****************************
One of those people is Ari. Before he deployed to Iraq, he bought a truck and got pushed into a subprime auto-loan scam that cost him more than 60% of his monthly paycheck. His dad Harry contacted the @CFPB on his behalf while he was deployed.
*****************************
I just finished questioning @MickMulvaneyOMB in a Senate hearing. Before he started running the @CFPB, he tried to kill it repeatedly. If he’d gotten his wish, billions of dollars would still be sitting at the companies that cheated customers – instead of the people they cheated.

Just like HIV/AIDS, we should ensure that every single American who needs addiction treatment and support gets it, without delay. That’s how we end the opioid crisis – not with speeches, but with treatment.

Our proposal isn't about public declarations and empty words. Just like HIV/AIDS, we need to provide communities that are battling the opioid epidemic every day with the funding and tools they so desperately need.
*****************************
The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how America treats HIV/AIDS. Congress must show the same political courage on opioids that our colleagues showed 30 years ago. @RepCummings and I propose a parallel approach for opioids – investing in research &amp; in treatment at the local level.
*****************************
Thanks to the Ryan White CARE Act, over half a million people a year with HIV/AIDS receive vital services. The epidemic isn’t over – but now life-saving medications are available, new infections have plummeted, and science – rather than stigma – guides medical care.
*****************************
In 1990, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass the bipartisan Ryan White CARE Act – named in honor of a teen from Indiana who was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. The law transformed our approach to treatment and provided significant new funding.

I visited Hie Shrine in Tokyo, a traditional Shinto shrine, where I learned more about Japanese religious culture. And with the cherry blossoms in full bloom, the city is beautiful. I've had a wonderful time and was honored to be back in Japan for the first time in many years. https://t.co/ceuJWPUONY
*****************************
The men &amp; women at US Embassy Tokyo are extraordinary. Our Foreign Service Officers are the face of the US to foreign governments and people all over the world. I was glad to meet with them, and the Marine Security Guards who protect them, to thank them for their service. https://t.co/6Vg4mdN3DP
*****************************
Sullivans Elementary on Yokosuka Naval Base is the largest school in the DOD system. I met their principal, support staff, &amp; even got to stop at a classroom to giggle &amp; make funny faces. When our service members live abroad, they and their families make tremendous sacrifices. https://t.co/xc7Ex60Nhe
*****************************
I had a meaningful visit to the USS Ronald Reagan and met its crew, who proudly represent the United States in the Pacific. We had lunch in the mess and discussed how Congress can better assist our sailors and their families. https://t.co/xUWeIEXmBk
*****************************
I've spent the last few days in Japan, meeting with Japanese government officials, and our US military and State Department officials. Our strong US-Japan alliance is critical to regional security, and our commitment to Japan's defense is ironclad. https://t.co/eW98gAS4hY

UPDATE: The @NLRB’s Inspector General has concluded that William Emanuel violated his ethics agreement &amp; participated in a case where he had a clear conflict of interest. Emanuel no longer has the credibility to do his job. He should resign immediately. https://t.co/nB505vVpcw
*****************************
Congress just made it legal to pay minor league baseball players less than minimum wage &amp; stripped away their overtime protections. This isn’t just bad policy – it’s bad baseball. Talented players shouldn’t be shut out because they can’t make a living. https://t.co/yB1AlwoFGs
*****************************
This week, I’ll travel to Japan, South Korea, &amp; China to discuss US economic &amp; security interests in the region. If we want to succeed in Asia, America needs a foreign policy that leverages all our national power – not just our military might. https://t.co/eW98gAS4hY
*****************************
The only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether they can handle the job. By putting gender identity first, @realDonaldTrump undermines readiness and caters to extremists who don't respect the sacrifices of our troops. Shameful.
*****************************
Happy 8th birthday to the ACA – which forced insurers to start putting patients over profits and made a huge difference in the lives of millions of people. We've fought hard for it – and now we’re fighting for better, more affordable care for all. https://t.co/DMOxD1u0gS
*****************************
Spending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money on fancy furniture is outrageous, but the biggest scandal of Ben Carson's tenure is his refusal to enforce the laws that reduce housing discrimination and segregation in this country. https://t.co/g9Tx0ZDQDq

Finding affordable child care today can be an impossible task. That’s why I fought tooth &amp; nail to nearly double child care funding in this year’s federal budget to $2.37B – the largest increase in the history of the program that will help tens of thousands of families. https://t.co/twTEt2PZgc
*****************************
The @NewYorkFed is about to choose its next president. Every past head has been white, male, &amp; cozy with big banks. How about we try someone with a new perspective and background – who’s actually willing to stand up for American families and workers?

The #BankLobbyistAct is only going to get worse. House Republicans &amp; bank lobbyists want the bill to roll back more consumer protections and include more big bank giveaways. Senate supporters of this bill must not let a bad bill get even more dangerous. https://t.co/7FDSPyfhRY

Too many Americans have to battle with their insurance companies just to see their doctor or get a prescription filled. We need a health care system that puts patients first – not insurance companies. https://t.co/kQKSN143ga
*****************************
In Massachusetts, we have the highest health care coverage rate &amp; some of the lowest premiums in the country. That didn’t happen by accident: we set tough rules for insurance companies &amp; insisted they focus on families over profits. We can do the same at the federal level.
*****************************
My new bill would help stop the nasty tricks that insurance companies use to hold our health care hostage and drive up costs for families – and build on the ACA to improve the quality &amp; affordability of health insurance. https://t.co/2uXUQ3gBTC

If we want to make the promise of our legal system real, then everyone must be held equally accountable when they break our laws. We can start by bringing the white supremacists who attacked DeAndre Harris in Charlottesville to justice.
*****************************
DeAndre Harris was severely beaten by white supremacists in Charlottesville. Were those men brought to justice? No. Instead, DeAndre was prosecuted for accidentally hitting a while supremacist with a flashlight. It's absolutely mind-boggling.
*****************************
The words above the Supreme Court read "Equal Justice Under Law" – and that's supposed to be the basic promise of our legal system. But the DeAndre Harris case shows us we still have a long way to go. https://t.co/kRqLEtslVK

Dear Tim Sloan: @WellsFargo is getting sanctioned by regulators left and right. You already made 291x more than your average employee. Now you’re getting a $4.6 million raise and want praise because you’re not getting a bonus on top? You should be fired, not rewarded. https://t.co/Vr6rBG94xO
*****************************
Big banks like @WellsFargo won't clean up their act until executives start facing real consequences. I introduced the “Ending Too Big to Jail Act” to make sure executives who cheat their customers get hit with jail time – not raises.  https://t.co/dT9V2Uz8Mz
*****************************

I’m not giving up. We need real accountability for big banks – and the people who run them. I just introduced a new bill – the Ending Too Big to Jail Act – to help ensure bank executives are hauled out of their offices in handcuffs when they break the law. https://t.co/dT9V2Uz8Mz
*****************************
Exactly ten years after the financial crisis began, the Senate has voted 67-31 to pass the #BankLobbyistAct and roll back important regulations on America’s biggest banks. We fought hard, but the big banks and their lobbyists won this round.

*****************************
These aren't “community banks” – these are huge financial institutions that wrecked out economy in 2008 &amp; sucked down about $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts. The #BankLobbyistAct takes them off the watch list &amp; puts us at risk for another financial crisis.https://t.co/kqrJ4p2bG0
*****************************
Zions Bancorporation got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But last spring the CEO begged to be taken off the government watch list. He got his wish – the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @ZionsBank as your local community bank.
*****************************
Comerica Incorporated controls about $72 billion in assets today &amp; has naming rights to a MLB stadium – but taxpayers spent $2.25 billion bailing it out during the 2008 financial crisis. And the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @ComericaCares as if it were a tiny community bank.
*****************************
Huntington Bancshares Incorporated got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @Huntington_Bank as your local community bank.
*****************************
Regions Financial Corporation has about 1,500 branches and 1,900 ATMs. It also got $3.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. If the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @askRegions could get the same level of federal oversight as a small community bank.
*****************************
Keycorp is doing pretty well these days – it made almost $1.3 billion last year. That’s a lot of growth since the 2008 crash, when it got $2.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate KeyCorp as if it were a small community bank.
*****************************
Fifth Third Bancorp got $3.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis and has more than 1,100 branches. But if the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @fifththird could get the same amount of federal oversight as your local community bank.
*****************************
BB&amp;T Corporation has over 2,000 branches across the country and controls $221 billion in assets. It received $3.13 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @BBT as your neighborhood community bank.
*****************************
SunTrust Bank got $4.85B in taxpayer bailouts after the financial crisis. It’s recovered pretty well. It controls $206B in assets and has a MLB stadium named after it. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @Suntrust as if it were a small community bank.
*****************************
The #BankLobbyistAct will roll back rules on 25 of America’s 40 biggest banks. Combined, they got nearly $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis – and they’re back to making record profits.
*****************************
America's biggest banks crashed the economy and took billions in taxpayer bailouts. Today, they're making record profits. But they still want more and their wish list is in the #BankLobbyistAct, which the Senate plans to pass this week. I'll fight it to the bitter end. https://t.co/iPVZeAvZKH

*****************************
6. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks from this bill from merging or acquiring another bank for 5 years. Loosening the rules on these big banks will lead to more consolidation in the banking industry unless Congress prohibits it. https://t.co/nnjTTQcpt0
*****************************
5. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks as a result of this bill from buying back stock for 5 years. Why would we loosen the rules on big banks just so they can shower more money on wealthy shareholders and executives? https://t.co/aGVTMg47qM
*****************************
4. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that have outsourced more than 50 jobs in the last 5 years. Congress should reward keeping jobs here at home – not do favors for banks that move jobs overseas. https://t.co/ML8oA7ei5e
*****************************
3. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that were fined over $10 million by regulators in the last 10 years. These banks have caused enough damage already – think of the harm they could do with even fewer rules. https://t.co/rzkk7EXMDg
*****************************
2. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that are under Justice Department supervision after being busted for breaking the law. They broke the rules already – they shouldn't be rewarded with less oversight. https://t.co/P95w6VPlzi
*****************************
1. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks      that received over $1 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crisis. They already wrecked our economy once – we can't let them do it again. https://t.co/D8Ah69cBad

Valeria, a die-hard Patriots fan, came from Brazil at age 7 with her mother and younger sister. Her sister applied for DACA, but @realdonaldtrump ended it before she could be approved. She's counting on a #DreamActNow to keep her family together. https://t.co/25qFgqA1Ox

President​ Trump decided to end DACA effective today, placing the futures of 800,000 Dreamers in limbo. Congress urgently needs to solve this problem and pass a #DreamActNow - these kids are worth fighting for. #ProtectDreamers
*****************************
DACA expires tomorrow – and the future of 800,000 Dreamers is more  uncertain than ever. Here are the stories of 7 Dreamers who are holding  out hope that Congress will pass a #DreamActNow. https://t.co/iSXTnGBa9k
*****************************
In her last act as Fed Chair, Janet Yellen took significant steps to hold @WellsFargo accountable for its fake accounts scam. I asked her successor, Jerome Powell, how the Fed would ensure the bank sticks to the new rules. He seems to think his staff can handle that. I disagree. https://t.co/3y02EFkpRe

Are you having déjà vu yet? The #BankLobbyistAct doesn’t benefit anyone besides the big banks. It’s time for the rest of us to fight back and demand that Washington work for us, not the big bank lobbyists. https://t.co/ds2ryUBdhn
*****************************
We’ve been down this road before. Whenever things are going ok in the financial system, the lobbyists flood the halls of Congress &amp; convince politicians to roll back the rules – because what could possibly go wrong? https://t.co/7rUKIajJ8Q
*****************************
The #BankLobbyistAct takes 25 of the 40 biggest banks in the country off the watch list for more federal oversight. It weakens consumer protections on mortgages – and makes it harder to fight racial discrimination in housing. https://t.co/69zXffiLFt
*****************************
The Senate – with the support of some Democrats – is set to start debate on a bill to roll back regulations on the same big banks we bailed out a few years ago. If we lose the final vote next week, we’ll be paving the way for the next big crash. https://t.co/i7HO3AvNJ9

I have a bill with @MarkWarner that would impose massive, mandatory penalties when companies like @Equifax expose millions of Americans’ personal information. If we want to prevent another #EquifaxBreach, the Senate should pass it. https://t.co/s95R4Do8x1
*****************************
.@Equifax can’t be trusted. Their mistakes allowed the breach to happen, their response has been a failure, and they still can’t level with the public. Enough is enough. We have to start holding the credit reporting industry accountable. https://t.co/p9oKVLqyHb
*****************************
I spent 5 months investigating the #EquifaxBreach, and found the company failed to disclose the full extent of the hack. Today, @Equifax acknowledged that 2.4 million MORE people were affected than initially reported. https://t.co/XAY9nLKqYM

To end sexual harassment &amp; discrimination in the workplace, we need to hold companies accountable. I introduced a bill w/@RepJackyRosen to force public companies to disclose their sexual harassment settlements. Investors – and employees – deserve to know. https://t.co/aYfzrWq57R
*****************************
Today, #SCOTUS heard arguments in Janus v. AFSCME. I know which side I’m on in this case – standing with teachers, nurses, firefighters, &amp; workers who want to #UnrigtheSystem &amp; join together to fight for higher wages, better benefits, &amp; retirement security:https://t.co/MgoYaU05VZ
*****************************
I’ve pressed the @NLRB for months about William Emanuel’s conflicts of interest, and the Inspector General is now investigating. Today, I asked the board to reconsider their decision, and they just said they will: https://t.co/MX5WWl56oH
*****************************
William Emanuel’s list of potential conflicts of interest is a mile long – and he was the key vote in a recent @NLRB decision that could allow big companies (including those represented by his former employer) to shirk their responsibilities to employees. https://t.co/GXuZF0h4bc
*****************************
The @NLRB is supposed to protect the rights of workers to organize and fight for better wages. But the GOP has stacked its board with anti-worker, big money insiders – including William Emanuel, who used to represent big companies in cases against workers.
*****************************
On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear Janus v. AFSCME – the latest case in a years-long assault by powerful right-wing billionaires against workers. If AFSCME loses, so will nurses, teachers, police, and firefighters all across our country. #UnrigtheSystem https://t.co/4GoGyK3Abo

American consumers deserve a straight answer, so today I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB again: Why are you using the @CFPB to prop up payday lenders? https://t.co/XqBj00N4F5
*****************************
My motives are clear – if @MickMulvaneyOMB is interested, he can watch my speech explaining why I supported the @CFPB’s rule limiting forced arbitration. But he still hasn't explained why he’s been protecting the interests of payday lenders who financed his political campaigns. https://t.co/1FtnUa98d5

I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB why he has repeatedly sided with abusive payday lenders over American families at the @CFPB. He refused to answer, and questioned my motives instead: https://t.co/GguCdiWaLM

*****************************
@WellsFargo is great at overcharging its customers for accounts and products they never asked for – but it still hasn’t figured out how to refund its victims. The CEO needs to explain why he’s making people jump through hoops just to get their money back. https://t.co/MEAHIpV6WW

Claudia works six days a week as a dental assistant, and at nights goes to school to study engineering. Her Aunt Glenda has an adorable little girl she calls her “little person.” Dreamers are part of America. This is their home. That’s why I’m fighting for a #DreamActNow. https://t.co/lbkh4Wlxnh

My heart goes out to everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. No student should have to fear going to school. No parent should have to hear their child won’t be coming home. And tragedies like this should never happen. https://t.co/xJ5NA6eLNw
*****************************
The big banks &amp; payday lenders that funded @MickMulvaneyOMB’s campaigns are doing cartwheels over @CFPB’s new strategic plan. Mulvaney wants the agency to stand up for big banks and scammers instead of holding them accountable when they cheat consumers. https://t.co/GUnk4OXm9Z
*****************************
America’s infrastructure is broken. But instead of making real investments to fix it, @realdonaldtrump wants to pass the burden on to local governments &amp; let private companies make up the difference. Americans want safer roads &amp; bridges – not higher tolls. https://t.co/7CsBbZbQpq
*****************************
Equifax must clarify its confusing and incomplete story of the #EquifaxBreach. We've got to keep the heat on @Equifax &amp; we need better laws to hold credit reporting agencies accountable: https://t.co/0mZ1ZHqiHG

My investigation revealed the depth of the breach and cover-up at @Equifax. And since I published the report, Equifax has confirmed it is even worse than they told us. https://t.co/6bGvZWqlQI

It was a challenge to find affordable child care for my own kids – it's even harder for parents today. So I fought to get more child care funding in this budget.

The more you look at the details of the #EquifaxBreach, the worse it gets. Congress needs to pass the bill I introduced with @MarkWarner to impose tough penalties on credit bureaus like @Equifax when they compromise our data. https://t.co/jwdUD3w2CP
*****************************
According to its own policies, @Equifax was supposed to let people know if their info was hacked. But they only notified 2.5 million. Everyone else had to go to a website that was easily spoofed and put people's data in even greater danger. #EquifaxBreach https://t.co/cBR9c5NsRX
*****************************
Despite its many security failures, @Equifax used a loophole to get a big contract from the IRS after the breach. It then raised its prices – cheating American taxpayers out of millions of dollars. #EquifaxBreach https://t.co/xupIwcWe8g
*****************************
Hackers didn’t just get a glimpse at the data of millions of Americans – they stole it from @Equifax’s system and could have access to it forever. #EquifaxBreach https://t.co/TpgS5lMAk0
*****************************
It’s clear that @MickMulvaneyOMB isn’t interested in protecting consumers from the next #EquifaxBreach – but I am. That’s why I launched an investigation into the breach 5 months ago. Here’s what I found. (The details are worse than you think.) https://t.co/DvmI26hm1z

The @USDOL's Inspector General is now reviewing @realDonaldTrump's shady effort to reverse a rule letting tipped workers keep their earnings. Good.

*****************************
We can’t rely on bought-and-paid-for @MickMulvaneyOMB to do anything about @Equifax. Congress needs to take action – like passing the bill @markwarner &amp; I introduced to ensure there are severe, automatic penalties for credit bureaus that expose your data. https://t.co/s95R4Do8x1

.@realDonaldTrump has filled our top economic jobs with people obsessed with sucking up to Wall Street, &amp; today is Yellen’s last day at the Fed. Tomorrow, her replacement will face a choice: show the same kind of courage – or own the next financial crisis. https://t.co/lJq1A3OXBg
*****************************
The massive fraud at Wells Fargo showed the whole country that we need more accountability on Wall Street. But for more than a year, we've watched as @realDonaldTrump and his government have raced to turn the big banks loose again to once again threaten our whole economy.
*****************************
Chair Yellen’s decision today to freeze the growth of Wells Fargo until it shapes up also demonstrates that we have the tools to rein in Wall Street – if our regulators have the guts to use them. This one hits them where it hurts.
*****************************
Fines alone will never rein in fraudulent behavior at the big banks. We need tough penalties that affect the actual lives of the people who run the banks. By pushing out Board Members at Wells Fargo, Chair Yellen sent a strong message.  https://t.co/k5StPPvKRp
*****************************
For months, I have repeatedly pressed Janet Yellen to hold Wells Fargo accountable for its fake accounts scam and push out responsible Board Members. Today she did it – in her last act as Fed Chair. https://t.co/ebIkhu8R0a

.@realDonaldTrump just released his new nuclear strategy, which calls for more nuclear weapons that are easier to use. This flies in the face of decades of American leadership in building a safer world – one with fewer nuclear weapons. #NuclearPostureReview https://t.co/cU7jzlT96h
*****************************
This week @GOPHELP released a paper that argues for gutting accountability for shady #4profit colleges – like cheating students is no big deal. I don’t know about you – but I think that’s ridiculous. Judge for yourself: https://t.co/BPaevPh3Hs
*****************************
The only thing shocking about the GOP's partisan memo is the contempt its release shows for the rule of law &amp; American national security. Russia is still trying to undermine our democracy – until this government starts putting this country ahead of politics, we are all at risk.
*****************************
Want to hear something outrageous? @USDOL buried a study on the Trump Admin's plan to make it harder for tipped workers to earn a living - because the data showed it would cost workers billions. The Admin must release the study &amp; end its assault on workers.https://t.co/Gfj3N85wuE

Honored that Jean Bradley Derenoncourt will be my #SOTU guest. He immigrated to Brockton from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, became a citizen &amp; the first Haitian-American man elected in MA. He embodies American values of hard work, service, &amp; persistence.https://t.co/DZC9lWdL8p

The GOP bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks would force women with severe health issues to stay pregnant until their lives are endangered, and force those with unviable fetuses to carry to term. This bill is dangerous and cruel – we cannot let it pass. #NoAbortionBan
*****************************
Today, the Senate will vote on a bill to ban all abortions after 20 weeks, with limited exceptions. Only 1% of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later – and the reasons are heartbreaking.
*****************************
We’re still defending women’s reproductive rights 45 years after #RoevWade. Why? Because politicians who’ve never been pregnant and had to make these gut-wrenching decisions want to score political points at the expense of women and their families.
*****************************
Elias, Madelyn, &amp; Ledys came to the US as children, and built lives out of hard work and hope. But time is running out for them and 800,000 Dreamers. Congress must pass the #DreamActNow. https://t.co/26XaWQRKk4

“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference." Today as we remember the horrors of the Holocaust and the six million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime, I think of Elie Wiesel's words. We must actively resist hate and bigotry in all its forms. #WeRemember

By ending DACA, @realdonaldtrump subjected 800k Dreamers to deportation. Now he wants to hold them hostage to Steven Miller’s anti-immigrant wish list. It’s insulting. We already have a bipartisan solution to the Trump-created crisis: it’s called the Dream Act. #DreamActNow

It’s been over 100 days since protection for 800k Dreamers ended, since community health centers were funded, since hurricanes ravaged TX, FL &amp; PR. The Republicans refused to fix any of these issues– and they still haven't fixed them. We don't need new promises. We need new laws.
*****************************
The GOP controls every branch of govt. I repeat: They control the WH &amp; Congress. They've lurched from crisis to crisis for months w/o funding disaster recovery, health centers or children's health care. All while Dreamers hang in the balance. This is no way to govern.

*****************************
@realDonaldTrump This week, @realdonaldtrump faces a choice: keep the #IranDeal intact, or re-impose nuclear sanctions that would violate the agreement and make it easier for Iran to get a nuclear bomb.
*****************************
Since 2015, the #IranDeal has blocked Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb. So far, the deal is working. But @realdonaldtrump’s refusal to recertify it could change that.
*****************************
@USChamber Here’s the basic problem in Washington. Big business lobbyists are so used to running the place that they label anyone willing to stand up to them as extreme. When Tom Donohue and the @USChamber attack me for standing up to corporate interests, I know I’m doing my job.
*****************************
Earlier today I introduced a bill to hold big companies like Equifax accountable to consumers.  Then millionaire lobbyist Tom Donohue who runs the @USChamber called me an extremist.
*****************************
@MarkWarner @Equifax If we want @Equifax and other credit reporting agencies to act responsibly with our data, we need to hold them accountable when they screw up. https://t.co/0mZ1ZHqiHG

@MarkWarner @Equifax Had this law been in place during the Equifax breach, the company would have had to pay at least $1.5 billion in fines – half of which would have gone straight back to affected consumers. Instead, @Equifax likely made money off the hack.

The Trump Admin’s use of TPS to initiate wholesale deportations is fundamentally wrong. These actions do not make America stronger or safer - they weaken our economy and our communities.
*****************************
First, the Trump Admin ended Temporary Protected Status for 2,500 Nicaraguans. Then, nearly 60,000 Haitians. Today, @realdonaldtrump crossed another item off his anti-immigrant agenda by terminating TPS for 200,000 Salvadorans.

We need to fight for judges that protect the rights of all Americans, not just the wealthy &amp; the well-connected. That’s why I will be voting against these judicial nominees, &amp; I urge my colleagues to do the same.
*****************************
This week, the GOP Senate will vote on Steven Grasz, Donny Willett, &amp; James Ho to sit on the federal courts of appeals. The records of all 3 nominees show that they will favor powerful interests over workers, women, LGBTQ individuals, people of color, &amp; religious minorities.
*****************************
Now that there’s a GOP President who’s committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich &amp; the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment.
*****************************
For years, the GOP have worked hand-in-hand with billionaire-funded right-wing groups to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy &amp; powerful over those of everybody else.
*****************************
Are you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand? Do you know who you're picking a fight with? Good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump. Nevertheless, #shepersisted. https://t.co/mYJtBZfxiu
*****************************
The American people deserve to know how this #GOPTaxScam will impact the economy and how it will affect middle-class families. @USTreasury promised an economic analysis – but this isn’t it. I look forward to the IG’s investigation providing real answers for American families.
*****************************
To recap: After claiming repeatedly he had projections showing the #GOPTaxScam paid for itself, Mnuchin released a report showing that there were no such projections, and that even his own wildly optimistic made-up projections weren’t enough for the plan to pay for itself.
*****************************
Where does the other half of the growth come from according to @USTreasury? Partly from proposals that haven’t even been introduced in Congress and may never happen. https://t.co/aZpZlfdcgX
*****************************
But it’s worse: even Mnuchin’s made-up numbers on the corporate tax changes only get Republicans halfway to the economic growth numbers they’re claiming.
*****************************
Mnuchin’s projection is completely out of line with other projections. It's way higher than credible estimates, and even higher than right-wing projections that ignore the effect of the national debt on growth. https://t.co/7C6KCIWwOB
*****************************
In other words: @USTreasury’s OTP couldn’t support Mnuchin’s claims about economic growth, so he just said it again without evidence.
*****************************
While @USTreasury’s OTP made other projections in this report, it didn’t make the key projection that growth would go up about .35% annually thanks to the corporate tax changes in the GOP tax bill.
*****************************
A bit of important background on this claim. @USTreasury includes the Office of Tax Policy (OTP). The OTP is staffed by non-political tax experts and economists, who are responsible for projecting the economic impact of changes to the tax code.
*****************************
But how does the report show that economic growth WILL be 2.9% instead of 2.2% thanks to the GOP tax plan? It doesn’t! Instead, @USTreasury "expects approximately half" of this additional growth to come from corporate tax changes. https://t.co/Vv6MGNCH9j
*****************************
@USTreasury The @USTreasury report says that IF economic growth is 2.9% instead of 2.2% over the next ten years, then the national debt will go down despite the GOP plan’s massive tax giveaway to big corporations. Oh really?
*****************************
In this bogus report, @USTreasury was supposed to use its economic models to project how the GOP tax plan would affect economic growth.
 
It didn't do that. It just made up the numbers.
*****************************
After I requested an investigation, @USTreasury finally released its "analysis" of the #GOPTaxScam. This one-page report is pathetic – and shows Secretary Mnuchin has no basis for claiming that the tax plan "will pay for itself with growth." https://t.co/3KjogQLeHE https://t.co/ZmcwxSkcQN

*****************************
I don’t think a single middle class family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations &amp; billionaires can pay less. Big corporations should pay MORE so that we can cut taxes on working families &amp; small businesses &amp; invest in our future. #GOPTaxScam
*****************************
The #GOPTaxScam is a smash-and-grab job. The GOP don’t even try to hide the corruption. And they don’t worry about how many middle class families are hurt in the caper.
*****************************
This #GOPTaxScam is about paying off the rich, corporate donors that helped get the @SenateGOP elected. It’s about the way money has corrupted Washington: millions in campaign contributions for billions in tax giveaways.
*****************************
The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about fiscal responsibility. For years, the GOP have whined about exploding debt. If this trillion-dollar #GOPTaxScam passes, the @SenateGOP will turn around next week &amp; say – sorry! There’s no money for Medicare, Medicaid, education, housing, you name it.
*****************************
The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about economic growth or jobs. Trickle down doesn’t work. But don’t take my word for it: top execs have admitted that they’ll use tax giveaways to buy back stock &amp; fund new mergers. Nothing for workers.
*****************************
The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about helping working people. It RAISES taxes for millions of middle class families. The @SenateGOP had their chance to vote to make middle class tax cuts permanent this afternoon. They voted NO.
*****************************
I’m glad @USTreasury's IG responded quickly to my request.

The @Equifax hack is a nightmare. I introduced the FREE Act to give consumers back control of their data. Congress should pass it ASAP. https://t.co/RtiC0tkc9Q
*****************************
Heading to the floor to discuss the @Equifax breach. People are right to be outraged. https://t.co/jc1R7Es8hG
*****************************
@SenateGOP Tonight I’m joining @SenateDems on the floor to fight (again) to save Americans’ health care. Watch live now: https://t.co/jc1R7Es8hG
*****************************
Cassidy-Graham is just another version of the same old heartless “health care” plan the @SenateGOP have tried to jam down our throats.
*****************************
Happy Birthday, @usairforce! Happy to celebrate last week by speaking with Senior Airman Schultz of Springfield, now deployed to SW Asia. https://t.co/G6WRWDnLFx
*****************************
My thoughts are with the Marseille acid attack victims, reportedly BC students. My office has reached out to BC to help however we can.
*****************************
The fight to save heath care isn't over. Sound the alarm. We need you to fight today &amp; every day until this @SenateGOP bill is dead.
*****************************
Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP "health care" bill IS Trumpcare, &amp; it will rip health care away from millions of Americans.
*****************************
Coverage ripped away from tens of millions of Americans with Graham-Cassidy – kids with disabilities, grandparents in nursing homes.
*****************************
Graham-Cassidy completely eliminates help for families to buy health insurance. Gone. Good luck on your own.
*****************************
The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy "health care" bill cuts Medicaid funding &amp; rolls back protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
*****************************
There's nothing new &amp; improved about the Graham-Cassidy bill – it's the same cruel @SenateGOP "health care" bill, but on steroids.
*****************************
The @SenateGOP have a big 9/30 deadline to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And here's the scary thing: they might have the votes to do it.

*****************************
.@AnthemInc's decision is great – but insurers making huge profits off taxpayers shouldn’t need to be shamed into providing coverage.
*****************************
Today, @AnthemInc sheepishly announced that they’re partially reversing their decision to leave VA. https://t.co/PBdBMxFub0
*****************************
Yesterday, I called out @AnthemInc for abandoning people in states because Congress won’t help them to squeeze huge profits out of patients. https://t.co/y65E14odXK

@Equifax @gao @FTC @CFPB @USGAO We're fighting to hold @Equifax accountable. In the meantime, the @CFPB has a helpful guide to protect yourself: https://t.co/DN3uyhomux
*****************************
I sent letters to @Equifax, the other credit reporting agencies, regulators, &amp; @GAO to figure out how we can reform this broken industry. https://t.co/qL0oN7OQhz
*****************************
On top of these bills, I launched an investigation into the @Equifax breach &amp; credit reporting industry in general. https://t.co/VLssJGpmC6
*****************************
Bad credit doesn’t make you a bad employee. Workers should compete on the merits, not on their credit scores.
*****************************
Credit reports are already riddled with errors. The @Equifax hack will make it worse. Inaccurate reports shouldn't hurt your job chances.
*****************************
I also reintroduced the Equal Employment for All Act to prevent employers from asking job applicants for their credit histories. https://t.co/dYO2PXEPWs
*****************************
The idea behind our bill is simple: @Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.
*****************************
The FREE Act lets you freeze – and unfreeze – access to your credit file at no cost. It's like a free Do Not Call list for your credit data.
*****************************
Companies like @Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent, then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts.
*****************************
I introduced the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act with @brianschatz. Our bill gives you more control of your data. https://t.co/l5pboE0t4q
*****************************
Lot of people are outraged about the @Equifax data breach. I am too. Here’s what I’ve been doing about it this week.
*****************************
Today I told an @AnthemInc VP: If they want to make huge profits off taxpayers, they ought to provide decent coverage through the ACA. https://t.co/i6KU8bRKg2
*****************************
More than half of @AnthemInc's revenue comes from programs like Medicare &amp; Medicaid. But they're abandoning people in ACA exchanges.
*****************************
Insurance giant @AnthemInc sent Congress a ransom note: bigger tax cuts, or they’d pull out of more state health care exchanges.
*****************************
When the GOP tried to repeal the ACA, some – like @BCBSMA – fought for their customers. But not @AnthemInc.
*****************************
Undermining the INF Treaty is grossly irresponsible. Heading to the floor now to discuss my NDAA amendment. Watch: https://t.co/jc1R7Es8hG
*****************************
Today I stood with @SenSanders to support his Medicare for All bill. Health care is a basic human right &amp; we fight for basic human rights. https://t.co/Pv7pu8fOM3
*****************************
@USChamber The companies paying for a @USChamber membership – they’re being taken for a ride.
*****************************
.@USChamber sucks billions of dollars from member companies – so it’ll pick a losing fight if it has to, as long as the money keeps flowing.
*****************************
The fiduciary rule is working for consumers, start-ups and big investment companies. So why is the Chamber of Commerce trying to kill it? https://t.co/mqhDnNK0Hj
*****************************
@RandPaul It’s long past time for Congress to do right by our troops &amp; the American people, which is why I’m supporting @RandPaul’s AUMF amendment.
*****************************
.@RandPaul is fighting for an amendment to the annual defense bill that would repeal the AUMF &amp; give Congress six months to replace it.
*****************************
It’s been 16 yrs since Congress passed the existing AUMF after 9/11, but yr after yr, Congress refuses to re-examine this outdated policy.
*****************************
Congress owes our troops &amp; their families a full debate to authorize the use of military force before we send them into harm’s way.
*****************************
Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed on why we must give opioid addiction treatment providers the support they need. https://t.co/HVdk8y0KCJ

*****************************
The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this -- as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it.
*****************************
That's right: @Equifax fails to protect your data and then they demand you give up legal rights if you want to limit the damage they caused.
*****************************
.@Equifax is forcing you to give up your right to join a class action against the company if you want their credit protection product. https://t.co/anu0SE58wg
*****************************
The @Equifax breach is Exhibit A for why we must stop @GOP from reversing the @CFPB's rule protecting your right to join class actions.
*****************************
It's also outrageous that @Equifax waited so long to disclose the breach -- needlessly leaving nearly half of America at risk for a month.
*****************************
It's outrageous that @Equifax -- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans.

We cannot sit back while our family, friends &amp; neighbors are driven out of their homes. We must fight to protect Dreamers &amp; #DefendDACA.
*****************************
America should keep its promises. If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know that, then Congress must act to make DACA permanent. #DefendDACA
*****************************
Turning our backs on Dreamers makes us weaker, makes us less safe, &amp; betrays our values. #DefendDACA
*****************************
Subjecting Dreamers to mass deportation is part of the bigoted policies that are a cornerstone of @realDonaldTrump’s admin. #DefendDACA

*****************************
We make judgments as humans &amp; as a country about right &amp; wrong. When there's evil, we all need to say it. Especially our President.

How can @realDonaldTrump can show whose side he's on? He can start by publicly calling this what it is: white supremacy.

*****************************
The nightmare is over, at least for now.
*****************************
“Skinny repeal” is reckless, cruel &amp; immoral. If the @SenateGOP pass this bill, they'll show they just don’t care about American families.
*****************************
Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that you’re going to vote for it.
*****************************
Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no.
*****************************
Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land.
*****************************
If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill.
*****************************
And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
*****************************
CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured. https://t.co/huOjkQsfha
*****************************
This @SenateGOP bill they’re voting on tonight kills a part of the ACA key to keeping insurance affordable for everyone.
*****************************
From what I can tell, “skinny repeal” just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act.
*****************************
So here’s the deal: In the dead of night tonight, the @SenateGOP will try to pass a “skinny repeal” of health care.
*****************************
The @SenateGOP “skinny bill” is here and it’s exactly as wretched as we thought it’d be. https://t.co/nRxBnQloQB
*****************************
"C’mon, @SenateGOP. Pass a terrible 'skinny repeal' of health care &amp; we'll 'fix it' in committee!” ?!? https://t.co/fv5Uc9lro1
*****************************
Health care for millions of Americans hangs in the balance and it will all unfold tonight. Here’s what’s happening: https://t.co/gF4A42GxBq
*****************************
The American people don’t think that guaranteed health care is a joke. I look forward to the @SenateGOP learning that lesson.
*****************************
The @SenateGOP thinks guaranteed health care is all a big joke. They’re using it as a cynical ploy to play political football.
*****************************
.@SenSanders is correct: Health care is a right, not a privilege. We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone has access to it.
*****************************
None of this needs to happen, and I hope it doesn’t. https://t.co/4LsASr4es2
*****************************
We won't let the @SenateGOP pass a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood and strips women's access to basic medical care. We will fight back. https://t.co/QCkqcp76Oq
*****************************
"Skinny repeal" should be called "gut it and run." Voting to destroy insurance markets and kick millions off health care remains immoral. https://t.co/D8N1Jlk6tD
*****************************
If the Senate passes "skinny repeal" then the @GOP will go into a back room to "compromise" between 15M and 23M people losing health care.
*****************************
And "skinny repeal" would likely result in at least 15 MILLION people losing health insurance. https://t.co/v40pO3cQua
*****************************
If the Senate passes "skinny repeal" – which guts the marketplace – premiums will skyrocket. Insurers will quit.
*****************************
Senators can hide their final health care bill from the public, but they can't hide from the consequences of their votes.
*****************************
.@SenateDems will vote to protect Planned Parenthood – and we will vote down this terrible proposal.
*****************************
These next votes are on “repeal and run” of the Affordable Care Act – with a ban on Planned Parenthood funding thrown in for kicks.
*****************************
This morning @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s second attempt at ripping health care away from millions of people.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful &amp; makes us less safe.
*****************************
By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness.
*****************************
The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
*****************************
This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.
*****************************
In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them.
*****************************
Tonight @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s first attempt at ripping health care away from millions.
*****************************
I'll be talking with Rachel @Maddow about the @SenateGOP’s immoral health care vote soon. Tune in.

.@realdonaldtrump's budget would impose deep cuts to opioid crisis funding. We can't let this budget be the final word. https://t.co/90MzGZjfqZ

@realDonaldTrump I’m heading to the Senate floor now to discuss Trumpcare’s devastating impact on working families. Watch: https://t.co/jc1R7EJJ9e
*****************************
And @realDonaldTrump’s indefensible budget &amp; unforgivable Trumpcare bill cuts the money needed to fight our country’s opioid crisis.
*****************************
The GOP Trumpcare plan is as clear as it is cruel: destroy health care for tens of millions in order to give tax cuts to rich people.
*****************************
We need more investments in NIH, not less. I’ll fight for MA &amp; oppose these misguided cuts for scientific research.
*****************************
My new report shows: NIH funding is critical for MA scientists. But @realDonaldTrump wants to cut NIH by $5.7B. https://t.co/U3r8Su4kWb https://t.co/x1N86CxQ09

There are many reasons to oppose Judge Thapar’s nom for the Sixth Circuit, but one should concern everyone: his money in politics. https://t.co/2wmnPOTT14

*****************************
The numbers don’t lie here: this new version of Trumpcare will still bankrupt American families. People will die.
*****************************
Trumpcare is devastating for the poor. Seniors. Pregnant women. People w/ pre-existing conditions, mental health &amp; substance use disorders.
*****************************
The CBO confirmed: Trumpcare is a $663 BILLION tax cut for the rich paid for by kicking 23 MILLION people off of insurance. End of story. https://t.co/lLVhpTMhpu

We should be expanding Social Security, not cutting it. We won’t let the GOP dismantle Social Security inch by inch with this budget.

.@realDonaldTrump promised not to cut Social Security. I’ve looked at the budget, &amp; here it is: $73B in Social Security cuts. https://t.co/9QYxEwUPxs
*****************************
Trumpcare isn’t a health care plan – it’s a cruel joke. We need to fight back with everything we have to make sure it never becomes reality.
*****************************
Under Trumpcare, 445k MA residents would lose healthcare. We’d lose $10B in state funding. And out-of-pocket costs would skyrocket.
*****************************
A new analysis out today shows: Trumpcare will hit Massachusetts like a sledgehammer. https://t.co/f03ZTPOpA1

Sessions played a role in firing FBI Director Comey – a firing @realDonaldTrump said was, in part, based on Comey’s Russia investigation.
*****************************
After getting caught lying about contact with the Russians, Sessions said he’d recused himself from the Trump-Russia investigation.

Settlements may be tax deductible or have credits hidden in fine print. If the gov is going to cut deals, we should know what we’re getting.

.@SenJeffMerkley  is a champion for working families – and he showed it overnight when he spoke for more than 15 hours about Judge Gorsuch.

*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump I’m heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I oppose Neil Gorsuch &amp; why he should not be confirmed: https://t.co/jc1R7Es8hG
*****************************
It’s clear that @realDonaldTrump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, doesn’t have enough support in the Senate to be confirmed.
*****************************
.@VP On the Senate floor now to fight for Title X &amp; women’s health care centers. Watch: https://t.co/jc1R7EJJ9e
*****************************
Title X is a bipartisan program to provide birth control, cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests, &amp; @VP Pence cast the tiebreaking vote attacking it
*****************************
The GOP vote attacking family planning may deadlock. Will Trump really haul in @mike_pence to cast a historic vote against women’s health?

*****************************
Speaking on the Senate floor about how @realDonaldTrump still threatens to sabotage Americans’ health care. Watch: https://t.co/i7rPX8sPmK
*****************************
This is why we fight. When we get out there &amp; fight, we can make a real difference.
*****************************
But I'm not doing a touchdown dance today. Not when the GOP is still hell-bent on rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful.
*****************************
Today is a great day for the people of Massachusetts &amp; people across the country who depend on the Affordable Care Act.
*****************************
The truth will come out, @GOP. Get on the right side of history before it's too late.
*****************************
The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry.
*****************************
The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign &amp; Russia. When will the GOP end the charade &amp; put country first?
*****************************
Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip.
*****************************
After slamming leaks as "criminal," Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him.
*****************************
Who does House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes think he works for: the American people or @realDonaldTrump?
*****************************
The @SenateGOP would undo @FCC rules &amp; let internet service providers sell private info without telling customers.
https://t.co/v8y2RcIv6D
*****************************
Now the @SenateGOP is obsessed with using the Congressional Review Act to kill every consumer protection rule in sight, like the @FCC rules.
*****************************
.@SenMarkey is right: the @FCC protected consumers by adopting #BroadbandPrivacy rules – on how companies collect/use/share/sell our data.
*****************************
Massachusetts Sec of State Galvin is right to be worried: @realDonaldTrump's bigotry &amp; hate could greatly influence our census results. https://t.co/jt2QwSFh8M

*****************************
The FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait.
*****************************
But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump &amp; move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?
*****************************
I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.
*****************************
Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.
*****************************
Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat.
*****************************
Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about “restructuring” the @CFPB – another way of saying they want to weaken it.
*****************************
The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people – and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.
*****************************
The @CFPB is a tough watchdog for working families, forcing big banks to return more than $12B to people they cheated.
*****************************
Transparency, pressure &amp; activism work. But we’re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students.
*****************************
The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.
*****************************
The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.
*****************************
The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aides’ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned. https://t.co/KIw0enbJ8O
*****************************
I asked Betsy DeVos why 2 of her key aides are fmr for-profit college execs with massive conflicts of interest. https://t.co/NGc3oJGERM
*****************************
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos apparently thinks her job is to hand @usedgov over to people who want to bilk students.

.@realDonaldTrump, your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution. Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump's illegal Muslim ban is still a recruiting tool for ISIS. Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe.
*****************************
Turns out, an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one.
*****************************
Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.
*****************************
Today I told the Senate: If #Trumpcare passes, people will lose access to opioid recovery services. People will die. https://t.co/6x34DLVk61
*****************************
Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this country’s opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.
*****************************
Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.
*****************************
There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.
*****************************
Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?
*****************************
What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?
*****************************
About to speak about the devastating impact that #Trumpcare will have on fighting the opioid crisis in MA. Watch: https://t.co/sHhsGuB8B5
*****************************

Olivia in North Reading has a chronic illness &amp; needs the ACA to stay alive. Will she be in the 24 million, @SenateMajLdr? #Trumpcare
*****************************
Denise from MA has 3 cancer survivors in her family of 4. Will they be in the 24 million who lose under #Trumpcare, @SpeakerRyan?
*****************************
MA residents have been writing, calling, emailing me – deeply worried about their health care. And they have every right to be worried.
*****************************
The budget experts' numbers are in: the GOP #Trumpcare plan will rip health coverage away from 24 million people. https://t.co/sFNLFmNvXo
*****************************
I’ll fight back as Republicans try to gut access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment by repealing ACA &amp; cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid.

*****************************
Newsflash, @realDonaldTrump: The Senate confirms US Attorneys. And you're not replacing real prosecutors with cronies w/out a massive fight.
*****************************
You can't fire the rule of law, @realDonaldTrump. You can't shut down ongoing investigations by career prosecutors.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions – a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians – in @TheJusticeDept.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates – who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynn’s contact with Russia.
*****************************
GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.
*****************************
Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign.
*****************************
Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him.
*****************************
It’s time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.
*****************************
A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions – seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!
*****************************
Republicans seem intent on plowing ahead anyway – pretending down is up, left is right, &amp; #Trumpcare is somehow not a catastrophe.
*****************************
Don’t forget patient advocates like @ACSCAN &amp; @AARPadvocates – they’re appalled by #Trumpcare, too.
*****************************
The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING – docs, hospitals, economists, even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster.

*****************************
I’m heading to the Senate floor now to speak out against GOP’s plan to repeal the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order: https://t.co/dzZQbTR3Rg
*****************************
There’s a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers.
*****************************
Today’s debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. I’m here to fight for workers – &amp; I’ll be voting no.
*****************************
Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts.
*****************************
My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. https://t.co/AOed3xBPYa
*****************************
The US gov pays billions to federal contractors – but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.
*****************************
Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed: https://t.co/WXRhQlTiHz

.@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to let some hearing aids be sold over-the-counter, saving families money &amp; reducing regulations.
*****************************
Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center. Their patients need the ACA for insurance &amp; Medicaid access. https://t.co/6SGzBWOW8q
*****************************
When we’re #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can’t ignore these issues any longer.
*****************************
And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies.
*****************************
Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
*****************************
A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.
*****************************
And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.
*****************************
Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren’t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling.
*****************************
And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who should have never been confirmed in the first place – to resign. We need it now.
*****************************
We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia.
*****************************
This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.
*****************************
Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.
*****************************
Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.
*****************************
It's a simple q: "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"
*****************************
I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj. https://t.co/vrkbsok6ej

I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best – but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA! https://t.co/U0LtDPgwSO
*****************************
For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov. https://t.co/n5KKjRI5ps
*****************************
Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes.
*****************************
.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
*****************************
.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they’ll use Trump’s order to cut off funding for MA services. https://t.co/fPboLE9Pqu
*****************************
MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump’s order on local immigrants.
*****************************
Heading to the Senate floor now to urge my colleagues to reject Wilbur Ross’s nomination for @CommerceGov. Watch: https://t.co/etvzEJEk7W
*****************************
Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
*****************************
Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones.
*****************************
.@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate.
*****************************
.@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week.
*****************************
I’m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch: https://t.co/mWLpJbotzx
*****************************
In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters.
*****************************
Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
*****************************
A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil.
*****************************
This morning I joined 100s of workers who fought their hearts out to stop Andrew Puzder’s @USDOL nomination. Some days, the good guys win. https://t.co/W9Zug5D0Vi

*****************************
Reports say that Andy Puzder is tired &amp; may withdraw his @USDOL nomination. If he can’t stand the heat, he should get out of the kitchen.
*****************************
And on Monday, I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America’s workers. https://t.co/FKuf9NgpvX
*****************************
We detailed more stories from Andy Puzder’s mistreated workers in a report two weeks ago: https://t.co/heeSO53zOx
*****************************
We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder’s burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month: https://t.co/5MUt6XakXn
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump ’s nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder – has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
*****************************
When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.
*****************************
Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake.
*****************************
When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?
*****************************
This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
*****************************
.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.
*****************************
Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.
*****************************
This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.
*****************************
But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
*****************************
Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.
*****************************
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
*****************************
If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?
*****************************
Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump said he’d be tough on Wall Street. That’s a broken promise. #TrumpsBrokenPromises https://t.co/F0E4KUcaF4

I sent Andrew Puzder a 28-pg letter (83 q’s) about his readiness for @USDOL to protect America’s workers. https://t.co/FKuf9NgpvX https://t.co/WQVRhkfrXO
*****************************
Puzder’s company has the most discrimination suits of any major burger chain – the same laws he’d be charged with enforcing at @USDOL.
*****************************
.@CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andrew Puzder made a fortune squeezing his workers – the same workers he’d be charged with protecting at @USDOL.
*****************************
.@SenSchumer’s concerns about Judge Gorsuch should worry everyone who cares about the independence of our courts. https://t.co/o6O6ACA3EY
*****************************
I’m speaking on the Sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote NO on Steve Mnuchin's @USTreasury nomination. https://t.co/89VNNddtKP
*****************************
There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.
*****************************
Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
*****************************
And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too.
*****************************
If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us.
*****************************
If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.
*****************************
There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
*****************************
Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have.
*****************************
Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
*****************************
I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight.
*****************************

*****************************
.@SenateDems are once again going to #holdthefloor all night – this time to speak out against @SenatorSessions’s nomination for AG.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump should listen to companies and to consumers and stop financial adviser conflicts costing savers $17 billion a year.

*****************************
The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis – and they won't forget today.
*****************************
And @realDonaldTrump issued an order that puts 2 @GoldmanSachs execs in charge of gutting the rules that protect you from financial fraud.
*****************************
After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs, @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign – but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on.
*****************************
Tonight I urged my Senate colleagues to vote no on this morally bankrupt giveaway to @exxonmobil: https://t.co/1vcJ8b3w5u
*****************************
Rex Tillerson lobbied against the rule for @exxonmobil to disclose payments to foreign govs because it hurt their business with Russia.
*****************************
The same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson, the @HouseGOP passed a resolution to help @exxonmobil secretly funnel money to dictators.

*****************************
If you’re going to #draintheswamp, prove it, @SenateGOP. Protecting 2 men who lied during their job applications isn’t the way to start.
*****************************
This isn’t a game, @SenateGOP. The safety of our economy &amp; health of our people could be in the hands of 2 men who lied to the US Senate.
*****************************
This morning, the @SenateGOP unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through Price &amp; Mnuchin without a single Democrat present.
*****************************
.@SenateDems insisted: no vote on these nominees until we bring them back in to explain why they lied. Perfectly reasonable, right?
*****************************
.@HHSGov nom Price lied to the Senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @USTreasury nom Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal foreclosures.
*****************************
I strongly oppose Rex Tillerson’s nomination for SecState &amp; will vote against his confirmation today. Here’s why. https://t.co/rfCJvBbBk2

Given what's happening, Rex Tillerson's extensive Russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for America's interests.

I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administration’s disturbing relationship with Russia.
*****************************
No, @realDonaldTrump, your illegal, unconstitutional, immoral Muslim ban is not about keeping us safe at all. https://t.co/vRAyrJXb5O

Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I will be voting NO on Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. Watch: https://t.co/SRRHUnhCre
*****************************
It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
*****************************
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
*****************************
Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law.
*****************************
Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order.
*****************************
Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her.
*****************************
Watch live now as I speak out from the Senate floor about @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban: https://t.co/KYG7aJim5s #NoBanNoWall
*****************************
I’ll also be sharing the views of nonpartisan experts who are alarmed that this policy will harm our national security. #NoBanNoWall
*****************************
I’ll be sharing stories from people in MA terrified about what @realDonaldTrump’s executive action means for their loved ones. #NoBanNoWall
*****************************
Tonight @SenateDems will hold the floor as we speak out against @realDonaldTrump’s illegal &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban. #NoBanNoWall
*****************************
What a view tonight in front of the Supreme Court as Congressional Dems &amp; hundreds of people gathered to say #NoMuslimBan #NoBanNoWall. https://t.co/HPM8sFfIy4
*****************************
I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don’t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.
*****************************
Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
*****************************
If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg.
*****************************
You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?
*****************************
Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. There’s no other way to say it. https://t.co/lUsVQChRMd
*****************************
.@SenateDems brought victims of Mnuchin’s bank to DC when @GOPSenFinance refused to hear their stories. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
*****************************
Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than 60k families. That’s not up for debate. It’s fact.
*****************************
I told 20k+ ppl in MA: We'll fight in courts, Congress &amp; across America to stop Trump’s #MuslimBan. #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/NSKCnw13Sv
*****************************
Proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Mayor @marty_walsh, @SenMarkey, @CAIRMass &amp; 20k+ people in Boston today to say #NoBanNoWall. https://t.co/Uar90gJOa7
*****************************
We will not allow a Muslim ban in the United States of America. Here's what I said at Logan Airport tonight. #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/XqeS9Iy14e
*****************************
Tonight we fight for American values at airports all across this country. I'm at Logan Airport now to say: #nomuslimban #NoBanNoWall
*****************************
I urge @realDonaldTrump: embrace policies that reflect America’s core values &amp; protect our ntl security. Rescind this executive order now.
*****************************
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need.
*****************************
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
*****************************
The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists.
*****************************
We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
*****************************
Let’s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.
*****************************
Today, @realDonaldTrump closed the door on that little girl – &amp; so many others who are running for their lives.
*****************************
I thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash &amp; their little girl over to human smugglers.
*****************************
And I met a 7-yr-old girl – younger than my own granddaughters – who had been sent out on that perilous journey alone. https://t.co/00beGm7URo
*****************************
I saw the plastic pool floaties parents put on small children, hoping that would be enough to save them if the raft went down. https://t.co/C8HQpWIB11
*****************************
I saw the shoddy, paper-thin rubber rafts that people cram onto with a hope &amp; a prayer that they’ll make it across the choppy, rocky sea.
*****************************
15 months ago, I traveled to the Greek island of Lesvos – the 1st stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee the terrors of ISIS. https://t.co/Q02rbWqoWJ
*****************************
It’s hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous @USedgov nominee. The Senate should reject Betsy DeVos. https://t.co/KKWRr7HR1H
*****************************
I’ve heard from thousands of teachers, parents, &amp; ed leaders in MA with deep concerns about Betsy DeVos. I hear &amp; share their concerns.
*****************************
And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.
*****************************
Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
*****************************
I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible &amp; misguided pet political projects.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will hurt working parents &amp; children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence &amp; poverty.
*****************************
None of @realDonaldTrump’s actions today will make us safer. They’ll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong &amp; united.
*****************************
Why not just declare January 25th as the Trump Administration's First Anti-Immigrant Day?
*****************************

*****************************
If @RepMickMulvaney thinks the @CFPB is a "sad, sick joke," maybe he should spend more time talking to his constituents
*****************************
Those are just some of the dozens of constituents – including servicemembers &amp; seniors – who have gotten money back or other help from @CFPB
*****************************
Maybe @RepMickMulvaney should take a look at some of the complaints his constituents have filed with the @CFPB: https://t.co/E3gdLLbdMO
*****************************
Budget Director nominee @RepMickMulvaney said today he believes the @CFPB is a “sad, sick joke” and that he finds the agency “offensive”
*****************************
I’m glad the @CFPB is cleaning up student loan servicing and holding @Navient accountable. That’s why we need a strong consumer agency.
*****************************
There’s a reason why @Navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.
*****************************
Every time I tweet or post about @Navient, students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant.
*****************************
We all know @Navient has been caught red-handed cheating students and servicemembers before. https://t.co/BbkUbp8Olv
*****************************
Now the CEO of @Navient is whining to @washingtonpost about getting caught by the @CFPB. Give me a break. https://t.co/LGUIniffPj
*****************************
Last week, @CFPB, @ILAttyGeneral, &amp; @AGOWA all sued @Navient (fmr Sallie Mae) for cheating students. https://t.co/yM5LRlMQU0
*****************************
Perhaps @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP didn’t get the message Saturday: We’re not taking women’s rights back – not now, &amp; not ever.
*****************************
I’ve been a cosponsor of a bill to repeal the global gag rule. I’ll be 1st in line to cosponsor again when @SenatorShaheen reintroduces it.
*****************************
.@POTUS Trump is reinstating the “global gag rule” to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.
*****************************
Attacking @PPFA &amp; US women’s reproductive rights isn’t enough for @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP. Today they made their fight global.
*****************************
We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream.
*****************************
That’s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.
*****************************
.@POTUS suspended a planned cut in FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost 40k families a shot at a new home.
*****************************
Just minutes after taking the oath of office, @POTUS Trump made it harder for working families to get a mortgage. https://t.co/13ytYnmGpt
*****************************
Thank you for your terrific service, @JohnKerry. You’ve made MA proud, and we’re looking forward to having you back in the Commonwealth.
*****************************
Today at 1 ET, @SenateDems are hosting a forum with ppl who’d be hurt by Price’s health care policies. Watch live: https://t.co/Q6m4FyZNmi
*****************************
And yesterday at his @HHSgov hearing, Tom Price wouldn’t commit to protecting Medicare &amp; Medicaid from massive cuts. https://t.co/1NJ6dYCJK8
*****************************
Rep Tom Price - @realDonaldTrump’s pick to run @HHSgov - is the lead architect of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
*****************************
When Mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork, he asks for forgiveness. When his customers made mistakes, he took their homes.
*****************************
Heather McCreary lost her home when Mnuchin’s bank said she sent the wrong check with her complicated paperwork. https://t.co/k9OjA82Yfw
*****************************
Steve Mnuchin told @SenStabenow &amp; @SenatorMenendez he didn’t disclose $100M because “the amount of paperwork” was tough. Boo hoo.
*****************************
The people who broke our economy &amp; ruined people’s lives need to be held accountable. Not given the keys to break our economy again.
*****************************
No, @SenOrrinHatch, @POTUS didn’t force Mnuchin &amp; OneWest to lie to homeowners about modifications &amp; steal homes while making millions.
*****************************
.@SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes.
*****************************
.@SenOrrinHatch said Mnuchin's bank's disgraceful actions are "essentially unrelated" to his qualifications. Tell that to his victims.
*****************************
.@SenateDems held a forum to hear Mnuchin’s victims. While watching the @USTreasury hearing, remember Colleen. https://t.co/kc8ap1VIjV
*****************************
.@GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear Colleen – an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchin’s bank.
*****************************
Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that lied &amp; cheated people out of their homes. @GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear those stories today.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump should stand with working Americans &amp; uphold @POTUS’s protections. Read my new @CNN op-ed. https://t.co/gNozaRHTU1
*****************************
New protections making sure Americans are paid overtime &amp; aren’t exposed to deadly chemicals could turn to dust with @realDonaldTrump.
*****************************
Paid sick days, a higher min wage, &amp; discrimination-free hiring for federal contractors could go out the window with @realDonaldTrump.
*****************************
If @realDonaldTrump follows through on promises to “eliminate” or “repeal” @POTUS’s exec orders, workers could lose wages &amp; benefits Monday.
*****************************
Thank you, @SenRonJohnson. Dais or not, I hope more will watch the heartbreaking stories of Mnuchin’s victims. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
*****************************
If Rep Tom Price won’t commit to protecting 1 in 3 Americans’ health care, he’s not the right person to run @HHSgov.
*****************************
I asked @HHSgov nominee Price: Will you follow @realDonaldTrump’s promise for no Medicare/Medicaid cuts? (Nope.) https://t.co/7pC2c4YzSl
*****************************
.@HHSgov nominee Tom Price proposed a whopping $449 billion in Medicare cuts &amp; $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as chair of @housebudgetGOP.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump promised over &amp; over that he wouldn’t cut Medicare &amp; Medicaid, but his @HHSgov nominee won't make the same promise.
*****************************
OneWest Bank victims deserve to have their voices heard, so we invited them to share their stories. Tune in now: https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
*****************************
It will take a lot more than petty rearranging of furniture to stop @SenateDems from fighting for working families, @SenateGOP. Try again.
*****************************
But @SenRonJohnson ordered dais chairs removed from his empty room so Senators talking to victims couldn't sit in their usual spot. Really. https://t.co/DvmGvx9WDh
*****************************
3 hours before the Mnuchin victims’ forum was scheduled to start, @SenRonJohnson finally agreed that we could use his empty hearing room.
*****************************
Mnuchin's allies in Congress will do ANYTHING to protect @realDonaldTrump’s @USTreasury nominee &amp; please their Wall Street friends.
*****************************
So today at 2:15PM ET, we are holding a forum with OneWest Bank foreclosure victims. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
*****************************
25 Senators asked @SenOrrinHatch to hear from OneWest Bank foreclosure victims at Steve Mnuchin’s @USTreasury hearing. He refused.
*****************************
Tune in now to watch @HELPCmteDems’s confirmation hearing with Tom Price for @HHSgov secretary: https://t.co/Xto9jqdsBS
*****************************
I explained my concerns about Tom Price’s @HHSgov nomination in a 20-page letter yesterday. https://t.co/edaNYEBoWO
*****************************
Tom Price has also championed proposals to privatize Medicare &amp; radically restructure Medicaid – weakening our nation’s health care.
*****************************
Tom Price championed ACA repeal. He’s opposed improvements to women’s care. He’s cosponsored leg to discriminate against LGBT ppl.
*****************************
The job of @HHSgov sec is to “enhance &amp; protect the health…of all Americans.” I’m not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.
*****************************
If #BetsyDeVos won't use @usedgov’s many tools &amp; resources to save students from fraud, she shouldn't be the Secretary of Education.
*****************************
Tonight I asked #BetsyDeVos a set of q's about her education experience &amp; commitment to protect students. Watch: https://t.co/0euCIOKwAn
*****************************
In fact, #BetsyDeVos has no experience with student loans, Pell Grants, or public education at all.
*****************************
As @usedgov secretary, #BetsyDeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank. She has no experience doing that.
*****************************
I have 3 more rounds of q's that I would like to ask @usedgov nominee Betsy DeVos, @SenAlexander. I’m waiting. #1moreround #DeVosHearing
*****************************
Tune in live now to watch @HELPCmteDems’s confirmation hearing with Betsy DeVos for @usedgov secretary:  https://t.co/66BzPi6Ovd
*****************************
I raised my many concerns about @usedgov nominee Betsy DeVos in a 16-page letter to her last week. https://t.co/WAE1JCODir
*****************************
.@usedgov secretaries have served as teachers, school system leaders, governors – and Betsy DeVos has held no such position.
*****************************
There is no precedent for a @usedgov secretary with the lack of experience in public education that Betsy DeVos has.
*****************************

.@SenateDems &amp; I have asked @SenOrrinHatch to include outside witnesses for Mnuchin’s @USTreasury hearing. https://t.co/9kl5j5ScuY https://t.co/sOSIWL9Xx0
*****************************
If being “the Foreclosure King” qualifies Mnuchin for @USTreasury, we should hear from ppl with first-hand experience with his businesses.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump's @USTreasury pick Steve Mnuchin ran a bank infamous for aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosing on people’s homes.
*****************************
Rex Tillerson may try to dodge accountability in the US Senate – but @ExxonMobil certainly won’t dodge accountability from @MassAGO Healey.
*****************************
And the same day Tillerson dodged climate change q’s, @ExxonMobil must turn over climate change docs to @MassAGO. https://t.co/6YUW6BdR4S
*****************************
.@ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson had a bad day yesterday. Wouldn’t call out his pal Putin. Claimed Exxon didn’t lobby against sanctions (it did).
*****************************
The solution is clear: @realDonaldTrump must divest fully – putting his assets in a true blind trust. If he won't, Congress must require it.
*****************************
.@HUDgov grants &amp; loans must be about helping the American people ONLY – not @realDonaldTrump's personal fortune.
*****************************
Dr Carson danced around my q, because here’s the truth: He can’t promise it, b/c @realDonaldTrump won't eliminate his financial conflicts.
*****************************
I asked Ben Carson a simple q: Can you assure us no @HUDgov money will help @realDonaldTrump’s business empire? https://t.co/Q3Dh4lPVL0
*****************************
And if @realDonaldTrump won’t follow the Constitution, Congress must fight back every step of the way. https://t.co/wEG1wdljgO https://t.co/kNrsXY0JnY
*****************************
If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to make America great &amp; put America first, he’ll divest his assets by placing them in a true blind trust.
*****************************
The @OfficeGovEthics says he “[doesn’t] think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be @POTUS.” I don’t either. https://t.co/3i4PgapSOs
*****************************
The idea that @realDonaldTrump will still own massive business interests as @POTUS isn’t only unethical – it puts us all at risk.

In just a few min, we’ll talk with @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees workers about how Puzder’s companies treat workers. Watch: https://t.co/GTfV3Diadr
*****************************
In fact, @USDOL Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder seems to have little respect for American workers at all.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump’s pick to protect America’s workers is a fast food CEO whose burger chains have had numerous labor law violations.
*****************************
My colleagues &amp; I will host a forum today at 3pm to hear from @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees employees. I hope you’ll tune in. https://t.co/GTfV3Diadr
*****************************
.@SenAlexander refused our request to hear from Andrew Puzder’s employees at his confirmation hearing. https://t.co/tkxIcHZlCJ
*****************************
22 of my colleagues &amp; I urged @SenAlexander to hold a hearing with Puzder’s employees &amp; other outside witnesses. https://t.co/TvdrZiwq9K
*****************************
It’s essential for the HELP Committee to hear from Puzder’s employees to evaluate his qualifications &amp; suitability for @USDOL Secretary.
*****************************
If confirmed as @USDOL Secretary, Andrew Puzder would oversee enforcement of many labor laws that @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees reportedly violated.
*****************************
Andrew Puzder’s fast food chains have had numerous violations of wage protection laws &amp; several class action lawsuits by employees.
*****************************
If the @SenateGOP want to destroy health care in America, I will fight them every step of the way.
*****************************
Tonight I went to the Senate floor to tell the @SenateGOP: Repeal &amp; run of the ACA is for cowards. https://t.co/OrEYGlv7ES
*****************************
The @SenateGOP want to tear apart the ACA – rip health insurance out of the hands of millions of people who need it – &amp; repeal &amp; run.
*****************************
The @SenateGOP have spent 8 years complaining about health care reform. But after 8 years of complaining, they still don’t have a plan.

*****************************
Today @RepKClark, our Democratic colleagues &amp; I introduced the bill to implement the Emoluments Clause: https://t.co/wEG1wdljgO
*****************************
The only way for @realDonaldTrump to truly eliminate conflicts is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust.
*****************************
Americans STILL deserve to know that the President is doing what’s best for the country – not what’s best for himself &amp; his businesses.
*****************************
It’s been 25 days since @realDonaldTrump promised to outline his plans for the Trump empire. We’re still waiting.
*****************************
Cabinet officials must put our country's interests before their own. No conf hearings should be held until we’re certain that’s the case.
*****************************
This is ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump’s noms can’t drag their feet on ethics paperwork while their Senate friends try to run out the clock.
*****************************
.@OfficeGovEthics wrote back with “great concern” about the @SenateGOP’s confirmation hearings. https://t.co/YIC6e5TBSs
*****************************
Confirmation hearings start Tuesday, so @SenSchumer &amp; I asked @OfficeGovEthics how the ethics reviews are going. https://t.co/z04Vyhxx5b
*****************************
Confirmation hearings historically aren’t conducted until the @OfficeGovEthics certifies that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.
*****************************
The @SenateGOP are bypassing important steps to make sure these billionaire cabinet nominees are free of dangerous conflicts of interest.
*****************************

Tell us, @GOP: Who, exactly, thinks that the problem with Washington is that we have too many rules requiring the gov to act ethically?
*****************************
And now the @HouseGOP is gutting its ethics office in the middle of the night – hours before the new Congress is sworn in.
*****************************
Trump’s cabinet of billionaires &amp; CEOs have ignored gov ethics rules &amp; dragged their feet on FBI background checks &amp; financial disclosures.

*****************************
.@usedgov plans to forgive student loans for people with severe disabilities – but @USTreasury wants to stick them with a giant tax bill.
*****************************
387k Social Security recipients are struggling to pay student loans but have been diagnosed with a disability so severe they can’t work.
*****************************
Every nominee must follow the law before they are confirmed – even rich ones who think the rules don't apply. https://t.co/DwCczwAcu9
*****************************
If President-elect @realDonaldTrump's cabinet nominees ignore the ethics rules, it's a recipe for corruption. https://t.co/eMPhPZRm4k

Appointing Andrew Puzder to run the agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hard-working American family.
*****************************
Andrew Puzder plotted to replace his workers with machines because they are "always polite" &amp; "never take a vacation."
*****************************
Andrew Puzder looks down on working people. At @Hardees &amp; @CarlsJr, he got rich squeezing front-line workers on wages, overtime &amp; benefits.

I’ll keep fighting to implement the good policies in #CuresAct, repeal the giveaways, &amp; hold Congress accountable for NIH &amp; opioid funding.
*****************************
But I believe the final 21st Century #CuresAct still failed to live up to the standards we should expect from our Congress.
*****************************
We also got a ridiculous provision removed from the #CuresAct that would let drug companies hide kickbacks to doctors &amp; hospitals.
*****************************
By fighting back, we changed a #CuresAct provision that would let @realDonaldTrump decide opioid spending. Now MA should get its fair share.
*****************************
Republicans also broke their promise in the #CuresAct to meaningfully boost guaranteed funding for NIH and the opioid crisis.
*****************************
Republicans concluded that bipartisan medical innovation in the #CuresAct would require a raft of giveaways to giant drug companies.
*****************************
I’m glad that many good provisions in the #CuresAct will become law, but I’m disappointed by the price we paid for the GOP to pass the bill.
*****************************
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision reducing the admin burden at NIH to ensure more efficient spending of fed research money.
*****************************
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision ensuring the meaningful inclusion of women &amp; minorities in clinical trials.
*****************************
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision supporting the development of genetically-targeted therapies for people with rare diseases.

So will you keep your promise to protect Medicare &amp; Medicaid, @realDonaldTrump? My colleagues &amp; I want to know: https://t.co/PtyEAZL1HP
*****************************
But the election is over, @realDonaldTrump, &amp; now you’re shifting to support changes that would gut Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
*****************************
During your presidential campaign, @realDonaldTrump, you promised you were the only Republican who would protect Medicare &amp; Medicaid.

Trump, Mnuchin &amp; @HouseGOP may be willing to gamble w/ our economy, but @HouseDemocrats should side with ppl who want tougher Wall St rules.
*****************************
Steve Mnuchin would get to decide how to regulate 30 of our biggest banks – including the bank where he currently serves as board member.
*****************************
HR 6392 would take power away from independent regulators &amp; give it to @realDonaldTrump’s choice for Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin.
*****************************
The banks cut loose by HR 6392 are the same size as the banks that helped bring down the economy in 2008. What could possibly go wrong?!
*****************************
.@HouseGOP aren’t waiting for @realDonaldTrump to roll back Wall St reform. HR 6392 guts Dodd-Frank rules for 30 of the biggest banks.

21st Century Cures still doesn’t do nearly enough to help generate real cures for Alzheimer’s, diabetes, cancer, &amp; other deadly diseases.
*****************************
21st Century Cures no longer lets drug companies hide kickbacks to doctors, but it still lets drug companies get away with fraud.
*****************************
Since the public got wind of the Big Pharma giveaways &amp; Congress started feeling the heat, 21st Century Cures has changed a little.

Every good proposal in the Cures Act will die unless Democrats help drug companies commit fraud, give out kickbacks, &amp; put patients at risk.

It is totally unprecedented for a President-elect of the United States to have to settle fraud lawsuits before taking office.

.@realDonaldTrump just paid $25 million for breaking the law &amp; ripping off students. https://t.co/G73gPNd7lS

*****************************
Today, a new GOP Senate must decide whether self-interest &amp; political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right.
*****************************
30 yrs ago, a GOP Senate rejected @SenatorSessions’ judicial nomination, affirming no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate.
*****************************
If @realDonaldTrump refuses to reverse on @SenatorSessions, it falls on the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation.

Instead of embracing the bigotry of his rallies, I urge @realDonaldTrump to reverse his decision to nominate @SenatorSessions for AG.

*****************************
Today I told a room full of CEOs at the #WSJCEOCouncil: Nobody wants them to keep running the gov for themselves. https://t.co/PhyLkxE4dn
*****************************
Keeping these lobbyists &amp; insiders on your team sends a clear message, @realDonaldTrump: your campaign was a giant con.
*****************************
You already broke your promise, @realDonaldTrump. You stacked your transition team with Wall Street elites, insiders &amp; lobbyists.
*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump, you promised the American people you’d #draintheswamp of lobbyists &amp; insiders rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful.
*****************************
The President of the United States should condemn bigots, @realDonaldTrump. Not give them a West Wing office to decide our country's future.
*****************************
Steve Bannon promoted white nationalism, @realDonaldTrump. He's been praised by KKK supporters &amp; denounced by @splcenter &amp; @ADL_National .
*****************************
Tell us, @realDonaldTrump: You said you'd be a "President for all." Then why are you embracing the ugliness &amp; divisiveness of your campaign?
*****************************
Let me be clear: It's foolish for any Dem to think that weakening support for the @CFPB is good for the country or good for us as a party.
*****************************
Anyone in Congress – GOP or Dem – who votes to weaken the @CFPB will declare loud &amp; clear they represent giant banks, not working families.
*****************************
The @CFPB has returned over $11 BILLION to consumers who have been cheated by big banks &amp; financial institutions.
*****************************
If I were Wall Street &amp; the GOP, I’d be scared too: The @CFPB goes after big banks like @WellsFargo when they break the law.
*****************************
The real reason Wall St &amp; their @GOP allies are going after the @CFPB is because it’s working too darn well for consumers &amp; must be stopped.
*****************************
You’re going to hear a lot of reasons why we must make these changes to the @CFPB. Not one of them is going to be true.
*****************************
It’s only been a few days since the election &amp; Wall St banks &amp; their @GOP friends are already licking their chops to undercut the @CFPB.
*****************************
And @FCC should ban unreasonable pay-for-privacy schemes that coerce consumers to give up #privacy for discounts. https://t.co/CG8MNN9LcJ

*****************************
.@RepDuckworth &amp; I introduced the #SAVEBenefits Act to give 70M Americans a one-time 3.9% Social Security payment. There's still time.
*****************************
Today the @SocialSecurity Admin announced a 0.3% COLA for 2017. For many Americans struggling to make ends meet, that offers little relief.
*****************************
The SEC needs new leadership to return to its mission to protect investors. @POTUS should use his authority to designate a new chair today
*****************************
SEC Chair White has refused to advance a rule to require public corporations to disclose political spending despite broad bipartisan support
*****************************
But under Chair White the SEC routinely ignores needs of investors to cater to interests of big businesses, dragging its feet on key rules
*****************************
The SEC has a simple purpose: to protect investors by ensuring they have the information they need to make decisions
*****************************
Today I asked @POTUS to immediately designate a new Chair of the SEC to replace Mary Jo White: https://t.co/Jin8kvpbZ5
*****************************
I am heartsick for the 2 brave @bostonpolice officers shot in Boston, their families &amp; the entire BPD. Our gratitude &amp; prayers are with you.

A bank teller would face criminal charges &amp; a prison sentence for stealing a handful of 20s from the cash drawer.
*****************************
If @WellsFargo’s John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions, that's still not real accountability.
*****************************
As I said: @WellsFargo CEO Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made during the scam, &amp; face DOJ/SEC investigation. He’s 1 for 3.

If this unelected Board wants Puerto Rico to believe it takes their crisis seriously, they can start by leaving NY. Start by showing up.

I guess holding the mtg in Puerto Rico would've been inconvenient. 20,000+ Zika cases. Recent blackouts left 1M w/o power. 340k w/o water.
*****************************
Will this Board speak for the ppl of Puerto Rico or the bankers? Today it met for the first time - not in PR, but NYC. That's a bad start.

It’s time for @usedgov's student loan bank to prove they care more about Corinthian’s victims than their own bottom line.
*****************************
Today I wrote to @usedgov demanding their student loan bank halt collection of Corinthian students’ debt: https://t.co/qk6LpjPfeP
*****************************
That means Corinthian’s victims eligible for loan forgiveness are instead having tax refunds, EITC &amp; Social Security garnished. It’s absurd.
*****************************
We uncovered data that instead of simply discharging the loans of Corinthian’s victims, @usedgov pushed 80k of them to debt collectors.
*****************************
Corinthian Colleges went belly up amid findings that it defrauded students. Under fed law, those students are eligible for loan discharge.
*****************************
That’s the @GOP agenda in a nutshell: Pay Congress to do nothing, &amp; block back-breaking Americans from getting paid for a hard day’s work.
*****************************
Last night @HouseGOP voted to delay our new overtime rule by 6 months. Kill a simple rule that hard-working people deserve to get paid.
*****************************
.@SpeakerRyan’s Congress is on track to work the fewest days in decades. But what did they do last night before leaving town until November?
*****************************
Deepest sympathies for the family of Shimon Peres on the passing of a dedicated public servant with an enduring commitment to peace.
*****************************
As I said last week: Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was ongoing, &amp; face SEC &amp; DOJ investigations.
*****************************
.@WellsFargo CEO Stumpf will be just fine: he keeps his job &amp; most of the money he made while massive fraud went on under his nose.
*****************************
.@WellsFargo employees who tried to sound the alarm about the creation of fake accounts were fired. Their lives turned upside down.
*****************************
.@WellsFargo employees who failed to meet management's outrageous sales goals were fired.

If @SenateGOP seriously think they can hold the gov hostage to protect political corruption w/o anyone noticing, they'd better think again.
*****************************
Every agency w/ jurisdiction should follow @USDOL's lead &amp; determine whether @WellsFargo &amp; its senior execs should be prosecuted/sanctioned.

Congress must do more to reform higher ed accreditation, so I introduced a bill w/ @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenBrianSchatz: https://t.co/33bV95cRNF
*****************************
.@usedgov did the right thing today to protect students &amp; taxpayers by stripping ACICS of its college accreditation power.
*****************************
Corinthian &amp; ITT Tech committed fraud to drown students in debt with useless degrees, but ACICS accredited both when they filed bankruptcy.
*****************************
College accreditation is supposed to make sure kids get a good education while colleges take taxpayer money. But the system is broken.
*****************************
.@SenateGOP has billions of reasons to defend this rotten system - but we're sick of it &amp; ready to fight. https://t.co/acTsbKkKU4
*****************************
If @SenateMajLdr thinks he can hold the whole government hostage to shield donors buying off politicians, think again.
*****************************
We know why - billions in secret dark money is flowing into our political system, to prop up @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies in Congress.
*****************************
But here we go again - Republicans are threatening to shut down the gov in days unless we ban disclosure of corporate political spending.
*****************************
Shutting down the government isn't very popular with the American people. You'd think the Republicans would've learned that by now.

*****************************
.@WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf should resign, give back the money he took while the scam was going on, &amp; be criminally investigated.
*****************************
A bank cashier who steals $20 would be facing theft charges, but Wall St execs never hold themselves accountable. Not in 2008 &amp; not now.
*****************************
We know @WellsFargo’s Board knew of exec Carrie Tolstedt’s misconduct, but she’ll still retire with a huge payout: https://t.co/leTA3jL4we

.@WellsFargo’s definition of “accountable” is to push blame on low-level employees who don’t have money or PR firms to defend themselves.

The @CFPB caught @WellsFargo in a massive, years-long scam. CEO John Stumpf hasn’t resigned. He hasn’t fired 1 senior executive.

*****************************
We don't know what @realDonaldTrump is hiding in his taxes. What new tax scams he's running. Which foreign dictators have him on the take.
*****************************
Every major party Presidential candidate should release their tax returns. And they all do – except @realDonaldTrump. He's just too chicken.

*****************************
Not one of the people or corporations referred to @TheJusticeDept by the FCIC has been criminally prosecuted. That’s an abysmal failure.

Heading to the Senate floor now to tell the @SenateGOP: #DoYourJob &amp; give judicial nominees a vote. Watch: https://t.co/h7zRAFfpKr
*****************************
Now it’s time to focus on helping @ITTTech students – the real victims – get their loans cancelled or finish programs at schools that care.
*****************************
.@usedgov took the right step a few weeks ago when they banned @ITTTech from enrolling new students with federal student loan money.
*****************************
The only people responsible for @ITTTech’s collapse are their execs who sucked students in with thousands in debt &amp; useless degrees.
*****************************
#Zika funding isn’t a place for your selfish, partisan games, @SenateGOP. People’s lives are at risk. Bring a clean bill to a vote NOW.
*****************************
After a 7-wk @GOP recess, the @SenateGOP's 1st priority is the same old #Zika bill that hurts women, vets, Obamacare, @PPFA &amp; clean water.
*****************************
19 of my @SenateDems colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to Mylan for answers about the EpiPen price hike: https://t.co/Q3q1yTinBN
*****************************
Mylan’s promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.
*****************************
Mylan’s expanded patient assistance programs are an industry game to keep EpiPen costs high for insurance companies, the gov &amp; employers.
*****************************
I have serious concerns about pharmaceutical giant Mylan’s significant price hikes for the life-saving EpiPen Auto-Injector.
*****************************
.@ITTTech's free ride is finally over &amp; the message is clear: We won't stand by &amp; allow these shady schools to cheat students &amp; taxpayers.
*****************************
Today, @usedgov has finally said enough is enough, banning @ITTTech from enrolling any new students with federal dollars this fall.
*****************************
The SEC, @CFPB, &amp; @MassAGO are all suing @ITTTech for fraud &amp; they failed, again, to meet the low standards of their accrediting agency.
*****************************
.@ITTTech – a massive, for-profit college – is currently under investigation by 20 state &amp; federal agencies for cheating students.
*****************************
Great news: @TheJusticeDept will end its use of ineffective &amp; dangerous private prisons - 1 step to fix our broken criminal justice system.
*****************************
.@HUDgov guidance will send a clear message that housing-related ordinances must protect vulnerable individuals – not leave them homeless.
*****************************
I joined 28 @SenateDems urging @HUDgov to explain how nuisance ordinances may violate fed law. https://t.co/aIWPyQFR83
*****************************
Domestic violence survivors, crime victims, &amp; others should never have to pick between calling 911 &amp; keeping a roof over their heads.
*****************************
.@usedgov didn’t fall for the scheme. To other shady #4profit schools, @JohnKingatED's right: Don’t waste your time. https://t.co/sPqrPE3HDJ
*****************************
A Utah-based #4profit college tried to convert to a bogus nonprofit school to skirt @usedgov for-profit rules &amp; oversight. Lame trick.

*****************************
Bad news: @DEAHQ refused to reschedule marijuana. This has wide implications for med research, law enforcement &amp; business.

Good news: @DEAHQ is eliminating outdated barriers to marijuana research. Common sense given growing pool of med marijuana patients.

Charles Koch, who secretly spends millions to shred candidates and orgs he opposes, is worried that open debate is under attack. Really?!
*****************************
.@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.
*****************************
Every MA delegation member signed a letter to @LamarSmithTX21 w/ concerns about this disgraceful pander to Big Oil. https://t.co/fUl9DZ1liu
*****************************
GOP says @MassAGO’s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies don’t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.
*****************************
We haven't found another example – not one – of a House committee subpoenaing a STATE AG's investigation of potential STATE law violations.
*****************************
The @HouseGOP claims to be for states’ rights, but they don’t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law.
*****************************
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman— a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
*****************************
The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.
*****************************
Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53Hk
*****************************
Yesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5
*****************************
Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG.
*****************************
This is an outrageous abuse of Congressional subpoena power to threaten a state AG and help a campaign contributor.
*****************************
For the @GOP, states’ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women’s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud.
*****************************
.@LamarSmithTX21 says he “takes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitution” — but apparently not the 10th Amendment.
*****************************
Yup, that’s right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AG’s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law.
*****************************
Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee — a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas — to subpoena @MassAGO.
*****************************
First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because she’s doing her job.
*****************************
.@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.
*****************************
Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.
*****************************
Heartsick for the families of the Baton Rouge police officers killed today. More violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.
*****************************
The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount https://t.co/kAUI4UG4pS
*****************************
We need our gov agencies to work together to warn students, veterans &amp; families about other unlicensed “universities” like Trump “U.”
*****************************
11 Senate Dems &amp; I sent a letter to @usedgov, @FTC, @CFPB &amp; @DeptVetAffairs about fake schools like Trump “U”: https://t.co/HqofUVw95d
*****************************
Trump U violated NY law by calling itself a "university" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme.
*****************************
The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
*****************************
The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples.
*****************************
Marriage equality is the law of the land. But #LGBT Americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.
*****************************
I’m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.
*****************************
Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
*****************************
I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but I know this: change must come. It must come now.
*****************************
I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.
*****************************
I’m sick at heart for the families of the officers killed in Dallas. Sick at heart for the families of the men shot in LA &amp; MN.
*****************************
Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities.
*****************************
No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those we’ve already  lost.
*****************************
#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.
*****************************
We can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to “survive” the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmatter
*****************************
Most cops are good ppl. But we can’t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to “survive” police. #blacklivesmatter

*****************************
#Zika isn't just coming. It's here. If the GOP won’t take it seriously, they must accept responsibility for the devastating consequences.
*****************************
Every day @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP don't take #Zika seriously, more ppl get sick. 481 pregnant women in US states &amp; territories have Zika NOW.
*****************************
Is this some sort of sick joke, @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus — and our country’s response to this emergency — just a game to you?!
*****************************
I didn’t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, PP, AND clean water all at once – but they did it. #Zika
*****************************
The GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M – money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.
*****************************
The GOP #Zika bill rolls back Clean Water Act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of Americans’ drinking water.
*****************************
The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
*****************************
The GOP #Zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.
*****************************
The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund, even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak.
*****************************
The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.
*****************************
Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am.
*****************************
4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act – and the GOP dragged their feet.
*****************************
My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP just tried to pass.
*****************************
.@SpeakerRyan &amp; the @HouseGOP: You should be ashamed of yourselves for your totally corrupt priorities. People are watching.
*****************************
.@HouseDemocrats: Please vote NO on this veto override. We weren’t sent here to do dirty work for Wall St’s armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.
*****************************
When @SpeakerRyan turns off the cameras, the @HouseGOP gets to work — both for the @NRA AND for Wall Street. Unbelievable.
*****************************
.@SpeakerRyan scheduled a vote tonight to kill a new @USDOL rule that protects workers’ retirement savings from shady financial advisers.
*****************************
After a whole day of #NoBillNoBreak, @HouseGOP is instead moving on a vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl. Really.

Congress wasn’t elected to help predatory lenders. If anyone tries to block or delay the @CFPB payday rules, it’s time to fight back hard.

Payday lending is a $7B/yr industry. That buys a lot of influence in Congress – not just with the GOP, but also some Democrats.
*****************************
The proposed payday lending rule isn’t perfect – it could do more – but the payday industry is already firing back.

The @CFPB’s new rule cracks down on tricks payday lenders use to generate thousands in interest &amp; fees from ppl trapped in cycles of debt.

Read our new report w/ workers in all 50 states saying what new overtime rules would mean to them: https://t.co/R28FjGtX0f #overdueOT
*****************************
Updating our outdated overtime rules is about economics, but it’s also about our values. #overdueOT https://t.co/gSTl95EhMu
*****************************
If we raise the overtime threshold, millions of people – including 281k in MA – will qualify for OT. #overdueOT https://t.co/QZHWaogdW9
*****************************
.@USDOL proposed a strong new rule to close the overtime loophole &amp; ensure a hard day’s work is rewarded with a fair day’s pay. #overdueOT
*****************************
Fast food workers, janitors, grocery clerks – anyone is called a "manager" to avoid overtime. It’s crazy. #overdueOT https://t.co/eXhPqO5RzL
*****************************
Employers can abuse a loophole by classifying anyone making over $23k/yr as a manager to avoid OT pay. #overdueOT https://t.co/W8gDoxNpY2
*****************************
Only 8% of salaried workers qualify for guaranteed overtime pay because the rules are so old. #overdueOT
*****************************
Thank you @RepStephenLynch &amp; @SenMarkey for your leadership, &amp; Rolling Thunder for your hard work to get our POW/MIA bill passed &amp; signed.
*****************************
I’m glad that @POTUS signed into law my bipartisan Ntl POW/MIA Remembrance Act to place a commemorative POW/MIA chair in the US Capitol.

*****************************
Now we have a real, genuine health crisis in America — the #Zika virus — and the @SenateGOP have done nothing but get ready for vacation.

*****************************
Read my letter to Chair Mary Jo White about my serious concerns with the SEC: https://t.co/8CHbzCAIpH
*****************************
This decision is a mockery of the SEC's core mission &amp; the latest example of the SEC failing to punish guilty parties &amp; protect investors.
*****************************
Just 2 months after Cohen's sanction, the SEC approved the application of a new investment firm co-owned by… Steven Cohen. Seriously.
*****************************
SAC Capital pled guilty to insider trading in 2013. In Jan, the SEC barred its manager Steven Cohen from managing outside funds until 2018.
*****************************
Wall St broke our economy — not Central States Pension Fund workers. @USTreasury should reject their pension cuts. https://t.co/G5vMtGGfe2
*****************************
In 2008, Wall Street got a bailout. What did those truck drivers, dockworkers &amp; warehouse workers get? They got stuck with bill.
*****************************
Goldman Sachs &amp; Northern Trust got $41M to manage workers’ pension funds, &amp; they recklessly gambled it on junk bonds &amp; toxic mortgages.

It’s time for the @SenateGOP to #doyourjob &amp; hold hearings, consider his nomination in good faith, &amp; give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote.

Pleased to meet today with Chief Judge Garland, @POTUS’s impressive nominee to serve on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/PuSNauAkWE
*****************************
That’s the definition of “unbelievable” in the real world – but it’s business as usual in the cozy world of Wall Street.
*****************************
“Unbelievable”? Yes, totally unbelievable that JPM could get tagged as TBTF &amp; then pat each other on the backs &amp; say “heckuva job.”
*****************************
Federal regulators said this week that JPMorgan is still Too Big to Fail. CEO Jamie Dimon's reaction? https://t.co/wye5It2fYH
*****************************
Today, our top regulators warned us about the danger of the biggest banks. We would be foolish to ignore their warnings.
*****************************
This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.
*****************************
No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks.
*****************************
Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.
*****************************
The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.
*****************************
There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.
*****************************
Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.
*****************************
Unless the banks promptly address regulators’ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex.
*****************************
5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren’t bailed out. It’s a very big deal. It’s scary.
*****************************
Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. https://t.co/zZNeA8HjrN
*****************************
The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: https://t.co/knv4GUBu8G
*****************************
And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.
*****************************
The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.
*****************************
It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.
*****************************
My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.
*****************************
Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.
*****************************
Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.
*****************************
This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services.
*****************************
Read my office’s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: https://t.co/wXXrLh60T7
*****************************
That means taxpayers have to spend billions – and share personal info with 3rd-parties – just to file taxes.
*****************************
The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.
*****************************
We recognize #EqualPayDay - &amp; we fight so we don’t have to recognize it again. Watch: https://t.co/1zwmmY1oFp

Remember: Paying off your student loans &amp; getting out of debt is an investment in your future too. #SaveYourSavings
*****************************
.@CoryBooker And count dollars, not just pennies. Find ways to save on big-ticket budget items like rent &amp; transportation. #SaveYourSavings
*****************************
Most people assume that. It explains why ppl lose $17B/yr trusting retirement advisers. #SaveYourSavings https://t.co/yhqDMBayOK
*****************************
Conflict of interest rules existed for doctors &amp; lawyers, but not retirement advisers. It's nuts! #SaveYourSavings  https://t.co/QqqV2KszW5

It’s past time for @usedgov’s bank to start running the student loan program to benefit students, not companies like Navient. #studentdebt
*****************************
Instead of holding Navient accountable, @usedgov’s student loan bank covered for them. Outrageous, but not surprising. #studentdebt

Navient, one of the biggest student loan servicers, got caught cheating American soldiers on student loans. #studentdebt

*****************************
.@Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting @POTUS’s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly.

At the same time they’re blocking any SCOTUS nominee, @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.

The @CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the @CFPB, not sabotage it.
*****************************
Until the @CFPB, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.

2.5 million households borrow from payday lenders each year, with more storefronts in the US than McDonald’s and Starbucks combined.

*****************************
The @CFTC committee’s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.
*****************************
The @CFTC report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.
*****************************
The advisory committee behind this compromised @CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders – violating Dodd-Frank.
*****************************
Today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the @CFTC’s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.

Under Dodd-Frank, Congress directed the @CFTC to establish the EEMAC – an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.

Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that – empty talk.
*****************************
The Senate GOP took an oath just like Dems did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution &amp; our democracy.
*****************************
I can’t find a clause in the Constitution that says “…except when there’s a year left in the term of a Democratic President.”
*****************************
Art II Sec 2 of the Constitution says the President nominates Supreme Court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate.
*****************************
.@SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact, they did: when @POTUS won in 2012.

*****************************
Heading into an election, it'd be easy for Congress to pass some small bills, declare victory &amp; quit. But that's not good enough.
*****************************
Last yr, @newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem “takes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.” I agree.
*****************************
Big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. Instead of funding that research, Congress has spent a decade choking off support.
*****************************
The Senate HELP Committee approved bills today to advance US medical innovation. I voted for those bills - but it isn't enough.

If we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen’s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: https://t.co/sm3QxIsEFA
*****************************
Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.
*****************************
Tell Congress: They work for the American people — not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.
*****************************
You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
*****************************
Nope — right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.
*****************************
You’d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?
*****************************
Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis – but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.
*****************************
If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.
*****************************
Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: https://t.co/NWX8Et2hqA
*****************************
The American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits – and they didn’t send us here to help the bandits.
*****************************
Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow, the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
*****************************
It’s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.

Congress will have to vote straight up or down on #TPP.  We won’t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like ISDS.
*****************************
A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS.

12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.

*****************************
Presidents don’t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference.
*****************************
Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all.

Very glad to speak to @ShuttleCDRKelly today about ways we can keep fighting to #StopGunViolence in America. https://t.co/DskXFUE3UB
*****************************
This #KeystoneXL lawsuit shows: ISDS was a bad idea for NAFTA, and it’s a bad idea for TPP. https://t.co/JgmCXPEge8
*****************************
I strongly support @POTUS’s action to #stopgunviolence. If Congress won’t step up to keep our kids safe, somebody else needs to start.
*****************************
Gun violence is an epidemic. But day after day, tragedy after tragedy, the GOP has blocked even the smallest steps to #stopgunviolence.

They're trying to tack rollbacks on leg like the funding bill Congress must pass next wk to prevent a gov shutdown. It's cynical &amp; corrupt.
