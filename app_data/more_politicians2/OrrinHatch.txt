A quick refresher of GOP gains in 2010 under @MichaelSteele:

✅ Control of the House with 63 House seats (biggest pickup since 1938) 
✅ 6 Senate seats
✅ 7 governorships
✅ The greatest share of state leg. seats since 1928 (600+)
*****************************
No, we elected @MichaelSteele because of his vision for our party and his ability as a leader, which he proved immediately in the historically successful 2010 midterms. Any suggestion to the contrary is embarrassingly misinformed.

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise: the individual mandate is a tax, and it overwhelmingly falls on lower and middle-income families.
