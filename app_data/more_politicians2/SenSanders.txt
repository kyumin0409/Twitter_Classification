It is grossly unfair for millions of workers in this country to be earning starvation wages, while the companies they work for make billions in profits and pay their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages.

The Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.

- Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B
- Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B
- Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B
- Defense increases since 9/11: $156 B

Without tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS.

Trump is right that it would be useful to take a serious look at the Postal Service. He's dead wrong, however, if he believes the solution is to privatize the Postal Service.

This is an issue that impacts virtually every American. The American people have a right to know how companies are profiting from our information.

This nation needs a serious conversation about the proper role of these companies. Should Facebook, Google and Amazon be allowed to control so much of the internet? How do ordinary citizens benefit from the internet without seeing an invasion of their personal lives?

Companies today know every aspect of a person’s life—where they go, what they do, their medical and financial records, whom they talk to, what they buy—and use that information to make billions in profit.

Let us never forget that at the time of his death Martin Luther King was organizing a multi-racial Poor People's Campaign and that he was assassinated in Memphis as he supported sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions.
*****************************
I'll join civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Dr. King was not only one of the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was also at the forefront of the fight for economic justice.

Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains a humanitarian disaster. The U.S. must play a more positive role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all.

The killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic. It is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response.

How absurd is it that we live in a country where Congress and many states give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, but fail to provide adequate funding for education?

It was true in 1993 and it is true now: the time is long, long overdue for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and have a universal health care system. https://t.co/wN7ayIWbeB
*****************************
And after providing a massive tax break for the wealthy that will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, Trump complains about the domestic spending initiatives secured by the Democratic Caucus to address the needs of working families and the middle class.
*****************************
After rescinding the DACA program in September and opposing every piece of legislation to help the Dreamers, Trump blames Democrats for a problem that he created.
*****************************
This was probably one of the most bizarre press conferences a president has ever had. Trump's hypocrisy and ignorance is no longer laughable. It is frightening. https://t.co/EIKu0SyW4P
*****************************
The American people are tired of our broken health care system. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans know that we can do better and that we should pass Medicare for all to finally make health care a right. https://t.co/YlDIEWjFJI
*****************************
John Bolton was part of the effort to mislead the US into the disastrous Iraq war and has supported military action against North Korea and Iran. He was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.

The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help.
*****************************
I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences.
*****************************
6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity – in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
*****************************
The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse.
*****************************
LBJ’s administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War. 

Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth.
*****************************
The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
*****************************
Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
*****************************
So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen:
-Over 10,000 civilians have been killed
-Over 3 million have been displaced
-15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation
-More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported
*****************************
I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked “Made in the USA," dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military.
*****************************
The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war.

5) Finally, we must make it easier for law enforcement to keep guns away from those accused of domestic violence or under a restraining order.
*****************************
4) We need to provide more resources for those with mental health issues and make it harder for people with red flags to obtain weapons. People who are suffering from a mental health crisis should be able to get the health care they need.
*****************************
3) We should reinstate the ban on assault weapons in this country—weapons which are designed for no other purpose but to kill human beings.
*****************************
2) We must crack down on "straw men" purchasers, when people legally buy guns and then sell them to people who cannot get them legally.
*****************************
1) We must seriously strengthen universal background checks, including ending the gun show loophole. Background checks don't mean anything if somebody can go into a gun show or the internet and buy weapons without undergoing any background check.
*****************************
The American people are demanding that we have the courage to stand up to the NRA and finally take some action to move us in the right direction on gun safety. Let me suggest some of the ways in which I believe we should go forward in a bipartisan way.

If you were wondering how Trump plans to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires and corporations, now you know: with $1.8 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
*****************************
Instead of creating more giveaways to corporate America, we should be eliminating corporate tax loopholes and using this revenue to directly invest over $1 trillion to modernize our nation’s infrastructure and create 15 million good-paying jobs.
*****************************
Trump is right to talk about the need to rebuild our infrastructure, but his proposal is dead wrong. Trump would encourage states to sell our nation’s highways, bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street and saddle Americans with new tolls and fees.
*****************************
The Trump budget is morally bankrupt and bad economic policy. It pays for his tax breaks for the rich and large corporations by slashing Medicaid by $1.3 trillion, cutting Medicare by $554 billion and slicing $10 billion from the Social Security Disability Insurance Program.

Second, the $165 billion increase in defense spending is much too large. I believe in a strong military, but at a time when the U.S. spends more on defense than the next 12 countries combined, the last thing we should do is massively increase the Pentagon’s budget.

Thank you to the 1.1 million people who tuned in live to the first-ever national Medicare for All town hall tonight. Together we will successfully move the United States to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system and guarantee health care to all.

We are not going to win this fight unless all of us are actively involved, stand up, fight back and recognize that health care is a right, not a privilege. #MedicareForAll

Toronto physician Dr. Danyaal Raza explains that having a single payer system does not mean having a lower quality system. Canada has longer life expectancy than in the U.S. and better health outcomes. #MedicareForAll

What would it mean for your family if health care was guaranteed to all as a right? #MedicareForAll

We need a health care system where people who are sick do not put off going to the doctor because they cannot afford it. #MedicareForAll

Here is why I voted against Republicans' short-term spending bill today: https://t.co/eseafECZ3Q
*****************************
Enough is enough. The Republican Party controls the House, Senate and White House. They have got to govern, not ignore the major crises facing this country.
*****************************
We're talking about the need to provide adequate disaster relief for the people of Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico – an island where hundreds of thousands are still without electricity.
*****************************
We 're talking about many thousands of people with disabilities who will die because they couldn't get their claims processed in a timely manner by an underfunded and understaffed Social Security Administration.
*****************************
We're talking about 27 million Americans who will find it harder and harder to get their health care through community health centers because that program has not yet been reauthorized.
*****************************
We're talking about the fate of 800,000 Dreamers who have lived here almost all of their lives, but could soon be faced with deportation if we don't act now.
*****************************
The reason I voted against today’s continuing resolution is simple: tens of millions of lives are at stake. We must act NOW, not kick the can down the road.
*****************************
Did you know that universal health care systems like Canada's are less expensive than the wasteful, bureaucratic system in America? https://t.co/07COIe64DM

*****************************
Republicans: 
✅  Control the House
✅  Control the Senate
✅  Control the presidency 

Do your job. Run the damn government. Pass a budget that protects working families.
*****************************
Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. The most fundamental responsibility of the governing party is to govern. I say to Republicans: Do your job.
*****************************
We asked Republicans to pass a budget that would protect the needs of working families. They preferred to shut down the government instead.
*****************************
When it comes to providing tax breaks to billionaires, Republicans will rush to get it done.

When it comes to passing a budget that protects the needs of working families—well, we are still waiting.
*****************************
Mitch McConnell is many things but he’s not dumb. He knows how to count. Bringing up a vote he knew was doomed an hour before the government shut down was absolutely irresponsible. This falls on his shoulders.

For the first time in history, a one-party government was unable to keep the government going. That is pathetic. https://t.co/hRlzNzQBxJ

Republicans can't negotiate an agreement on what 87 percent of Americans agree on. That is where we are right now. https://t.co/bL1joqFmOG
*****************************
I hope, based on last night's vote, that McConnell now changes his mind and begins to negotiate seriously. We must reopen the government as soon as possible.
*****************************
I'm very disappointed that the Republicans chose to shut down the government. Leader McConnell insisted on going forward with a doomed vote rather than negotiating a serious agreement with the Democrats and Republicans who opposed him.

You cannot run a government on a month-to-month basis. We cannot continue to abdicate our responsibility. We must address the problems facing the American people.
*****************************
This morning I say to Senator McConnell: Please do not shut the government down. Sit down with the Democrats and start negotiating a compromise agreement.
*****************************
Today I urge, in the strongest possible terms, that the Republican leadership in the Senate accept its responsibility and not allow the government to shut down. https://t.co/Dp2zRwXxoI https://t.co/XD0ockRgI7

*****************************
It does not take great moral courage to pass an issue that nearly 9 in 10 Americans agree on – to allow DACA recipients to stay in the only country they have ever known and have a pathway to citizenship. And yet Republicans will not allow that to happen.

When Republicans control the Senate, House and White House, and they blame Democrats for the shutdown, I don't think anybody is going to take that seriously.

Republicans have got to fix the DACA crisis Trump precipitated. We are not going to allow 800,000 young Dreamers to be deported.

Mr. President, maybe the reason why more Americans emigrated to Norway last year than the other way around is because they have universal health care and a strong social democracy. https://t.co/2VFRdrw46y
*****************************
We must pass disaster relief right now which treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands just as we will treat Texas and Florida. We cannot continue to delay given the enormous suffering there. https://t.co/VNmcMczw9U
*****************************
We must stand with Dreamers to stop Donald Trump from throwing them out of the only country they have ever known. https://t.co/u6ozGQb5tl
*****************************
Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. They have to pass an annual budget, not more one-month continuing resolutions. We need a bipartisan solution to the economic crises facing the middle class, to the DACA crisis that Trump created and to disaster relief.
*****************************
Trump wants a shutdown. These are the major issues that have to be dealt with to stop him from getting his way.

We can and must protect our country from the serious potential of another terrorist attack without living in an Orwellian world where the government and private corporations can make warrantless searches of Americans' calls, emails and texts.
*****************************
I will vote no on reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill as written gives the government far too much power to spy on innocent U.S. citizens.

*****************************
As Congress moves forward this week on the budget, we must stand with Dreamers. Taking away the legal status of 800,000 young people who were raised in this country and subjecting them to the possibility of deportation would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history.

Republicans in Congress must now summon the courage to stand up to the racist ramblings of our "stable genius" president.

It’s not enough to just respond with anger. We have to build a political movement in this country which says that that is not who we are and we will not tolerate that type of moral inadequacy.
*****************************
All over this country are decent people who tell their kids, don’t judge people based on the color of their skin or the country they came from. Judge them on whether or not they are good human beings.

This is one of the great moral issues of our time. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the DREAM Act now.

Kate and her family would not have been able to grow their organic farm without the help of the Children's Health Insurance Program. If Congress does not get its act together, 9 million children in working families will lose their health insurance. https://t.co/EtN6NhPIZ0

Maybe Trump and Republican leaders believe a government shutdown would be a welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation. But a shutdown would harm working-class families who would be unable to access vital services.

I don't know why President Trump and Republicans want to shut down the government over a wall no one wants and an unprecedented $100 billion increase in military spending. What the American people want is to protect Dreamers and working families. https://t.co/cZ41tOWbvS
*****************************
Today marks 100 days since Congress let the Children’s Health Insurance Program expire. 

Let me say that again: health care for 9 million children has hung in the balance for 100 days. 

We must do better than this.
*****************************
Because the president revoked DACA, some 800,000 young people are living in extraordinary anxiety about whether or not they're going to lose legal status and be subject to deportation. We have got to deal with that decision.
*****************************
We need to get our priorities right. Not giving tax breaks to billionaires. Not throwing millions of people off of health insurance. We have got to pay attention to the working families of the this country.
*****************************
The Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, they control the House. They will determine whether or not there is a government shutdown. I certainly hope there is not a government shutdown.
*****************************
The American people do not want to spend billions of dollars on a wall which Trump told us would be paid for by Mexico. They want to protect Dreamers and working families. https://t.co/WdiBK2scH1
*****************************
It's not just Democrats and Independents. More Republicans support allowing Dreamers to stay in the country than support building a wall. It couldn't be clearer what Congress needs to do.
*****************************
Instead of Attorney General Sessions intensifying the failed war on drugs, states should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. https://t.co/EpXfq5HxAT
*****************************
I'm not sure why President Trump wants to shut down the government over an $18 billion wall that no one wants, isn't needed and Mexico won't pay for. What the American people want, overwhelmingly, is to provide legal protection and a path toward citizenship for 800,000 Dreamers.

Leader McConnell’s statement is very disturbing and misleading. He conveniently ignores the fact that mandatory spending on domestic programs have been severely cut and that the Defense Department has received tens of billions in OCO funding that isn't capped at all. https://t.co/emrHXqUahS
*****************************
The U.S. Congress has got to do more than increase military spending and give tax breaks to billionaires. We are here to protect working families.
*****************************
When Republicans want to add some $100 billion to military spending over the next two years we will not turn our backs on working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must have parity between defense and non-defense spending.
*****************************
I am very disappointed that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, the House and the Senate, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown. They must not allow that. They have got to compromise.

Far from compassionate, Trump's budget — if enacted — would be one of the cruelest in American history. It must be defeated.
*****************************
The budget could cut as much as $1 billion from Head Start, meaning some 95,000 children will be thrown out of early education &amp; child care.
*****************************
His budget eliminates the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program—leaving 1.1 million kids in the streets or home alone after school
*****************************
His plan puts college more out of reach for her children by slashing Pell Grants and eliminating Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants.
*****************************
If an eviction notice arrives, she won't have a lawyer because this “compassionate” budget would eliminate the Legal Services Corporation.
*****************************
Trump’s 31% cut to the EPA means this woman’s children would likely be breathing dirtier air and drinking contaminated water.
*****************************
“Compassion” from Trump for this single mother means $6.2 billion in cuts to affordable housing, which could force her out of her apartment.
*****************************
Let’s look at what Trump’s “compassion” actually means for that mother, her two children and millions of other working-class Americans.
