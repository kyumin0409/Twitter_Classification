@washingtonpost I was a senator for 36 years. I can assure you that your call matters. Your viewpoint might not always win, but your senators hear you.
*****************************
@washingtonpost Especially if you live in WV, NV, AK or OH now is the time to call your senators. Or, encourage your friends in these states to call.
*****************************
@washingtonpost If you believe health care is a right for all, make sure your senators know that this bill is a big step backward.
*****************************
@washingtonpost All Americans deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can get affordable care. But that’s now under threat.
*****************************
@washingtonpost By denying this right, Republican leadership’s “health” bill is fundamentally flawed. It can’t even be fixed on the floor.

*****************************
Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that.
*****************************
Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel.
*****************************
Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy.
*****************************
The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; corporations.
*****************************
America’s soul is rooted in the promise of opportunity. We must protect, support &amp; welcome refugees to keep that promise. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/4K3exquxgl
