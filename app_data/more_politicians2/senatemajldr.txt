With needless delays- &amp; a record-breaking number of cloture votes on nominations, my Democratic colleagues have made this body drag its feet along the way. But the Senate will press on this week to put to rest more of the people’s business before the close of the 115th Congress.
*****************************
The Senate is focused on wrapping up this year’s remaining priorities: getting more of the president’s team in place, confirming well-qualified nominees to our federal courts, and attending to the pressing legislative business the American people expect us to handle.
*****************************
Some of this Congress' biggest accomplishments have been bipartisan. From landmark opioids legislation to improvements in veterans’ services to historic progress on appropriations. Our remaining work on nominations and legislation will require more of that bipartisan spirit.
*****************************
Even after two historic years full of accomplishments for the American people, there are still important items left for this Congress to check off our list before the end of this year.
*****************************
We’ll continue to make nominations a top priority, as we have this entire Congress. The nominees we’ll consider this week are highly regarded and well equipped for public service. I look forward to confirming each of them without further undue delay.
*****************************
As the 115th Congress comes to a close, my colleagues will have much to be proud of. But we aren’t finished yet. The Senate still has a full slate of important business that we must complete before the end of the year.

Our economic boom is not “Armageddon,” or “crumbs,” or “disaster,” as some have suggested. It is rising wages, more job opportunities, and new investment. The real winners here are the American people. Republicans are just proud our policies are helping them do what they do best.

Unemployment in America has now fallen to 3.7 percent. That’s our lowest unemployment rate since 1969. Let's be clear: Government itself is not creating this prosperity. Republicans know that growth starts with workers and entrepreneurs.

Today, we can send a message to the American people that some core principles remain unfettered by the partisan passions of this moment. Facts matter. Fairness matters.
*****************************
We will either give notice that totally uncorroborated allegations are now, officially, enough to destroy an American’s life - or we will declare that our society cannot, must not, set the bar so low.
*****************************
We will either state that facts and evidence can be brushed aside when politically inconvenient, and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics - or we will stand up and say that serious, thoughtful, fact-based deliberation must still define this body.
*****************************
When we vote later this morning, we will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly-qualified judge to our highest court. Not anymore. Not after all this. The United States Senate will also be making a statement.
*****************************
The Senate will be in session at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Under the regular order, the vote to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court will be at 10:30.
*****************************
I was proud to file cloture on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination yesterday evening. And I will be proud to vote to advance his nomination tomorrow.

We owe it to the American people not to be intimidated by these tactics. We owe it to the American people to underscore that you’re innocent until proven guilty. https://t.co/uGzKkP14jP
*****************************
When the noise fades, what’s left is a distinguished nominee with a unanimously well qualified rating from the American Bar Association (the Democrats’ gold standard). A man whom peers and colleagues praise in the strongest terms. That’s Judge Kavanaugh.
*****************************
The FBI has completed yet another background investigation on Judge Kavanaugh and delivered its results to the Senate. The fact is that these allegations have not been corroborated. Not in the new FBI investigation, not anywhere.
*****************************
I just filed cloture on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. There will be plenty of time for Members to review and be briefed on this supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote.

*****************************
Does anyone really think that the same people who called Judge Kavanaugh “evil” long before they heard one word of testimony will be satisfied? It’s time to put this embarrassing spectacle behind us, and vote on this impressive, stunningly qualified Supreme Court nominee.
*****************************
This body and this nation have spent months watching my friends across the aisle grasp at every imaginable excuse to delay this process and damage this nominee. If they had their way, the goalposts on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination would be in another time zone by now.
*****************************
Democrats Repeatedly Said They Were Comfortable With An FBI Investigation That Would Not Take Long. 
https://t.co/xjnEBB5LWb
*****************************
After the FBI shares what they’ve found, Senators will have the opportunity to vote. We’ll have the opportunity to vote “no” on the politics of personal destruction. We’ll have the opportunity to vote “yes” on this fine nominee.
*****************************
Democrats’ mishandling of Dr. Ford’s letter opened the floodgates for a deluge of uncorroborated, unbelievable mud from others. And the mudslide was cheered on, and capitalized on by the far left that has been so eager to stop this nomination. Just politics? I don't think so.
*****************************
Democrats may be trying to move the goalposts every five minutes, but their goal has not moved an inch. They will not be satisfied unless they bring down Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.
*****************************
The Democratic Leader and the ranking Democrat on the Committee both said recently that an FBI investigation can be completed in less than a week.
Let me make a small prediction -- soon enough the goalposts will be on the move once again.
*****************************
It’s almost as if Dr. Ford didn’t want a Washington D.C.-based media circus -- but others with whom she was in contact, and on whom she was relying, did. https://t.co/MNbhVg2kZp

The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee. We're considering it here on the floor. And we'll be voting this week.
*****************************
The confirmation process for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, one of the most qualified and most impressive Supreme Court nominees in our nation’s history, is moving forward.
*****************************
Brett Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified and most impressive Supreme Court nominees in memory. This is a nomination that deserves to move forward -- and that is precisely what is happening.
*****************************
Earlier today, our colleagues on @senjudiciary concluded their thorough, months-long consideration of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination and voted to advance it to the Senate floor with a favorable recommendation.
*****************************
Today, with the unanimous support of my conference, the Senate will proceed to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.

What lesson can we learn from all this? Write to the Senate Democrats in confidentiality and you’ll wind up a household name. https://t.co/Lh2Jnn4mEZ
*****************************
Democratic colleagues did not treat Dr. Ford or her allegation with the seriousness and discretion she deserved. At the 11th hour, when its introduction was certain to introduce further delay, they got it to the press. So much for Dr. Ford’s request for confidentiality, I guess.
*****************************
My Democrat friends might want to consider this from then-Judiciary Committee Chairman JOE BIDEN (D-DE) In 1991: The ‘FBI Explicitly Does Not, In This Or Any Other Case Reach A Conclusion, Period’ https://t.co/NvAI3RqevL
*****************************
Democrats sat on Dr. Ford’s letter for weeks. They kept it secret. They did nothing. And then they threw Dr. Ford’s wishes for confidentiality overboard and leaked it to the press. Does this sound like people who want to get to the truth?
https://t.co/zCZ8af2irg
*****************************
Senate Democrats ignored Dr. Ford’s request for discretion and confidentiality and cheered on a public smear campaign based on uncorroborated allegations. I’m grateful to @ChuckGrassley for handling this with seriousness and responsibility and scheduling Thursday’s hearing.
*****************************
One side is handling these sensitive matters with dignity, with professionalism… by the book. And we have another side that chose to sit on allegations and keep them secret until they were leaked to the press.
*****************************
This is America. Evidence matters. Facts matter. We have never been - and do not wish to be - a society in which a single, uncorroborated allegation can wield veto power over somebody’s life. Everyone deserves better than this. https://t.co/lPazbl1crl
*****************************
The American people know sexual misconduct is serious. They expect this matter to be treated seriously. That’s what @ChuckGrassley has done and is doing. He has acted transparently in the pursuit of truth, and he has treated this matter with kindness and respect. @senjudiciary
*****************************
Let’s put aside the last-minute smears. Let’s return to the facts. Let’s have a fair hearing on Thursday.
*****************************
It remains beyond reasonable dispute that Judge Kavanaugh’s legal brilliance and excellence on the bench make him one of the very most qualified Supreme Court nominees in memory.
*****************************
Hundreds of men and women who have known Brett Kavanaugh across his life have written or spoken out that he is a man of strong character and tremendous integrity. Numerous witnesses testified that Brett Kavanaugh is a trusted mentor, and a lifelong champion of women.
*****************************
Here are the facts before us: This is an allegation of misconduct which all four supposed witnesses either flatly contradict or are unable to back up. It’s not just one alleged witness disagreeing with the allegations -- it’s literally every person who was supposedly there.
*****************************
Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man’s personal and professional life on the basis of unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations. This is a smear campaign, pure and simple…aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate.
*****************************
To some, the ends justify the means. Yet again, Senate Democrats actively withheld information from the rest of the Judiciary committee. 
https://t.co/dtrcsAWEcT

Next week Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath. But we should not have gotten to this point. That this process has played out with so little order and so little sensitivity lies solely at the feet of Senate Democrats.

Last week, the nation watched the president’s outstanding Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, testify before the Judiciary Committee. They saw Chairman @ChuckGrassley guide the committee with gracious, strong leadership and an incredible amount of patience.

During the Obama years, West Virginia’s economy was hit hard. But today, the state’s unemployment rate has been lower during each of the past 19 months under this united Republican government than it was during any month of the Obama administration.

The NDAA authorizes the resources that our men and women in uniform depend on, from Ft. Knox and Ft. Campbell in my home state of Kentucky to installations around the country -- and around the world.
*****************************
Today, @POTUS signed the John S. McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. It gives U.S. servicemembers a raise and authorizes vital programs for our nation’s defense. I’m very proud of this legislation.

Today, Chairman @ChuckGrassley announced the hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. I look forward to the Senate’s consideration of this outstanding nominee.

This good economic news is an inconvenient truth for Senate Democrats, who have opposed our pro-growth policies. But the rest of America isn’t hiding from these numbers. We’re celebrating them.

We learned last week that second quarter real GDP growth exceeded 4%. That’s the best quarterly growth rate in four years and one of the strongest reports since the Great Recession.

What’s really startling is when prominent Democrat leaders let far-left talking points form the basis for their own policy positions. Senate Democrats advocating to #AbolishICE? @JohnCornyn had it right: “Get a grip.”
*****************************
The #AbolishICE movement has said our nation would be better off with no borders and no immigration laws. Period. But the American people know @ICEgov’s mission is essential, and the nation is better for it.

More radical, unhinged rhetoric on a well-qualified #SCOTUS nominee: https://t.co/eU2Cdgaj9U
*****************************
Today, w/ help from a united GOP government, job creators are back doing what they do best. The number of Americans saying now is a good time to find a quality job is at a 17-year high. And the number filing for new unemployment benefits is at a 48-year low. Results &gt; rhetoric.
*****************************
Rhetoric vs. Results: Pres. Obama said “the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America’s businesses.” But his administration set two all-time records for pages in the Federal Register, including many burdensome regulations that tied job creators’ hands.
*****************************
I’m proud of the continued hard work of Chairman @SenShelby, @SenatorLeahy, and subcommittee leaders @lisamurkowski, @SenatorCollins, @SenJohnHoeven, and @SenatorLankford for managing this bipartisan appropriations process.
*****************************
The appropriations measures being considered by the Senate this week cover about 1/8th of federal govt. discretionary spending for the coming year. They include resources for pressing national needs like rebuilding America’s infrastructure and confronting the opioid epidemic.

American manufacturing: Under President Obama vs. Now https://t.co/cdJA8T6bWi
*****************************
Now, less than two years into this united Republican government, the results are different. An all-time high 95.1% of manufacturers have a positive outlook, and two-thirds plan to hire in the coming year.
*****************************
For years, President Obama and Democrats in Congress talked about getting U.S. manufacturing moving. Rhetoric was never in short supply. But results were hard to come by: During the last administration, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs on net.
*****************************
This year, Chairman @SenShelby and @SenatorLeahy have led a bipartisan appropriations process through subcommittee and full committee work. I hope we can continue that same cooperative spirit on the Senate floor to achieve our shared goals for the American people.
*****************************
The Senate remembers USCP Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, killed in the line of duty 20 years ago today. We renew our condolences to their families. We are grateful for them and for all who wear the uniform in harm’s way.
*****************************
In Robert Wilkie, @POTUS has chosen a Secretary of Veterans’ Affairs with whom the Senate can work side-by-side to continue advancing the interests of America’s veterans. I was proud to vote, along with the overwhelming, bipartisan majority of my colleagues, to confirm him today.

Wishing a very happy 95th birthday to my friend, @SenatorDole. Bob has built an extraordinary life, grounded in ordinary American values. Today, and every day, we are grateful for his service.

If “Abolish ICE” socialists had their way, we'd have no borders and no security. My latest op-ed in the @courierjournal: https://t.co/cX4HMUo5Fl
*****************************
Another day, another off-base attack on Judge Kavanaugh. This time, on the "independent counsel" statute. #SCOTUS https://t.co/f4Bz0mqNSN
*****************************
Judge Kavanaugh’s apparent comments would be in line with mainstream views that have been strongly held across the political spectrum – including by Senate Democrats themselves.
*****************************
A bipartisan majority agreed to let the flawed “independent counsels” statute expire in 1999. It has nothing to do with special counsels, or any of the other tools currently in place for holding elected officials accountable.
*****************************
The left’s latest made-up controversy is an attempt to make political hay out of comments Judge Kavanaugh made about the long-ago expired “independent counsels” statute. But here are the facts:
*****************************
This week, even more of our colleagues have come away impressed after meeting with @POTUS’ #SCOTUS nominee, Judge Kavanaugh. But far-left special interests continue grasping at straws and trying to smear this nominee any way they can.
*****************************
This week, the Senate is confirming impressive nominees whom @POTUS has asked to serve our country. Two Asst. Secretaries for the Department of Education. A member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Nominees for the Fifth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals.
*****************************
I’m glad that this step by @IRSnews will make the right of Americans to freely advocate for their strongly-held beliefs less vulnerable to the malice of some in government, and to the proven failures of bureaucracies.
*****************************
In this country, good government means protecting citizens’ First Amendment rights to participate in the competition of ideas – not trying to shut down that competition.
*****************************
Last night, @IRSnews announced that it’s cutting back on the amount of nonpublic information the government collects and stockpiles about Americans who donate to nonprofit causes. It’s particularly welcome news for those of us dedicated to defending the First Amendment.
*****************************
The sky never falls. But the hyperbole and hysteria on #SCOTUS nominees do not end. My weekend op-ed in the Cincinnati @Enquirer: https://t.co/P29luIFgvy
*****************************
In a “breaking news” bombshell report last night, we learned that Judge Kavanaugh enjoys America’s pastime. 🇺🇸⚾️ https://t.co/Yp9LIojey4
*****************************
But now that Democrats know his name, their attacks haven’t gotten any less hysterical. One flavor of the week: misrepresenting his decades-old writings. Perfect conspiracy theory catnip for their far-left base. The only problem? It wasn’t true. #SCOTUS
*****************************
Even before he was nominated for #SCOTUS, Judge Kavanaugh was subjected to “fill in the blank” opposition. @POTUS hadn’t even named his selection, and already, our entire system of government was on its last legs? Give me a break.
*****************************
Judge Kavanaugh seems to impress everyone with whom he crosses paths -- at least those who haven’t blindly announced, in a fit of partisanship, their opposition to this nomination before he was even named. #SCOTUS
*****************************
Judge Kavanagh: Brilliance. Talent. Temperament. An outstanding legal mind. #SCOTUS https://t.co/LbWFe5YduD
*****************************
Judge Kavanaugh is the real deal. An extensive judicial record defined by fairness, thoughtfulness, and thoroughness. @POTUS has made an outstanding choice.
*****************************
This morning, I welcomed Judge Brett Kavanaugh, @POTUS Trump’s outstanding #SCOTUS nominee, to the Senate. I look forward to hearing his testimony, and to voting on his nomination on the floor. https://t.co/KzXdpGvf70
*****************************
Judge Kavanaugh compiled an extensive record on the federal bench, publishing more than 300 opinions, and earning considerable praise for his clear writing and reasoning. It gives us a clear picture of how he would conduct himself on the #SCOTUS.
*****************************
Judges need to be unbiased. They need to treat all parties fairly. They need to approach every case with open ears and an open mind. By all accounts, Judge Kavanaugh is precisely that sort of judge. #SCOTUS
*****************************
Judge Kavanaugh has won the respect of his peers in the legal community and demonstrates a firm understanding of the role of a judge in our republic. I look fwd to meeting w/ him and to the Senate’s thorough consideration of his nomination. My statement: https://t.co/rv1QDCdNyZ

Believe it or not, the sky did not fall. --&gt; https://t.co/4ngra17tzT

Americans see beyond the far-left fear mongering. Senators should do the same. We should evaluate @POTUS’s nominee fairly, based on their qualifications. And we should treat this process with the respect and the dignity that it deserves. #SCOTUSNomination
*****************************
Justice Kennedy’s resignation letter had barely arrived in the President’s hands before several of our Democratic colleagues began declaring their blanket opposition to anyone at all that the President might name. #SCOTUSnominee https://t.co/uQ2QZMOsDD
*****************************
Our Democratic colleagues cry wolf whenever a Republican president nominates anyone to the Supreme Court. No matter their qualifications. No matter their record.  No matter their reputation. It’s the same hyperbole.  The same accusations. The same old story. #SCOTUSnominee
*****************************
On the Fourth of July, our Founding Fathers began a great national experiment. Today, and every day, we celebrate it. https://t.co/3QMSP7yAC0

*****************************
American farm communities need stability and predictability, and they need it urgently. The time has come to deliver. The farm bill is too important a subject to keep our farmers and their families waiting.
*****************************
All week, I’ve highlighted some of the ways the farm bill will support the family farmers whose harvest feeds America and supplies the world. It’s an understatement to say this bill comes at an opportune time.
*****************************
I’m confident Chairman Grassley will capably lead the Judiciary Committee through the confirmation process that lies before us.
*****************************
As I stated yesterday, the Senate stands ready to fulfill our constitutional role by offering advice and consent on @POTUS' nominee to fill the #SCOTUS vacancy that Justice Kennedy’s retirement will create.
*****************************
If you pick up a local paper in almost any state from Montana to Florida, you’ll find that Americans are paying less to keep the lights on. Tax reform is helping millions of families with the monthly bills.
*****************************
Despite warnings from our Democratic colleagues that tax reform savings would never reach consumers, utilities across America are already making that happen.
*****************************
Let’s address farmers’ immediate needs. Let’s give them new tools to help secure their future. The farm bill before us is a prime example of the good that can come when we work together. I look forward to the Senate passing it for America’s farm families.
*****************************
Today, it was my privilege to welcome an Honor Flight of Kentucky veterans to Washington. On behalf of the Commonwealth and all Americans, I was proud to thank them for their sacrifice. https://t.co/Iuun9UeadV

*****************************
The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s nominee to fill this vacancy. We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall.
*****************************
I want to express gratitude for the extraordinary service that Justice Kennedy has offered our nation. We owe him a debt of thanks for his ardent defense of the First Amendment right to political speech. #SCOTUS
*****************************
The success of tax reform might come as a surprise to the Democrats who opposed it at every turn. But it certainly doesn’t surprise those of us who listened to the American people, and delivered.
*****************************
We’ve seen that tax reform is well-suited to the needs of young Americans on the first rungs of the economic ladder, whose employers can now offer more help with continuing education.
*****************************
In six short months, we’ve seen that tax reform is well-suited to the needs of the millions of American workers who’ve already pocketed thousand-dollar bonuses to put toward grocery bills and summer camp costs.
*****************************
In December, the Democratic Leader said on the Senate floor that there’s nothing about tax reform that’s “suited to the needs of the American worker.” Republicans knew better.
*****************************
From top to bottom, this farm bill takes serious steps to ensure the future of American agriculture -- for the sake of our farmers, our rural communities, and the entire country.
*****************************
Farm families across America face uncertainty: Natural disasters, from droughts to floods, volatile world markets, and falling commodity prices.
*****************************
As the proud senior senator from Kentucky, I know how important the farm bill is to agricultural communities in my home state and around the nation.
*****************************
Today, First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner of Kentucky is being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He embodied our nation’s highest values, but never called himself a hero. So today, a grateful nation is doing just that. https://t.co/nx0HDSFarN
*****************************
My Democratic colleagues are arguing with the facts. They’re arguing with the data. They’re arguing with American families who are keeping more of their own money. They’re arguing with the prosperity our agenda is already helping unleash.
*****************************
Democrats may want to put Washington’s foot back on the brake by repealing tax reform and piling up more regulations. But they aren’t just arguing with those of us across the aisle.
*****************************
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my friend Charles Krauthammer this afternoon. https://t.co/ixVOBSYBF9
*****************************
And thanks to the leadership of our colleagues at the subcommittee level, more bills will be on their way to the floor for prompt consideration.
*****************************
This week, we’ve been considering a regular-order appropriations package and voting on amendments. Thanks to Chairman @SenShelby and Ranking Member @SenatorLeahy for the transparent, bipartisan process that produced this bill.
*****************************
Six months later, here’s a remarkable fact: There are now more job openings all across this country than there are Americans looking for work. The optimism and prosperity unleashed by tax reform are part of the reason why.
*****************************
Republicans wanted working families to keep more of what they earn and send less to the IRS. Meanwhile, the Democratic Leader in the House said it was “the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.”
*****************************
Yesterday marked six months since Congress passed our overhaul of America’s tax code. I remember debating the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act back in December. There were two different philosophies on display.
*****************************
My statement on @POTUS’ immigration executive order &gt;&gt; https://t.co/biDd3gTpbM
*****************************
Today marks six months since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed Congress. Already, it’s led employers to issue ‘tax reform bonuses,’ raises, and new benefits to four million workers and counting. That’s welcome relief for middle-class families. https://t.co/O4M7MnVX7B
*****************************
Today, I met with Kathy Kraninger, @POTUS’ nominee to direct the @CFPB. Her resume and reputation suggest she’s well-suited to steer the course @MickMulvaneyOMB has charted toward transparency, accountability, and effectiveness within proper limits. https://t.co/N4KcO1amZF
*****************************
I support, and all of the members of the Republican Conference support, a plan that keeps families together while their immigration status is determined.
*****************************
Led by Chairman @SenShelby, Ranking Member @SenatorLeahy, and all the subcommittee leadership, the Appropriations committee has engaged in precisely the kind of thorough, considered committee work that ought to define this process.
*****************************
The spending agreement reached earlier this year achieved a great deal, but the process wasn’t anybody’s best-case scenario. So here in the Senate, we made it a top bipartisan priority to bring some regular order back into the appropriations process.
*****************************
One year ago, the nation watched and prayed as violence struck a congressional baseball practice. Later today, that near tragedy will become triumph as @SteveScalise joins his teammates &amp; colleagues on the field for the 57th #CongressionalBaseballGame &gt;&gt; https://t.co/ncw1qCb4Vk https://t.co/8rowOdGLTq
*****************************
Fortunately, the facts are the facts. Americans know success when they see it. And Republicans will keep fighting to unleash more prosperity for the middle class.
*****************************
There are more job openings than Americans looking for work for the first time in at least 20 years. But Democrats scoff at falling unemployment. Do they really think an outstanding job market doesn’t matter to American families?
*****************************
In #Kentucky, agriculture is part of who we are. Our farm families produce everything from poultry to soybeans. The farm bill that the Agriculture Committee passed yesterday will assist them, encourage economic growth, and increase investment in rural communities.
*****************************
Today, on the 243rd birthday of the @USArmy, I’m glad we're voting to continue advancing this critical legislation on behalf of America’s brave men and women in uniform.
*****************************
The Armed Services Committee considered and included 300 amendments in the defense bill. On the floor, Chmn @JimInhofe and @SenJackReed included more than 40 more.
*****************************
For months, Secretary Mattis and our military leaders have detailed our servicemembers’ most pressing needs and explained the importance of steady resources in the face of evolving threats. We heard them loud and clear – it’s time to put the defense bill across the finish line.
*****************************
On one side of the aisle are those who mock the good economic news -- those who can’t grasp why an 18-year low in unemployment would matter to American families. On the other side are those of us who helped make it happen.
*****************************
Unemployment is lower today than at any time since 2000. Last week, the House Democratic leader responded: “Hip-hip hooray. Unemployment is down. What does that mean to me?”
*****************************
I’d like to thank the Chairman &amp; @SenStabenow for working w/ me to include my #HempFarmingAct in the bill. It builds on the success of the pilot program I championed in the 2014 farm bill by removing federal roadblocks to industrial hemp.
*****************************
This morning, I’m joining my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee to mark up the farm bill. It’s an impressive piece of legislation, built on bipartisan collaboration and guided by Chairman @SenPatRoberts’ leadership.
*****************************
I want to share the Senate’s warmest wishes for a speedy recovery with Larry Kudlow. Larry's a happy warrior for pro-growth, pro-opportunity economics and one of the best guys in Washington. We hope he gets well soon.
*****************************
Just hours ago, the American delegation concluded their summit meeting with North Korean officials. I congratulate @POTUS on this major step and share his hope that it will begin a process that leads to an historic peace.
*****************************
I just got off the phone with my friend @SenatorDole. I was grateful to catch up and thank him for his many years of honorable public service.
*****************************
It’s one of our most important jobs here in Congress. The 2019 defense authorization is the top item on our to-do list. And we’ll tackle it this week.
*****************************
Congress has passed defense authorization acts for 57 consecutive years. In doing so, we’ve taken steps to fulfill one of our most fundamental constitutional responsibilities: authorizing the funds that our men and women in uniform require to keep us safe.
*****************************
This is part of what we were elected to do: Get Washington D.C.’s foot off the brake. Let hard-working Americans and small businesses spend less time and energy hurdling obstacles put up by the federal government.
*****************************
In 2016, under President Obama, the Federal Register printed nearly 39,000 pages of rules (an all-time high) and another 21,000 pages of proposed rules. 60,000 pages to pile on American workers and job creators. In 2017, we slashed those numbers by more than 50 percent.

- More open positions than workers seeking jobs for 1st time on record.

- More Americans say now is a good time to find a job than at any time in past 17 yrs.
*****************************
Sixteen months ago, @POTUS Trump &amp; GOP majorities arrived in Washington w/ simple instructions from the American people: get the federal government out of our way. Today, under this Republican government, the U.S. economy is healthier than it’s been in a long time.
*****************************
Today, our economy is starting to work better for all kinds of communities. Just look at Ohio &gt;&gt; https://t.co/tTaW3doQkK

The defense bill will support military posts that form the backbone of local communities and advance our National Defense Strategy. Kentuckians are proud of those serving at our state's Army and National Guard installations. When I vote for this defense bill, I'll do it for them.

Tune in tonight for my interview on @FoxNews with @IngrahamAngle at 10 PM ET https://t.co/lQrBKrdT80
*****************************
This isn’t due diligence. It isn’t good government. It’s what happens when our colleagues across the aisle put political slogans about “the resistance” ahead of the country’s needs.
*****************************
Not a single Senator voted against confirming Robert Wier or Fernando Rodriguez to serve as district judges yesterday. But Democrats forced us to invoke cloture on each of them, and then made sure they soaked up #Senate floor time, even though literally no Senator opposed them.
*****************************
Cloture votes used to be a rare tool of last resort, only used in a tiny handful of cases. Not these days. In many cases, the nominees in question are completely uncontroversial.
*****************************
This morning, I was honored to meet a number of #Kentucky veterans at the World War II Memorial and welcome them to Washington. My father fought in World War II. So I was particularly grateful to hear these veterans’ stories and share in their special moment of remembrance. https://t.co/1samMlF4B4

As the #Senate works to give America’s armed forces the resources they need to keep us safe, I’m proud that @POTUS has signed into law our effort to give our veterans the quality care they deserve. #VAMISSIONAct
*****************************
The John S. McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act is the result of months of serious, bipartisan work by the Armed Services Committee. And it’s a major step toward delivering the resources our military needs to tackle today's challenges.

On June 6th, 1944, the free world embarked on a daring mission of historic proportions. With conviction and bravery, the Greatest Generation ran into the breach. They stared down the most pernicious evil the modern world had ever seen -- and prevailed. https://t.co/5AfrTECJ8z

*****************************
The bipartisan work of the Armed Services Committee has produced a strong NDAA. This legislation sends a clear message that we have our warfighters’ backs.
*****************************
After years of spending caps harming the readiness of our military, Congress passed a two-year agreement that included the largest year-on-year increase in funding for our military in 15 years. It’s time to take the next step with the critical National Defense Authorization Act.

*****************************
One bill after another, one confirmation after another, the Senate is producing accomplishments that will directly improve the lives of the American people.
*****************************
The #Senate is having a productive week: 
-Passed VA MISSION Act to keep our promise to our vets
-Confirming more of @POTUS’s nominees
-Updated how Senate handles claims of harassment
-Committees working on annual defense &amp; appropriations bills
*****************************
This morning, @POTUS signed a law that will help middle-class families/small businesses access credit. It was the product of hard work by Chairman @MikeCrapo and the Banking Committee, and I was proud to support it.
*****************************
Today, the #Senate passed the VA MISSION Act to help vets access the care they need, when and where they need it. It has the support of @POTUS, veterans advocates, and bipartisan majorities in Congress. Now, it’s almost reality for our heroes. (2/2) https://t.co/cJRaW2jO23
*****************************
Veterans of all eras rely on the promise of accessible, quality care when they return home. But too often, the VA has fallen short of fulfilling it, with long waiting lists and limited treatment options. The shortcomings of the federal bureaucracy were apparent. (1/2)
*****************************
Local lenders and the communities that depend on them needed relief from the inefficient, imprecise, one-size-fits-all regulatory approach of Dodd-Frank. Thanks to Chairman @MikeCrapo and the Banking Committee, that’s just what Congress and @POTUS are poised to deliver.
*****************************
Workplace harassment is unacceptable anywhere – end of story. With @SenAmyKlobuchar and @RoyBlunt’s proposal, Congress will be better able to hold people accountable, protect staff, and prevent harassment. https://t.co/wuJIhj0nlF
*****************************
Thanks to the bipartisan work of @SenAmyKlobuchar and @RoyBlunt, the Senate is coming together to update the laws governing how we address workplace harassment claims to keep staff and others safe. @SenSchumer and I enthusiastically support their proposal. https://t.co/ovdHN3Ght4

With @POTUS’ signature yesterday, this unified GOP government has put yet another onerous regulation into the wastebasket. https://t.co/RNTbvhah9c
*****************************
The bill before us carries the support of @POTUS Trump and 38 veterans advocacy organizations. It’s based on a simple idea: Promises made to those who sacrifice for our freedoms must be promises kept. I’m grateful to @SenatorIsakson for leading the charge to keep this promise.
*****************************
Delays at the VA cannot stand between veterans and the medical care they need. The shortcomings of a federal bureaucracy do not “free” our nation from its promises to our all-volunteer armed forces. Veterans deserve prompt, thorough care. Period. https://t.co/rBXyrcUe89
*****************************
Today, @POTUS signed the 16th Congressional Review Act resolution passed by this GOP Congress. It repealed a rule that made life needlessly complicated for the American auto industry and its customers. Congress had its say, and accountability won out in the end. https://t.co/hdBYdT0X5v
*****************************
Today, the brave men and women of the @CIA welcomed their colleague, Gina Haspel, to a new role for which she is uniquely well-qualified. I am proud the Senate confirmed the right woman for the right moment. Congratulations, Director Haspel.

Robert Wilkie’s record of public service makes him an outstanding choice for Secretary @DeptVetAffairs. He'll be tasked with fulfilling commitments to veterans &amp; their families. This is an incredibly important mission, and he's well-qualified to tackle it. https://t.co/grd6wzfLgj
*****************************
The prayers of the entire Senate are with the victims of today’s violence in Santa Fe, their families, and the community that is coming together to support them. We are especially grateful for the first responders and others who work to protect and save lives.
*****************************
The Senate will pass the VA MISSION Act next week to strengthen the resources available to our veterans @DeptVetAffairs. My statement: https://t.co/zmTc1cK8cc
*****************************
The Senate just confirmed Gina Haspel to lead the @CIA.  Her talent and expertise make her uniquely qualified to face America’s biggest national security challenges.
*****************************
According to new survey data from @shopfloorNAM, more than 93% of U.S. manufacturing firms have a positive outlook. Already, 77% of manufacturers are reporting hiring new workers, and 86% say they’re investing in plants and equipment. That's a unified GOP gov't in action. (2/2)
*****************************
Republican policies are shaking the regulatory rust off of the U.S. economy, and American job creators, entrepreneurs, and working families are thinking big again. As we put a stop to the last admin’s top-down federal rulemaking, U.S. manufacturing is churning back to life. (1/2)
*****************************
Gina Haspel is the right woman at the right time. Senators on both sides of the aisle agree. It’s time to rise to the occasion and swiftly confirm our next @CIA director. https://t.co/0koT2MvvYB
*****************************
Last year, under the leadership of @AjitPaiFCC, the agency sought to fix this mistake and restore the rules that helped the internet flourish, while still protecting consumers from abuses. The resolution Democrats put forward today would undo that progress. (2/2)
*****************************
In 2015, President Obama’s FCC set out to fix what wasn’t broken. It imposed regulations designed for Depression-era telephones on new technologies that fit in our pockets. So much for the light-touch approach that helped the early internet grow. (1/2)
*****************************
Even in @SenSchumer’s backyard of Brooklyn, lower excise taxes are letting @nydistilling cut prices. In Kentucky, @CopperAndKings says tax reform is one of the most important initiatives for helping small businesses create jobs. (2/2)
*****************************
After 8 years of Democrats’ policies enriching big cities but leaving small businesses behind, Republican policies are helping workers and job creators thrive all over the country. From Kentucky to Oregon, America’s growing craft distilling industry is a perfect example. (1/2)
*****************************
Gina Haspel is the right woman at the right time. There is no reason why her confirmation should be delayed, and I look forward to advancing it expeditiously.
*****************************
.@SenateGOP and @POTUS Trump had a productive meeting today in the
@uscapitol.  Our shared agenda is critical to moving America forward. https://t.co/EQc5mg3mPy
*****************************
The amount employers spent on worker pay and benefits grew more in 2017 than in any calendar year under President Obama. This is just the start of what can happen when Republicans get Washington out of the way.
*****************************
For years, Democratic policies like high taxes and runaway regulations put a headwind in the faces of American job creators. Now, historic tax reform, regulatory relief, and the rest of our opportunity agenda mean the wind is once again at their backs.
*****************************

*****************************
This weekend, I had the pleasure of traveling to the beautiful hills outside Sedona, Arizona and spending time with John and Cindy McCain on their back porch. I shared my gratitude -- all of our gratitude -- for his service and his sacrifice. (1/2)

After years of failed Democratic policies, America is open for business once again.
Surveys show that since @POTUS and Republicans in Congress were elected, three times as many small/indep. employers feel confident in expanding their businesses.

In 2013, Senate Democrats voted to confirm John Brennan as CIA Director. What’s changed? https://t.co/JXSMJ3v9Bd

*****************************
Overnight, @SecPompeo completed a sensitive diplomatic mission and
returned home from North Korea with three freed American prisoners. The
families of these three men, and the entire country, are grateful. @StateDept
*****************************
Tight economic sanctions brought the Iranian regime to the table last time, but unfortunately, it led to a hopelessly flawed agreement. @POTUS Trump did the right thing on the Iran agreement.  I think he’ll make a better deal.

*****************************
The #Senate is processing six more well-qualified nominees for the federal bench. Each nominee on the slate has been vetted by the Judiciary Committee. And each stands ready to serve as a diligent caretaker of the rule of law. We will keep taking care of the people’s business.
*****************************
Gina Haspel is a tremendous choice to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. She would bring more direct, hard-earned experience to the role of @CIA director than any leader in the agency’s history.
*****************************
When Democrats controlled Washington, more than 75 percent of manufacturers said an unfavorable business climate from taxes and regulations was a top concern. Now, fewer than 19 percent say that. Republican policies are working.
*****************************
In December 2017, after just one year of Republican policies, optimism among American manufacturers hit the highest level ever recorded.
*****************************
The percentage of American workers who are unemployed, underemployed, or discouraged recently hit a 17-year low. And the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits has fallen to a 45-year low.
*****************************
The JCPOA was a flawed agreement which @POTUS determined is not in America's nat'l security interests. I share his commitment that Iran must never acquire/develop a nuclear weapon. My statement --&gt; https://t.co/qtRdxzgygC
*****************************
Republican policies have taken Washington’s foot off the brake of the U.S. economy. We’ve rolled back a host of job-killing regulations, passed historic tax reform, and helped to unleash a dynamic, job-creating economy.
*****************************
This week, the #Senate will consider another slate of extremely well-qualified nominees for seats on the federal bench. A thoughtful, independent, and expert judiciary is a cornerstone of our constitutional order, and I'll be proud to support the first of 6 nominees later today.

Dodd-Frank’s inefficient, one-size-fits-all framework dropped small banks &amp; credit unions into the regulatory maze that was intended for Wall Street. For 8 yrs, they’ve faced a staggering compliance burden that now consumes, on average, 24% of their net income. #Relief4MainStreet

The Senate’s loss is @SenThadCochran’s family’s gain. As we say our farewells over the next few weeks, I know all of our colleagues will join me in wishing him health and every happiness as he sets out on his next chapter.

Fortunately, in the last year, a new administration and a united front in Congress have charted a new course. America is rebuilding our capabilities, our partnerships, and our will to do what the circumstances require. #AIPAC2018

All these failures stemmed from a central misunderstanding: For eight years, the previous administration failed to recognize that the U.S. and Israel are stronger together, and that we share a commonality of interests. #AIPAC2018
*****************************
The Obama administration’s fealty to the nuclear deal spawned a reluctance to address Iran’s regional ambitions. And Iran was happy to exploit that void, menacing our ships and planes deployed to the Persian Gulf. #AIPAC2018

To Lie in Honor is a very rare tribute, even rarer for an American w/o Gov or military service. But it perfectly suits Billy Graham, whose preaching inspired hundreds of millions worldwide, who counseled presidents, and whom an entire nation came to know as “America’s pastor.”
*****************************
Today, #BillyGraham will Lie in Honor in the Rotunda of the US Capitol. He will be the 4th person to which this honor has been bestowed, and one that "America's Pastor" has certainly earned.

If a solution is developed in the future that can pass both the House &amp; #Senate and that @POTUS would sign into law, we should turn to it. But for that to happen, Dems will need to take a second look at the necessary core elements of #immigration reform. https://t.co/6duBnTCbZT
*****************************
Democrats like to speak about the importance of paid leave. But not a single one of them voted in favor of #TaxReform.

Every single Democrat in the House and #Senate voted against the bill that included @SenatorFischer’s paid family leave incentives.
*****************************
Thanks to the tireless work of @SenatorFischer, the #TaxCutsandJobsAct encourages more employers to provide paid family leave. That's good news for nearly 4 Million American families that will welcome a child this year.

#TaxReform is working for the American people.
*****************************
Several senators, led by Senator @ChuckGrassley, have crafted legislation that accommodates the major interests of all sides. It fulfills the stated goal of Democrats AND conforms to the @POTUS' requirements for #Immigration &amp; #DACA.
*****************************
Because of #TaxReform, when a couple starts a family, they’ll benefit from the fact that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct doubled the child tax credit, thanks to the work of @SenDeanHeller throughout the committee process.
*****************************
#Senate Democrats say they want resolution for illegal immigrants who were brought to this country as children. @POTUS' framework would do just that and more by offering a more than generous resolution to 1.8 million such individuals.
*****************************
Remember: #Senate Democrats wanted this #Immigration debate. They shut down the federal government for 300 million Americans, unnecessarily, to guarantee we could have this debate this week. https://t.co/xDqsg44zhI
*****************************
This entire week has been set aside, as I assured it would be, for votes on #DACA, border security, and other #immigration issues. We should be wrapping up a week of debate, amendments, &amp; numerous votes. Instead, we have yet to vote on a single amendment.
*****************************
In addition to @POTUS calling for the nation's flags to be flown at half-staff, the #Senate will hold a moment of silence at Noon to honor the victims in Parkland, Florida.
*****************************
Schools should be places where children can learn, and faculty and staff can work, without fear of violence. My colleagues from Florida will carry home the prayers of the whole Senate, for victims and their families, for the community of Parkland, and for the first responders.
*****************************
I'm deeply saddened by the horrific violence in Florida. Praying for the victims, their families, and the Parkland community. Always grateful for first responders who charge into harm’s way.
*****************************
We must streamline regulations, reform the permitting process, and get government out of the way wherever possible. I’m grateful @POTUS is prioritizing this and reaching across the aisle to fix our failing #Infrastructure.
*****************************
Keeping Americans safe does not need to be a partisan issue &amp; addressing important safety issues along w #DACA, border security, and other parts of our broken immigration system is our best chance to produce legislation that can pass the House, #Senate, and earn @POTUS' signature
*****************************
#TaxReform is working for Americans https://t.co/4K7Huw9RIn
*****************************
.@POTUS' #DACA framework is a compassionate resolution for the illegal immigrants who were brought to this country as children. It offers a generous solution for those 1.8 million that goes well beyond what many anticipated he would offer.

*****************************
Day after day, the headlines show more bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits as a direct result of #TaxReform. National employers like @pfizer &amp; @HomeDepot, which employ more than half a million Americans, have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in employee bonuses.
*****************************
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct will directly help families by cutting tax rates. In every paycheck, American workers will keep more of what they earn.

#TaxReform is working for the American people.
*****************************
More than 3.5 Million American workers have already benefited thanks to #TaxReform and the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. https://t.co/xLyOGPKz2O
*****************************
If other #immigration proposals are to be considered, Senators will have to introduce their own amendments, rather than just talk about them. I made a commitment to hold this debate this week. I've lived up to my commitment. I hope this opportunity does not go to waste.
*****************************
Yesterday, several of my colleagues announced an #immigration compromise that I believe is our best chance to make law. It gives a compassionate solution for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought to the US as children. And it delivers on @POTUS' stated conditions.
*****************************
Every Senator has had ample time to prepare for this week's #immigration debate on the #Senate floor. The clock is ticking, but debate has yet to begin because Democrats have yet to yield back any of their post-cloture time. https://t.co/AHSMdpvFAp
*****************************
This week, I urge all Senators to look past making political points on #immigration and #DACA, and focus on making actual law.
*****************************
Millions of Americans are receiving some form of a special #TaxReform bonus thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct.

This is not what "#Armageddon" looks like. https://t.co/xLyOGPKz2O
*****************************
For a month now, I’ve repeatedly said I’d bring #immigration to the #Senate floor following a government funding agreement. Senators have had plenty of time to prepare. There is no reason why we should not reach a bipartisan solution this week.

*****************************
I hope the #Senate can seize this opportunity and deliver real progress towards securing our border, reforming aspects of our immigration policy, and achieving a resolution for individuals who were brought to our country illegally when they were young.
*****************************
The Secure and Succeed Act is our best chance of producing a solution that can actually resolve the immigration issue. We need a bill that can pass the #Senate and pass the House and earn @POTUS' signature.

*****************************

*****************************
This bill represents a significant, bipartisan step forward. I urge every Senator to review this legislation and join in voting to advance it.
*****************************
Too often, underfunded, over-complicated bureaucracies fail to deliver the care our #Veterans deserve. This bill will provide for our returning heroes.
*****************************
As I’ve said publicly many times, our upcoming immigration debate on #DACA, border security, &amp; other issues will be a process that is fair to all sides. While I obviously cannot guarantee any outcomes, let alone supermajority support, I can ensure the process is fair to all sides
*****************************
The bipartisan budget agreement will fund new grants, prevention programs, and law enforcement efforts in vulnerable communities across the country struggling against the #opioidcrisis and substance abuse.
*****************************
In addition to helping our military and #Veterans, this bipartisan agreement will provides funding for disaster relief efforts. Last year, powerful storms crippled #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI and damaged communities from #Florida to #Texas, this bill will get more help on the way.
*****************************
First and foremost, this bipartisan agreement will unwind the sequestration cuts that have hurt our military and jeopardized national security. As @DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis said, “no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.”
*****************************
For the first time in years, our military will have the resources needed to keep us safe. This funding will help serve #Veterans who have bravely served, &amp; it will ensure efforts such as disaster relief, infrastructure, and build on our fight against opioid abuse &amp; drug addiction
*****************************
I'm happy to announce that our bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on defense spending and other priorities have yielded a significant agreement. Thank you @SenSchumer for joining me this afternoon, and for the productive discussions that generated this proposal.

https://t.co/Lkw1OK4E0g

This Congress is determined to reignite an #economy that works for everyone. That’s why #TaxReform lets families across the US keep more of what they earn, and makes America a more attractive place to create #jobs and gives our businesses a fairer fight with foreign competitors.
*****************************
Take-home pay is going up, and families everywhere are keeping more of their own hard-earned money. This is great news for middle class Americans.

*****************************
Already, millions of American workers have received a #TaxReform bonus, pay increase, or other benefits, but apparently a $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 bonus isn’t much to my colleagues from New York or San Francisco.

Even the Democrats’ government shutdown couldn’t keep this GOP Congress from finding new ways to cut taxes. Included in yesterday’s bipartisan bill was an additional $31 billion in tax cuts. Specifically, we delayed 3 onerous Obamacare taxes.

*****************************
We have been talking for months about ways to address Congress’ unfinished business — military spending, disaster relief, healthcare, immigration, and border security.

Now those talks can get going again.
*****************************
During the shutdown, the #Senate made no substantive progress – not an inch – on the serious, bipartisan negotiations that it will take us to resolve issues such as immigration and border security, health care, disaster relief, defense spending, &amp; many other matters.
*****************************
As I’ve said repeatedly over the past week, shutting down the government is an irresponsible way to do business. All of our important business for the American people had to be put on hold while this manufactured crisis was dealt with.
*****************************
It's now evident that this filibuster is doing nothing to generate bipartisan progress on issues that Americans care about. Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA, defense, or any of our other shared priorities.
*****************************
Today at noon, every Senator can vote to end this government shutdown. We will vote to end this filibuster and advance instead a bipartisan bill that would put this whole mess behind us.
*****************************
A quick update on the where things stand in the #Senate. https://t.co/BalWNAdBCn

To most Americans, taking care of our military and #veterans, providing #healthcare for needy children, and funding the @CDCgov sound like fundamental responsibilities. 

To the Democratic Leader, apparently, they sound like hostages ripe for the taking.

#SchumerShutdown
*****************************
In the #Senate, the minority has the power to filibuster. And on Friday, the Democratic Leader made the extraordinary and destructive choice to filibuster the bipartisan bill and guarantee the American people a #SchumerShutdown.

*****************************
Here’s the difference between the Democratic Leader and the rest of the #Senate tonight:
⬇️
He wants to keep the government shut down for hundreds of millions of Americans until we finish negotiating on illegal immigration.
*****************************
Remember ➡️ a bipartisan majority of the #Senate, Republicans and Democrats, voted to avoid this #SchumerShutdown.
*****************************

⬇️
https://t.co/YDNNlc1xmk

*****************************
.@realDonaldTrump, the House, a bipartisan majority of the #Senate, and the American people cannot begin to understand why the Democratic Leader thinks the entire government should be shut down until he gets his way on illegal immigration. #SchumerShutdown
*****************************
The United States of America is officially in Day 1 of a government shutdown, thanks to #Senate Democrats. https://t.co/ePmf7cGaeF
*****************************
The Democratic Leader took the extraordinary step of filibustering a government funding bill, preventing it from passing, and plunging our country into this 100% avoidable mess.
*****************************
The facts before us are simple.

Right now, the Democratic leader has no compromise immigration bill on the table. No bill exists.

Why do Americans need to suffer from a government shutdown when he doesn’t even have an immigration bill?
*****************************
#Senate Democrats now say that illegal immigration should take priority over keeping the government open at all.

Nothing  for opioid treatment centers, #Veterans, or the families of fallen  soldiers. Nothing for the nearly 9,000,000 American children on #CHIP.
*****************************
It is bad enough to threaten a government shutdown. But it is downright senseless to create a hostage situation without even being able to express what your own demands are. https://t.co/VKrgc3bLat

A partial list of what #Senate Democrats will be jeopardizing by shutting down the government over #DACA:
➡ #Veterans’ services
➡ opioid treatment centers
➡ death benefits for the families of fallen soldiers
➡ health insurance for nearly 9,000,000 vulnerable children
*****************************
#Senate Democrats do not oppose a single thing in this bill.

https://t.co/LUk6SUpvoN
*****************************
The vote to fund the government and the 9,000,000 kids depending on #CHIP should be easy, except the Democratic Leader has convinced #Senate Ds to filibuster any funding bill that doesn’t include legislation they are demanding for people who came to the United States illegally.
*****************************

Keeping the government running in addition to a 6 year Children’s Health Insurance Program extension, which gives security to the families of nearly 9 million American children who depend on the program for coverage, is commonsense.

Last week the automaker @FiatChrysler_NA announced that it is renewing production lines in America, where prohibitive business taxes once stood in the way. That's 2,500 new jobs coming to America, thanks to #TaxReform.

✔funding our troops
✔strengthening national security

*****************************
The choice to fund the government by Friday is simple.
1) pass a noncontroversial, bipartisan bill to keep the government open
OR
2) Democrats manufacture a crisis &amp; force a government shutdown over an unrelated issue that we have until at least March to resolve
*****************************
As a direct result of #TaxReform, @Apple will pay special bonuses worth $2,500 to employees and repatriate much of the $250 billion in cash they have been holding overseas. This is not what Armageddon looks like.

Section 702 does not permit the targeting of American citizens anywhere in the world.

Let me repeat: Section 702 does not allow the targeting of American citizens. Nor the targeting of anyone of any nationality who is known to be in the U.S.
*****************************
Section 702, one of the most important tools that our warfighters and intelligence professionals use to wage the war on terror and keep Americans safe, allows the United States to collect communications from foreign terrorists who wish harm on America and our allies.

With no imminent deadline on #immigration, and with bipartisan talks well underway, there is no reason why Congress should hold government funding hostage over the issue of illegal immigration.
*****************************

Thank you @POTUS for all you’re doing on behalf of the American people. 2017 has been a year of extraordinary accomplishments for the Trump White House. https://t.co/BE7RteqEXQ
*****************************
Thank you to all those who helped give middle class Americans #TaxReform they deserve. The members of @GOPSenFinance, @BudgetGOP, @EnergyGOP, @SpeakerRyan &amp; @RepKevinBrady, and of course @POTUS and @VP. We could not have done it without each and every one of you.
*****************************

Not only did the #Senate pass once-in-a-generation #TaxReform last night, we voted to repeal #Obamacare’s individual mandate tax, so that low and middle income families are not forced to purchase something they either don’t want or can’t afford.
*****************************

BREAKING
↓
The #Senate has passed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct to give hard working Americans the #TaxReform they deserve. https://t.co/dndSY7vUfL

Democrats have long called for #TaxReform, but have suddenly changed their mind. Does a new @POTUS mean they are ok with slow growth and an underperforming #economy?

The #TaxCutsandJobsAct:

*****************************
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct not only modernizes our burdensome tax code, it also strengthens our national security by using more of our own #energy in Alaska and repeals the harmful individual mandate that forces Americans to buy #Healthcare plans they can't afford.
*****************************
In addition to CHIP and #Veterans Choice, we must approve supplemental disaster funding for states and territories that are still struggling to rebuild after a year of devastating natural disasters.
*****************************
Congress needs to work together to renew the #Veterans Choice program, which aims to cut wait times for @DeptVetAffairs #healthcare and give our veterans flexibility to access care outside the system.
*****************************
Congress must renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program so the parents of the nine million children who are covered by CHIP can know their children’s health care is secure.
*****************************
Congress is close to passing real #TaxReform for the American people. @POTUS will have it on his desk very soon. https://t.co/1k7mCYJyn7

Before the end of this week, Congress must ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect Americans and face the challenges of a dangerous world.

The #Democrats are indeed embarking on a #filibustersummer
*****************************
Why should all Senators vote for #defense appropriations? Pay raises for our troops ✓ Better medical care ✓ Better mental-health care ✓
*****************************
The depth of loss these families must be feeling is awful. The Senate is thinking of them today &amp; the victims they loved #Charleston (2/2)
*****************************
The news out of #Charleston is tragic. That something like this could occur at a house of worship makes it that much worse. (1/2)
*****************************
Joint statement with @SpeakerBoehner on #TPA, #TAA, and #customs. http://t.co/0bmspAbuaq
*****************************
Dems must think this “Filibuster Summer” idea their leaders hatched isn’t good for America’s #nationalsecurity / job security in their state
*****************************
Dems must know you can’t take credit for promises in a #defense authorization bill if you vote against the approps bill that would fund them
*****************************
Today, @POTUS finally admitted what the rest of the country already knew. #Obamacare http://t.co/8fCcigsCXb
*****************************
This is certainly not a moment to try and use our #military as leverage in order to secure a more cash for bureaucracies like the IRS. #NDAA
*****************************
Dems are ready to deny our troops benefits they’ve earned, even shut down the gov if they can't get more cash for bureaucracies like the IRS
*****************************
Just about all Americans would say: what we need right now isn’t a summer of filibusters but a season of serious, bipartisan solutions #NDAA
*****************************
Obama admin. didn’t have a firm grip on the almost $2.8 Billion paid to insurers from January-April 2014 - http://t.co/f2dDhGAIH1 #Obamacare
*****************************
#NDAA is a bill that aims to transform bureaucratic waste into crucial investments for the men and women who give everything to protect us.
*****************************
#NDAA contains input from both parties &amp; reflects priorities from both sides. That’s why it sailed out of committee 22 to 4.
*****************************
There are more than 1,400 jobs at the Blue Grass Army Depot and hiring will continue when operations at the new facility begin. #Kentucky
*****************************
Blue Grass Army Depot is now close to completing construction of a state-of-the-art chemical demilitarization facility. #Kentucky
*****************************
This year’s #NDAA has been open to a vigorous &amp; bipartisan amend. process, with more than a dozen amendments from both sides being adopted.
*****************************
#NDAA is one of the most important bills considered each year. That’s why the new majority has made it one of our top priorities.
*****************************
Happy 91st to the 41st, @GeorgeHWBush

#Kentucky is proud to be home to @FortKnoxKY and grateful for all they give back to the Commonwealth and the nation. http://t.co/ZTDq18DohA
*****************************
Dems are holding our troops hostage in the most "diverse and complex array of crises since the end of” WWII. #NDAA http://t.co/N5ckjWTLzn
*****************************
The #cybersecurity bill has been carefully scrutinized by both parties, easily passed through cmte, &amp; posted online for months to read.
*****************************
It's awfully cynical for Dem leaders to vote against the very same #cybersecurity bill their own party overwhelmingly endorsed in committee
*****************************
It's #seersucker Thursday in the #Senate. http://t.co/8w6q1MBI3A
*****************************
Democrats have “decided to block all spending bills starting with the defense appropriations" http://t.co/3VYwPBlDzH @washingtonpost
*****************************
The @WhiteHouse owes it to every American to let #Congress help them get up to speed with the #cybersecurity realities of the 21st Century.

*****************************
No one works harder than @SenatorIsakson, the only Senator who is chairing two committees. This diagnosis will not slow him down one bit.
*****************************
If Dems are worried about #IRS funding or adding new paint to their offices, we can have that discussion. But leave our troops out of it.
*****************************
#Kentucky is proud to be the home of @FortCampbell &amp; the @101stAASLTDIV. http://t.co/Q6JfZujl7S
*****************************
You have to give @POTUS credit for trying to salvage a law that only 1 out of every 9 Americans think is actually working. #Obamacare
*****************************
It’s hard to disagree with the top #Vermont health official who said that #Obamacare’s exchanges "just [weren’t] set up for success."
*****************************
We all know that #Obamacare is filled w #brokenpromises, higher costs, and failure. So let’s work together for real health reform instead.
*****************************
Obamacare never had a website problem, it had an #Obamacare problem.

I will be joining @BretBaier on @SpecialReport this evening in the 6:00 PM hour. Make sure to tune into @FoxNews tonight.

Courtesy of #ObamaCare: Broken promises, plagued by failure &amp; cost skyrocket for millions. http://t.co/g5jJ0rOPG9
*****************************
#Democrats think now is the time to hold our national security hostage to partisan demands for more spending on bureaucracies, like the #IRS
*****************************
Believe it or not, but @POTUS said #Obamacare “hasn’t had an adverse effect on people who already had health insurance.” #BrokenPromises.
*****************************
Perhaps @POTUS will make even more bizarre claims today as he tries to bolster the image of a law "only 11%" of Americans say is a success.
*****************************
#Obamacare has been a disaster from the start. According to @CNN "only 11%" of Americans call it a success. http://t.co/oHVtlcmMGg
*****************************
Tune in to the @hughhewitt show tonight @ 6:20 PM Eastern where we will be discussing #NDAA,#PatriotAct, #Obamacare. http://t.co/Es9umapN12
*****************************
Some Kentuckians may now face double-digit premium increases for the second, or even third, year in a row. #Obamacare is a mess.
*****************************
Many small and medium sized businesses, which are the engines of our #economy, are now facing premium hikes of nearly 20% due to #Obamacare.
*****************************
Americans deserve health reform that lowers costs &amp; increases choice, instead of hurting the Middle Class the way #Obamacare does.
*****************************
Our troops are not a “waste of time.” #NDAA http://t.co/5g9u1d0kQY http://t.co/xcMRpeWYHK
*****************************
#Obamacare is a mess. It’s a law filled with #brokenpromises, plagued by failure, and has caused costs to skyrocket for millions.
*****************************
Blocking #NDAA funding is not in our national interest and it's profoundly unfair to our nation's brave troops.
*****************************
Despite the fact that the funding level authorized in #NDAA is exactly the same as @POTUS requested in his budget, he is threatening to veto
*****************************
#NDAA is even more critical now with the rise of #ISIL, #Iran's quest for nuclear weapons, and China &amp; Russia widening their influence.
*****************************
.@SenatorRounds just delivered his first speech on the #Senate floor this afternoon. A great speech on a critical topic.

It now falls on all of us to work diligently and responsibly to get the American people the best outcome that can be reasonably expected.
*****************************
There needs to be a basic assurance that the system envisioned in the House-passed FISA bill will function as its proponents say it will.
*****************************
The fixes embodied in amendments filed to the House-passed FISA bill last night are common sense.
