From excusing Jamal Khashoggi’s murder to aiding this disastrous war in Yemen, the Trump administration is essentially playing the part of Saudi Arabia’s defense lawyer.

*****************************
For too long, the US has been involved in a Yemeni civil war that’s killed thousands and forced millions to the brink of famine. And as Trump kowtows to the Saudis, it’s up to Congress to demonstrate America’s moral leadership. We need to end US support for this war now.

These sanctions are insufficient. After repeated Saudi lies about what happened to Khashoggi, the Trump administration appears to just be following the Saudi playbook: blame mid-level folks, exonerate those at the top.

When Mitch McConnell says "completely start over" here, what he means is take us back to when you could be discriminated against if you have a pre-existing condition. And that tens of millions would lose their insurance.

Jamal Khashoggi is a Virginia resident, so his disappearance is personal to me. President Trump needs to raise this case immediately with Saudi Arabia and Turkey and demand answers. We should be extending support from our federal agencies for a real investigation.

Why not do a real investigation? Why limit Senate access to the report? Why limit public access to it?

There can only be one of two answers: the Republican majority doesn’t care about allegations of sexual assault, or they’re worried of what a true investigation would uncover.
*****************************
Senators can’t even discuss the report’s contents with the public. And they’re not releasing it to the public. This is an insult to Americans concerned about the future of the Supreme Court.
*****************************
The “report” is available for Senators to review in a secure office but get this—there’s only ONE copy! That means Senators have to sign up for hourlong slots between now and the expected vote. There may not even be time for all 100 of us to read it before our first vote!
*****************************
This process was wrapped up in just *5 days,* despite the many witnesses pleading to share relevant information who were ignored by the FBI.

*****************************
I agree. https://t.co/B8FYRjUsJr
*****************************
What Republicans shouldn't rush: a Supreme Court confirmation when serious charges of sexual assault are on the table.

What Republicans *should* rush: a vote on legislation to protect the Mueller investigation - given that, by week's end, the man overseeing it could be fired.
*****************************
There are endless reasons a survivor of sexual assault wouldn’t file a report right away, not least of which is the fear of retribution, doubt, and character attacks—a fear which Trump and many members of the GOP are instilling anew in millions of women and girls.

After ransoming a Supreme Court seat for 9 months prior to 2016's election, the GOP wants to force a rushed vote on this nomination—revealing a desire to hide aspects of Kavanaugh's record. This appointment is for life. The stakes are so high. This nomination should be stopped.
*****************************
Kavanaugh failed to show respect for Supreme Court precedent. Documents from his past reveal he thinks Roe can be overturned. By stating the Court can always overrule “settled law,” we’re left to wonder what all he'd “unsettle” - from the ACA to marriage equality to so much more.
*****************************
Kavanaugh failed to show he'll be an independent check against unlawful action by a President. He would not say whether a President must comply with subpoenas. He would not say whether a President could pardon himself. He would not decry scorched-earth attacks on law enforcement.
*****************************
After meeting with him, reviewing his record, and watching his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh has clearly failed to show he would be an independent check against executive power. He would threaten Supreme Court precedent on women's health, marriage equality, and more.

I will vote no.
*****************************
No, not knowing who the good guys are and who the bad guys are at a neo-Nazi rally is the "biggest ____ing mistake." https://t.co/MXDMrqm5T5

200,000 people—mostly health professionals—rely on this database each month, yet Trump’s administration is eliminating it, citing budget cuts.

Just yesterday, a Russian tied to the NRA was arrested for conspiracy to influence our politics - another reminder that this fight to protect Americans is ongoing.

Trump's comments today are so alarming because he's dismissing it all while future elections remain at risk.
*****************************
What we saw today from President Trump isn't just disgraceful; it makes Americans less safe. By siding with a hostile foreign power over American law enforcement, he is jeopardizing our future national security and emboldening our enemies.
*****************************
This is a sad, shameful moment for our great nation.

We will reclaim our values and reassert our global leadership. We'll turn the page on this dark chapter. But it won't happen on its own. We all must stand up—to side with U.S. law enforcement and to protect all Americans.
*****************************
More indictments prove, yet again, that hostile Russian actors targeted Americans with sophisticated crimes in 2016. This investigation must continue—unobstructed—to keep protecting Americans, safeguarding future elections, and holding criminals responsible for their actions.

Here's what I'm wondering about the #SCOTUSpick:

Will Judge Kavanaugh respect rulings to uphold the ACA? Will he safeguard ALL Americans' civil rights? Will he protect women's freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions? Will he be independent of this President?
*****************************
A shocking example of this Administration weakening America’s global reputation.

https://t.co/iMDYhRfXZ2
*****************************
This nominee also must be scrutinized for whether they will be a sufficiently independent Justice. Someone too loyal to a President who says he has the power to pardon himself and whose extreme actions may very well crowd the Supreme Court docket would be a major warning sign.
*****************************
We need to know:

Will you uphold the ACA, as prior rulings have? Pre-existing conditions may land on the docket.

Do you respect precedent on a woman’s constitutional freedom to make her own reproductive health decisions?

Will you respect equality protections for all Americans?
*****************************
I will meet with the #SCOTUS nominee to ask them important questions...
*****************************
The most important nomination the Senate considers is to the Supreme Court. The appointment is for life, and the Court’s decisions are hard to change and very consequential. A nominee should have a sufficient record to enable the public to know what kind of Justice they will be.
*****************************
Some thoughts on #SCOTUS ahead of President Trump’s expected naming of a nominee:
*****************************
When you mock John McCain...
And George H.W. Bush...
And Senator Tester...
And Senator Warren...
And the #MeToo movement...
And NATO...
And your own Justice Department...

But then say “Putin’s fine”

I can’t help but ask: President Trump, are you okay?

When it comes to military operations in Syria, President Trump seems to be acting like a king by trying to unilaterally start a war. That’s unacceptable. As I also said with the Obama administration, any use of force like this demands a vote of Congress. https://t.co/nIUxi8nfvW

We can’t keep going on like this. Too many in elected office ignore cries for action—from parents who lost a child, students who lost a friend. These voices speaking truth to power should be the ones we wake up every day to represent. If we don’t, we are failing. #StudentsStandUp

I hope President Trump takes to heart the moving stories he heard today, and we finally act to meaningfully curb gun violence. These powerful voices should spur us to put politics aside and enact new gun safety measures that make our kids, schools and communities safer.

Our bipartisan plan to protect Dreamers from deportation got *15* more votes than the Trump plan. This was a sensible plan to solve the problem. President Trump chose to tank it to push a much more cruel and restrictive plan—and it failed. Bigly.
*****************************
Despite President Trump’s actions, I refuse to give up on protecting Dreamers from deportation. La lucha sigue — the fight continues.
*****************************
President Trump created a crisis when he unilaterally ended DACA. He asked Congress to clean up his mess, so we did—with a bipartisan plan to protect Dreamers and fund border security. But Trump refused to take yes for an answer and tanked the deal.
*****************************
The past few weeks, we’ve tried every approach to getting permanent protection for Dreamers. It’s been my primary focus in the immigration negotiations. I firmly believe the bipartisan deal today is our best chance to pass a bill to shield them from deportation.

My colleague @clairecmc also introduced a measure to keep our military paid during a shutdown. It was blocked by the Republican leader. The only reason I can imagine for this is that Sen. McConnell wants to inflict maximum pain during this #SenselessShutdown.

Last night, Senate Dems tried to pass a short, several-day bill to keep the government open as we concluded negotiations. Republicans blocked it. This is a #SenselessShutdown and if Rs would come to the table, we could end this impasse.

*****************************
If we get to work, and President Trump comes to the table, I believe we can finalize a long-term spending deal within a few days. Why won't Republican leadership even consider that? https://t.co/JcVFc2VuLB
*****************************
President Trump would rather sabotage negotiations on a spending bill via Twitter than be the dealmaker he claimed to be. Apparently coming to the table to craft a compromise is harder than hiding in "Executive Time."
*****************************
President Trump is cheerleading a shutdown, and his statements continue to heighten our budgetary dysfunction. He has to decide whether he wants to be President or continue acting like a political talk show host loudly offering inane, offensive commentary from the sidelines.
*****************************
In December, I voted to give negotiators time to reach a bipartisan agreement to permanently protect Dreamers and now they have a deal. This must be part of the negotiations, and there should be a vote on the compromise–or a clean Dream Act–without further delay.
*****************************
The current CR ignores key priorities—community health centers, permanent protection for Dreamers, emergency relief for FL/TX/CA/PR/USVIs, opioid treatment, and more. These issues are not going away and need to be addressed immediately.
*****************************
Repeated one-month CRs hurt all spending priorities and create deep uncertainty. The pain is particularly acute in Virginia—home to hundreds of thousands of government employees, kids who rely on CHIP, military families, Dreamers and national security professionals.
*****************************
Budgetary dysfunction is hurting our country and my Commonwealth. I oppose the current CR, and Congress should remain in session with no recess until we work out a long-term bipartisan budget deal that addresses all issues.
*****************************
One week ago, SecDef pleaded for an end to short-term spending deals. Now, House Rs are proposing another one—ignoring his request. We're 4 months into the fiscal year. We need a comprehensive deal! Why won't the Rs even try to govern? https://t.co/69r1U5bVK8

Here’s what total GOP control in DC looks like.

Republicans have until midnight tomorrow not to shut down the government, and they can't seem to get their act together.

A shutdown would devastate Virginia's economy and threaten or delay vital services for millions of Americans.

*****************************
This bill sends a message to the American people from the GOP: "We don't care." 

It's bad for our future, it's bad for families across Virginia and the entire country, it's bad for workers, it's bad for women, it's bad for kids, it's bad for seniors. 8/
*****************************
So we've got tax hikes for the middle class, health care at risk for millions. Next up? Workers: This bill does everything it can to make sure CEOs win and workers lose. Those are some backwards priorities if you ask me. 7/
*****************************
Yes, you read that right. Because it repeals the ACA's individual mandate, the bill would wreak havoc on health care and cause premiums to rise. 6/
*****************************
But let's just say, for argument's sake, that maybe the GOP doesn't care about anything I've listed so far (like the middle class or our future debt). How about this: The bill could result in 13 million fewer people having health insurance. 5/
*****************************
This is all clearly wrong. But let's look past the obvious and see what else the tax bill would do. For starters, it would add at least $1.4 TRILLION to the deficit over 10 years—saddling our kids and grandkids with even more debt. 4/
*****************************
And while middle-class families pay more, the top 1% would see an average of $32,510 in tax CUTS. Want to be even more appalled? The top 0.1%—making at least $5.1 *million* a year—would see an average tax cut of $208,060! 3/
*****************************
First, and very importantly: This tax bill very clearly puts large corporations and the wealthiest among us ahead of middle-class families. Full stop. By 2027, we would see a substantial tax hike for the middle class. 2/
*****************************
If you follow me on here, you probably already know that I think the GOP tax bill is bad news. But it's going to be voted on in the (very) near future, and I need you to speak out loud and clear against it. Here's why: 1/

Earlier this year, during the repeated (and failed) GOP efforts to repeal the ACA, I said that I suspected my GOP colleagues would use efforts to gut health care to fund their tax cut proposal. I am sad to say that's exactly what they're doing now.
*****************************
Today, Senate Rs also confirmed their plan will repeal health care reform's individual mandate—a move that could lead to an estimated 13 million Americans losing insurance and further sabotage of our insurance markets.
*****************************
This prompted immediate opposition from @AARP, among others—and rightly so. https://t.co/fcg8ScXJDj
*****************************
The nonpartisan CBO has announced that the GOP plan would cause $25 billion in cuts to Medicare. https://t.co/EQCA4MdMBD

Here are a few of the worst moves:
*****************************
Today has been a *big* day in the ongoing GOP effort to develop its tax plan. There's a lot swirling, so let me be very clear: the moves made today will hurt countless families, and they make this plan even worse.
*****************************
@PPAVirginia Thank you for all you do!
*****************************
President Trump should keep his promise to this Virginia island whose residents have put their faith in him. I’m ready to work together, but he has to follow through.

*****************************
Placing the burden on women, and eroding their opportunity to excel on the Hill, is exactly the wrong approach. It’s up to men to not subject women to harassment or assault in the workplace—not on women to avoid it. https://t.co/rl552E3MgC

Hollow promises and rearview-mirror sloganeering won’t do a thing to create jobs or make lives better in coal country. What’s needed are real investments in education, training and infrastructure—which this administration hasn’t made. https://t.co/ZArfQCss8a

Even GOP leaders are finally beginning to acknowledge that this plan could raise taxes on many middle class families. Too bad it took them getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar... https://t.co/3PBBMGUmV1

Sexual assault and abuse is an epidemic. Grateful for your bravery in telling your story, @diananyad. It's a shame that it's taken so many women sharing these private, horrific stories in such public ways in order for us to begin to confront this. https://t.co/o28hmVBOm8

I am also grateful for Leigh Corfman's courage and voice — all too often, our systemic biases against women's stories and perspectives make it too difficult for women to come forward.
*****************************
Today's revelations about Roy Moore are incredibly disturbing. We have to speak out against gross abuse like this. Moore should never be in the U.S. Senate. He should step aside—but if he won’t, the good people of Alabama must vote to defeat him.

What’s the end product? Families could pay even higher premiums to get care. More discrimination of those who need care most. More chaos.
*****************************
It aims to push healthy people onto junk plans, leaving only the sick or at-risk on ACA plans—essentially destroying the insurance market.

It would allow cheap low-quality plans onto the market that could discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, seniors, women...

2/ We were promised a “middle class miracle.” But from limited details they’ll share, looks like many in middle class could see increases.

#GrahamCassidy would've hurt countless Americans. I'll say it again: it's past time for us to work together to improve health care for all
*****************************

GOP Senators have one last chance to get this right: vote now to send it to Committee &amp; give the public a bipartisan debate on health care
*****************************
A vote for #SkinnyRepeal is salt in the wound for millions of American families who are worried about their health care.
*****************************
This is not a 'skinny' plan - it's a plan with terrible consequences resulting in millions of Americans losing health care
*****************************
How can GOP Senators vote yes on this 'disaster' of a bill? https://t.co/mcr1SiyL9I
*****************************
Virginia families could feel the impact of a skinny repeal bill right away. It would increase premiums 20% next year alone
*****************************
What happens with a skinny repeal? 16 million uninsured. Collapse of health care markets. 20% premium increase. Defunds Planned Parenthood

Make no mistake, once the Senate passes "skinny repeal" the House will send it to Trump to sign into law. Kicks millions off insurance.

GOP has dropped plan to use “skinny repeal” as a vehicle to get to a conference. Now House will pass it as is &amp; send to WH, hurting millions https://t.co/AeNvAdWMhO

We need everyone to make their voices heard today so we can stop this #TrumpCare bill in the Senate
*****************************
Still haven't seen the GOP health care bill we are voting on. Is this really how the GOP wants to conduct business on people's health care?
*****************************
Health care isn't a game, but Republicans are choosing to treat it like one. The Senate is better than this #SaveACA #ProtectOurCare

Reminder: ACA repeal would cause 32 MILLION people to lose insurance &amp; premiums to double. This would be devastating for American families.

Just voted NO on the Paul amendment to repeal the ACA. This is the jump-off-a-cliff-and-figure-out-later-how-to-land plan.
*****************************
I'm using this test for votes on GOP health care bills: will it raise costs for Virginians and/or take their care away? If so, I'll vote no
*****************************
GOP health care bill will cause Virginians to lose insurance &amp; pay much more for health care. Why aren't we helping people get better care?
*****************************
The stakes could not be higher when it comes to people's health care. Call your Senators to share your stories &amp; ask them to #SaveACA
*****************************
The message I'm hearing from families in every corner of VA: #SaveACA &amp; #ProtectOurCare. We were elected to help people, not hurt them

Headed to the floor for what might be my most monumental Senate vote yet. I'm voting NO on first step to take health care away from millions
*****************************
If we just take the time health care deserves, we can get this right
*****************************
Republicans haven't just shut Democrats out on the health care bill, they’ve shut out the American people. It's plain wrong.
*****************************
Why is GOP leadership forcing a vote on a secret bill without listening to patients, doctors &amp; American families about the consequences?

*****************************
Today's recap: we saw a bipartisan group of Governors, GOP Senators &amp; countless Americans reject an ACA repeal. The message is clear. https://t.co/ligBPNMd2y
*****************************
Pres Trump would rather hurt Americans by sabotaging the ACA than back a bipartisan solution that actually keeps his promises to the public
*****************************
To GOP: drop ACA repeal. Let's start enacting bipartisan reforms like reinsurance that will stabilize insurance market &amp; lower premiums
*****************************
The Senate has to move forward to make health care stronger, not destroy it. Repeal would double premiums &amp; 32 million would lose coverage
*****************************
Many of us have been pushing bipartisan approach for months. We're ready to work together to fix health care, @SenateMajLdr https://t.co/DsxSPJGdM8
*****************************
Headed to Senate floor. Virginians want us working on bipartisan health care fixes, not an ACA repeal bill that kicks millions off insurance
*****************************
.@SenJohnMcCain calls it right: Time for the committees to hold hearings and work in a bipartisan way to find solutions
*****************************
McConnell's new plan--repeal only--hurts millions of people and destabilizes the largest sector of our economy

The collapse of #TrumpCare is good news for America. Now let's work together to improve health care

HELP Cmte members are eager to work with GOP on health care fixes. There are good bills out there that would reduce costs, improve care
*****************************
What could be so bad about having the health care committees (HELP &amp; Finance) take a look and discuss health care?
*****************************
With #TrumpCare vote delayed, Senate should be using this week to hold public hearings &amp; listen to patients, families, doctors &amp; nurses
*****************************
GOP leaders should listen to the American people, drop the repeal effort &amp; start working with Democrats on health care fixes https://t.co/Lfqy8br079
*****************************
The end result for Americans under #TrumpCare: higher costs, less care. We should be working on bipartisan fixes to bring down costs
*****************************
#TrumpCare would allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions - that's just plain wrong
*****************************
By weakening essential health benefits under #TrumpCare, the GOP would expose older Americans to higher out-of-pocket costs
*****************************
Another broken promise. Pres Trump needs to ditch #TrumpCare. Cutting #Medicaid undermines states efforts to fight addiction &amp; save lives https://t.co/cRXRtk8A5M

*****************************
#Medicaid enables many kids to go to school, plain and simple. #Trumpcare cuts it, casting them aside for a tax break to the wealthy
*****************************
In Virginia, our children &amp; schools would be the largest demographic hurt by GOP plans to cut #Medicaid as part of #Trumpcare &amp; #TrumpBudget
*****************************
Schools rely on #Medicaid to provide special ed classes &amp; health-related services such as vision exams and mental health evaluations
*****************************
In most recent reporting years, Virginia public schools received nearly $33 million in federal #Medicaid funding. #Trumpcare would cut it
*****************************

#TrumpCare eliminaría la expansión de #Medicaid y le quitaría la cobertura que 3.2 millones de latinos obtuvieron con la #ACA
*****************************
#TrumpCare le quitará cobertura médica a muchos de los 4 millones de adultos y más de 600mil niños latinos que obtuvieron cobertura con #ACA
*****************************
#TrumpCare won't improve the quality of care for Americans or lower costs. ACA already works for millions. Let's improve it, not break it!
*****************************
Using #ACA anniversary as an arbitrary deadline to rush through #TrumpCare for symbolic reasons is ridiculous. GOP must take this seriously
*****************************
#TrumpCare ends the #ACA #Medicaid expansion &amp; dismantles the program as we know it. Bad for millions of Americans who depend on #Medicaid
*****************************
#TrumpCare would double the number of uninsured people under the age of 65
*****************************
The #ACA has insured over 20 million Americans in 7 years, while #TrumpCare stands to leave 24 million fewer people with health care
*****************************
It's the 7th anniversary of the #AffordableCareAct today, and we must protect this law that's helped millions of Americans
*****************************
VA's seniors can't afford #TrumpCare. We should be working to lower prescription drug costs for them, not unfairly increasing their premiums
*****************************
#TrumpCare still includes the Republican Age Tax, and people in their 50s and 60s will still see costs rise significantly
*****************************
#TrumpCare would result in an approximate $3,200 monthly premium increase for the average 64 year old
*****************************
#TrumpCare allows insurers to charge older adults 5x what they charge younger adults. This means higher costs for older Americans
*****************************
America stands by the UK's side. Thinking of our friends in London today in the aftermath of this tragic attack

https://t.co/Y7EW4rdeGu
*****************************
I’m ready to work w/ colleagues across the aisle on a realistic budget that charts a different path &amp; helps Virginians get ahead.
*****************************
And taking taxpayer dollars away from these VA priorities to pay for Pres Trump’s wall – which won’t make us safer - is not an option.
*****************************
A 13.5% cut to the Department of Education threatens our public schools, putting our teachers and students at risk
*****************************
The $4.7 B cut to the @USDA could jeopardize research investments at land-grant universities like @Virginia_Tech &amp; @NorfolkStateU
*****************************
The $2.4 B cut to @USDOT could jeopardize efforts we have in place to reduce the Metro maintenance backlog
*****************************
.@POTUS budget would eliminate Chesapeake Bay Program funding (despite promising clean water 2 weeks ago), hurting environment &amp; VA economy
*****************************
Drastic cuts threaten programs VA relies on for clean water, safe roads, well-funded public schools, and quality, affordable health care.
*****************************
Despite investments in defense, these budget cuts show me @POTUS is continuing to push policies that would hurt Virginians
*****************************
About to share my takeaways from President Trump’s budget and its potential impact on Virginia families…

*****************************
POTUS said no one will lose coverage under an ACA repeal. #TrumpCare shatters that promise, all to deliver a massive tax cut to the wealthy
*****************************
CBO report confirms our fears about #TrumpCare. 24 million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 under this bill
*****************************
Restrictions &amp; drastic cost increases for women’s health care services hurt our families and our economy #TrumpCare: https://t.co/jagnFMFFtv

I'm wearing red today to honor the commitments women have made to our workforce &amp; their contributions to society #DayWithoutWomen #IWD2017
*****************************
#Trumpcare doesn’t fix health care. It's a tax cut for the very wealthy. How much of a tax cut would Trump family get under this bill?
*****************************
#Trumpcare drives up costs for patients, but cuts the Tanning Tax . . . interesting 🤔
*****************************
#Trumpcare will cut taxes on the very wealthy, making average Americans pay more
*****************************
Young ppl in the pool bring costs down for everyone. So why is #Trumpcare creating a 30% lapsed-coverage surcharge? It's a #MillenialPenalty
*****************************
Reviewing #Trumpcare. Cuts @PPFA funds, hurting millions of women who go there for mammograms, maternity care, cancer screenings &amp; more
*****************************
Pay inequality costs AAPI women thousands of $$ over a lifetime. Families deserve economic security. #AAPIEqualPay
*****************************
And, the GOP is pushing the repeal and replace #Trumpcare bill through before the cost and coverage losses can be predicted. Terrible.
*****************************
House health care bill would cause uncertainty in people's lives &amp; economy, defund PP &amp; dismantle #Medicaid. I'll strongly oppose #Trumpcare

Read my statement on my decision to support the nomination of Gen Mattis and oppose the nomination of Rex Tillerson https://t.co/P8vjPRig26
*****************************
The Sec State needs to put US interests above any other loyalty. Mr. Tillerson did not give me confidence in his ability to do that
*****************************
Tillerson's answers on Russia and refusals to answer on ExxonMobil makes me question whether he could set aside the interests of ExxonMobil
*****************************
Rex Tillerson, however, made many comments during his confirmation hearing that caused me concern
*****************************
Gen Mattis appreciates challenges facing servicemembers &amp; is committed to strong civilian/military understanding. I support his confirmation
*****************************
The US needs military and diplomatic leadership that understands our national security threats &amp; is fully committed to the US above all else
