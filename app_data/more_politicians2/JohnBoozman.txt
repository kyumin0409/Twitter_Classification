Should #SESTA pass, and I believe it will, these bad actors won’t be able to fade quietly into the dark. We're going to give state attorneys general the authority to prosecute websites that violate federal sex trafficking laws. That’s why I support this bill.
*****************************
It’s time to rip the cover away from these bad actors. We are going to do that by making narrowly-crafted changes to the law to ensure websites that knowingly facilitate criminal sex trafficking online are held accountable.
*****************************
#SESTA will help by giving law enforcement and prosecutors additional tools to crack down on human trafficking. It will help us take on nefarious actors like Backpage, who hid behind the Communications Decency Act to avoid prosecution for trafficking crimes.
*****************************
Fortunately, our state is fighting back. Last year Arkansas legislators approved a law requiring state-licensed truckers to be trained in spotting the red flags of human trafficking.

Joined my @EPWGOP colleagues in letter to @EPAScottPruitt supporting repeal of the burdensome Clean Power Plan. It's a poorly conceived policy that's overreaching, unlawful, would cost American #jobs, raise #energy prices &amp; hurt communities. Full letter: https://t.co/cHy8YihtKh

Today I spoke on the #Senate floor to highlight the positive impacts our historic tax reform law will have on the agricultural industry. Watch this video for the full speech. https://t.co/tUybHSpIkS
*****************************
I am proud of our efforts to pass this landmark #taxreform law and am confident that it will have lasting, positive effects on our economy.
*****************************
That's why we took great care to ensure that the agr industry would see the benefits of tax reform. Establishing a tax code that works for our farmers and ranchers, as opposed to against them, is vital to their ability to plan for the future and invigorate rural economies.
*****************************
My colleagues and I on the #Ag Committee under the steadfast leadership of @SenPatRoberts are working hard to reauthorize the #FarmBill. Programs authorized by the Farm Bill are absolutely vital to farmers, ranchers and consumers &amp; will provide more certainty in rural America.
*****************************
Uncertainty is devastating to our economy. There are few industries that are inherently more affected by uncertainty than #agriculture. We've taken steps to eliminate some of the punitive, needless #regulations that create uncertainty for our #farmers and #ranchers.
*****************************
Finally #farmers &amp; #ranchers will be able to expense 100% of their capital investments, such as equipment, over the next 4 years. In his address to @FarmBureau earlier this week @POTUS called that the “sleeper” in the bill. He’s right. It will be good for family-run ag operations
*****************************
97% of the farms in #Arkansas are family owned, and the vast majority of them will now be exempt from the estate tax. This is a big deal. It will help keep those #farms and #ranches in the family for generations to come.
*****************************
@SenateAgGOP &gt;94% of #farms are organized as pass-through businesses, meaning they're impacted by the same #tax provisions as individuals. Lower tax rates across the board and a 20% deduction on their taxable income means immediate savings, which can be reinvested to help grow the operation.
*****************************
@SenateAgGOP #Agriculture is Arkansas's largest industry, adding around $16B to our economy annually &amp; accounting for nearly 1 in 6 jobs. We're in the nation’s top 10 producers of a number of #ag commodities. #TaxReform helps create an economic environment where the ag industry can thrive.

*****************************
This hearing has been a productive start to the conversation that must continue re: investments to upgrade &amp; improve water infrastructure.
*****************************
As Mr. Frazee points out, quality of life improves dramatically after getting access to reliable, clean drinking water &amp; wastewater.
*****************************
Another witness at our hearing, Andrew Kricun, notes that emergency repairs to water infrastructure cost 5-7x more &amp; aren't cost effective.
*****************************
The Water Systems Council has provided Mike, his neighbors, and families across #AR w/ quality drinking water through its Water Well Trust.
*****************************
Mike Frazee of Rogers, #AR is now testifying before the committee abt the challenges related to rural communities' access to drinking water.
*****************************
The time to act is now. We have an opportunity to develop an infrastructure bill to directly address drinking water &amp; wastewater challenges.
*****************************
Small, rural communities in Arkansas are working to update aging &amp; deficient water systems. They face unique challenges in this effort.
*****************************
We can use a variety of tools (public-private partnerships, private financing, state &amp; fed. funding) to invest in water infrastructure.
*****************************
Estimated 1.7M Americans live w/o access to clean, running drinking water in their homes. We have the opportunity to address this problem.
*****************************
We tend to imagine communities w/o access to clean &amp; efficient drinking and wastewater as far-off countries, but it occurs in America too.
*****************************
This isn't a rural problem or a big city problem, R or D problem. It's a national emergency &amp; we need to find solutions before it's too late
*****************************
Currently the ASCE grades America’s drinking water infrastructure with a D, waste water has a slightly better grade of a D+.
*****************************
I'm chairing a Senate EPW subcommittee hearing about ways to fix America's crumbling water infrastructure. WATCH: https://t.co/booFCjBHqu

I will continue to work to promote policies that help U.S remain competitive &amp; create jobs while pushing for human rights &amp; change in Cuba.
*****************************
Through this approach, we not only trade goods, but ideas. The two go hand-in-hand.
*****************************
It would be more effective to continue an open line of communication &amp; working relationship w/a government in need of democratic assistance
*****************************
By rolling back reforms that have benefited U.S. citizens, everyday Cubans and our economy, we are taking a step backward, not forward.
*****************************
But a return to embargo-like policies is the wrong approach. We ran this play over and over again for 50 years &amp; results have not changed.
*****************************
I share the President’s desire to see democracy take hold in Cuba, as well as his commitment to ending the regime's human rights abuses
