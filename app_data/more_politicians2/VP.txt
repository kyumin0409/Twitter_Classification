I met George HW Bush in 1988 when he was Vice President. I was struck by his approachability. There was a kindness about the man that was evident to everyone who met him. All his years in public service were characterized by kindness, modesty &amp; patriotism. #Remembering41 https://t.co/9JVHJx2V08

*****************************
…That may well describe the essence of this man. And it may well have been his vision - the vision he had for his life, his children, his children’s children, and his country – no barriers, no boundaries, no limits. #Remembering41
*****************************
President Bush once wrote in a letter to his children that #CAVU “describes my own life as it has been over the years, as it is right now” – Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited..
*****************************
…He took America to war to repel aggression &amp; through his leadership as commander-in-chief &amp; the brilliance of our armed forces, the US won a decisive victory in the Persian Gulf. When President Bush left office, he left America &amp; the world more peaceful, prosperous &amp; secure.
*****************************
President Bush served during an uncertain time - made momentous by his leadership. He oversaw the fall of the Soviet Union, the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, and under his leadership, America won the Cold War…
*****************************

Spoke with @DanaBashCNN about @POTUS’ selection of Judge Kavanaugh. When you look at his extraordinary volume of work - more than 300 opinions - you can see the kind of principled jurist who fits right in the model of a Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Justice Antonin Scalia. https://t.co/ZOFLOzuViv
*****************************
As I told @BretBaier, Judge Kavanaugh is someone that has the character, background, career &amp; the record that gave @POTUS Trump the confidence to know he would be another constitutional conservative who would faithfully interpret the Constitution as written. https://t.co/S1m0zRbflk
*****************************
As I told @RushLimbaugh, there’s an @NRO story on Judge Kavanaugh’s remarks about Justice Scalia back in 2016. He describes Justice Scalia as someone who was and remains a hero and role model to him. Read the @NRO story here: https://t.co/gOMB0pDSom https://t.co/IGMdtyr8wZ

Spoke to @HoppyKercheval in WV about @Sen_JoeManchin's choice - whether he's going to stand with Chuck Schumer &amp; liberals in Washington DC who are prepared to oppose the most qualified &amp; most deserving nominee to the Supreme Court, or whether he will stand with @POTUS’ nominee. https://t.co/gE8wSEnyWb

Wherever your duties take you, stay true to the inscription on the Quarterdeck of Chase Hall – “Who Lives Here Reveres Honor, Honors Duty.”

Hold fast to those words that you chose as your class motto: “Sacrifice of Self, Service to Others.”
*****************************
Officers, you have been called to serve. Practice servant leadership in the care, the concern, and the attention that you, as officers, demonstrate to the courageous men and women of the @USCoastGuard who you lead – and you will succeed.
*****************************
As commissioned officers, you’re called not just to lead, but also to serve those under your watch. And this will be one of the greatest honors of your lives – for the @USCoastGuard is filled with the toughest, bravest, and most dedicated Americans.
*****************************
At this very moment, the world’s most dangerous terrorist and criminal organizations are working to gain a foothold across the Western Hemisphere, to threaten our people and our very way of life.
*****************************
As you’ve seen during your summer assignments, security risks that were once confined to far flung corners of the world are now closer to endangering our homeland than ever before – from nuclear proliferation to radical Islamic terrorism, and the rogue regimes that finance both.
*****************************
As you prepare to assume your duties as officers in the @USCoastGuard, you do so at a time of historic investment in our Armed Forces – as you accept the responsibility to lead Coast Guardsmen and women, I promise you: your Commander-in-Chief will always have your back.
*****************************
You were called to serve. 

You answered that call by coming here, to this Academy, and dedicating your talents and your energy to saving lives, enforcing our nation’s laws, and securing our homeland in times of peace and in times of war.
*****************************
It is my great honor to join you today at the 137th commencement ceremony for this exceptional institution – to celebrate the achievements and boundless future ahead of the 208 extraordinary cadets graduating today – the @USCGAcademy Class of 2018! https://t.co/VYnk1S1EUI

As @POTUS said, “No child or teacher should ever be in danger in an American school…It's not enough to simply take action that make us feel like we're making a difference.

*****************************
Time and time again, this @POTUS has made it clear to the men and women of law enforcement: We are with you. We stand with you. #PoliceWeek https://t.co/Rb2YL45JJ2

Under @POTUS Donald Trump, we will always fight for you – we will always support you – and we will never stop striving to be worthy of your noble service and sacrifice. #PoliceWeek
*****************************
You are the peace keepers, the shield for the innocent and vulnerable, the guardians standing between us and violence and lawlessness.
*****************************
The fallen heroes we remember today all answered the same call of duty to protect and serve. And their hearts were filled with the same selfless courage… and love. For “no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.” #PoliceWeek
*****************************
This year alone, we’ve seen attacks that have claimed the lives of 28 heroes.
*****************************
But as all of you know – and as this day of remembrance so vividly reminds us – there is much work to be done to ensure the safety and security of our law enforcement. #PoliceWeek

As it has been in the past, so it shall be in the future: America stands with Israel. https://t.co/OI6PbAwXfA
*****************************
As we look at Israel today, it is extraordinary to behold all the progress she has made, and the example that she sets. Today, the modern State of Israel is not only 70 years old – Israel is 70 years strong. https://t.co/8z1p2dW23f
*****************************
Israel will go from strength to strength – and her first 70 years will just be a glimpse of what’s to come – and the United States and Israel will meet our glorious future together.
*****************************
And we stand with Israel because that’s what Americans have always done – for in the story of Israel, we see the power of faith, and the promise of hope.
*****************************
We stand with Israel because her cause is our cause, her values are our values, and her fight is our fight. 

We stand with Israel because we believe in right over wrong, good over evil, and liberty over tyranny.
*****************************
And so today, let me assure you all… the United States of America will never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon – that is our solemn promise to Israel and to the world!
*****************************
As @POTUS said, the Iran deal “didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” In fact, Iran’s unprecedented missile attacks on Israel last week only confirmed the President’s decision, and this dangerous act of aggression only strengthened our resolve.
*****************************
By finally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the United States has chosen fact over fiction – and fact is the only true foundation for a just and lasting peace. And as @POTUS Trump made clear this morning, “our greatest hope is for peace.”
*****************************
Just as President Truman made history then, @POTUS Trump has made history now — thanks to @POTUS’ leadership, almost exactly 70 years to the minute since the rebirth of the Jewish State, the American Embassy officially opened in Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel!
*****************************
It is my distinct honor to accept this unique recognition, from the State of Israel, for the greatest defender of the Jewish State ever to sit in the Oval Office. I know the President is honored by this expression of the high esteem and great affection from the people of Israel.
*****************************
It is deeply humbling to stand here with you on this extraordinary day – as we celebrate 70 Years of Israel’s Independence.

*****************************
It was in Jerusalem that King David consecrated the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. Since its rebirth, the modern State of Israel has called Jerusalem the seat of its government. Today @POTUS &amp; the American people acknowledge this historic truth w the opening of the US Embassy. https://t.co/tTNSJQVftq
*****************************
The miracle of Israel is an inspiration to the world. And the United States of America is proud to stand with Israel and her people, as allies and cherished friends. https://t.co/hsPHWY6ggN

To the graduates of @Hillsdale: You are beginning your careers at a time of a growing American economy and restored American stature at home and abroad. Faith in America is rising once again. https://t.co/WK84wMJcWz
*****************************
Congratulations to the @Hillsdale College Class of 2018. 

Right after WE get done making this nation great again, I know YOUR generation will make America greater than ever before.
*****************************
The most heroic acts &amp; greatest feats aren’t the stuff of headlines &amp; fame. They’re actually the daily choices that you make &amp; the habits you’ve already begun to form.

Ultimately, whether you renew America comes down to whether you live what you have learned at @Hillsdale.
*****************************
Your education in the liberal arts has empowered you to conserve the foundations of our freedom… and you are now uniquely suited – and I believe you are uniquely called – to renew the fabric of our national life.
*****************************
I encourage you to take your deepest-held convictions into every facet of your life – and add your voices, and your values, to this new American awakening.
*****************************
Faith has always been the wellspring of hope for millions of Americans, and from our Founding, faith has been the foundation of our freedom, and religion essential to our republic.
*****************************
Religion in America isn’t receding – just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life with every passing day.
*****************************
The percentage of Americans who live out their religion on a weekly basis – by praying, going to church, and reading and believing in the Bible – has remained remarkably consistent over the decades, even as the population of the United States has grown by leaps and bounds.
*****************************
We live in a time when traditional values, even religious conviction, are increasingly marginalized by a secular popular culture – a time when it's become acceptable, even fashionable, to malign religious belief. I still believe with all my heart that FAITH in America is rising.
*****************************
Faith in America is rising again because @POTUS Trump and our entire administration have been advancing the very principles that you learned here in the halls of @Hillsdale College.
*****************************
Here at home, businesses large and small are growing again – more than 3.1 million new jobs, unemployment at a 17-year low, and the best news of all for you new graduates today, there are more job openings across America than any time in the history of this country.
*****************************
On the world stage, you’ve seen America embracing our role as leader of the free world – with action just this week regarding Iran, North Korea, and on Monday, America will lead the world again when we open our new Embassy in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel!
*****************************
The America that awaits your energies and ambitions is experiencing a new era of opportunity and optimism.

You are beginning your careers at a time of a growing American economy and a restored American stature at home and abroad. And faith in America is rising again!
*****************************
Your education at @Hillsdale has taught you not what to do, but what to be – and today, you will receive a diploma that has been minted in independence and tempered with truth.

*****************************
.@POTUS changed the policies of the US from an era of strategic patience to the kind of campaign that would bring econ &amp; diplomatic pressure to bear. To see these 3 Americans come off the plane we hope is a sign this is a real opportunity to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula. https://t.co/AHt0yCW7S0
*****************************
.@POTUS Trump found a way to communicate in terms, I believe, that Kim Jong Un could finally hear. He could hear that this president was serious about achieving the objective that has eluded the world community for a quarter century – denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. https://t.co/Ezh1tBTn5i
*****************************
To be able to have an opportunity to visit with the detainees on the tarmac was deeply moving to Karen and me. To hear their expressions of support for @POTUS, their gratitude to the Country &amp; for the prayers of the American people, I'll remember the rest of my life. https://t.co/J1zvCdCoHq

Talking with @DLoesch about @POTUS Trump's first year, our administration's priorities for 2018, our support for the Iranian protesters &amp; my upcoming trip to the Middle East. Listen this afternoon at: https://t.co/EfPt4fLOke
*****************************
Under @POTUS, 2017 was a year of extraordinary accomplishment:
✓ Rebuilding military
✓ Regulatory reform
✓ Appointments to courts to uphold rule of law
✓ Tax reform
✓ Repealing the Obamacare mandate

And in 2018 we'll continue to create a stronger &amp; more prosperous America! https://t.co/9Dt1HrTsyg
*****************************
I'm even more confident, after this weekend's discussion, that with @POTUS’ leadership and the strong leadership in the Congress, we are going to keep delivering for the American people in 2018. #MAGA https://t.co/FcHWcFZjqU
*****************************
.@POTUS' policies have been achieving extraordinary results.

✓ Nearly two million jobs created 
✓ Unemployment at a 17 year row

But as the President said at the close of 2017, we're just getting started. https://t.co/48H9VlNbg8
*****************************
.@HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP leaders and our entire administration are working on @POTUS Trump's Make America Great Agenda - productive day at Camp David. #MAGA https://t.co/dPK2q15bbE
*****************************
.@POTUS Trump knows just how important manufacturing is to our nation's success and our people's prosperity. And thanks to the America First agenda, confidence &amp; manufacturing is back. This administration will continue to fight tirelessly for American manufacturers. #MAGA https://t.co/8bM0yEqJa5
*****************************
Robert Barro, professor of economics at Harvard, on @POTUS' pro-GROWTH tax cuts: "cutting income taxes on individuals will power economic growth in the short run, and reforming them for businesses will do the same over the long haul." Read his @WSJ op-ed: https://t.co/BcbJg3FtIF
*****************************
.@POTUS’ pro-JOBS agenda has already resulted in more than 1.8 million NEW JOBS for hardworking Americans, and in 2018 and beyond, our administration will continue to fight for good-paying jobs for the American people. #MAGA https://t.co/uvTcYKcd0V

*****************************
The U.S has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Unfortunately, many of our European partners, as well as the United Nations, have thus far failed to forcefully speak out on the growing crisis in Iran. It’s time for them to stand up. 

Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/9aPzsxAGuD
*****************************
Today, the Iranian people are once again rising up to demand freedom and opportunity, and under @POTUS Trump, the United States is standing with them. This time, we will not be silent. 

Read my op-ed in the @WashingtonPost: https://t.co/9aPzsxAGuD
*****************************
.@VOANews: "2018 vs 2009: The Trump administration's quick embrace of the Iran demonstrations contrasts with the Obama administration's more muted response to street protests in 2009 that lasted for months before dissipating under a deadly gov't crackdown" https://t.co/TXjjvgli24
*****************************
.@POTUS Trump made it clear: America will not be bullied, America will not be threatened, and the United States of America has managed to marshal an unprecedented amount of economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. https://t.co/L0kK52AYuY
*****************************
The United States of America is going to continue to send an unambiguous message that the American people stand with freedom-loving people in Iran and around the world. #IranProtests https://t.co/o5JmgsVzPE
*****************************
I remember in 2009 people in Iran demonstrating incredible courage for a democratic &amp; free future. We looked to the White House in 2009 for American leadership &amp; there was none. Today the U.S stands w/ Iranians who want a better, more prosperous &amp; freer future. #IranProtests https://t.co/dyYsr5wuaE

*****************************
The contrast between the silence and the failure to support freedom in the last administration, and @POTUS Trump's unapologetic willingness to stand w/ the courageous people of Iran - I know it is giving hope to the people on the streets of those cities across Iran. #IranProtests
*****************************
Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. To see the people of Iran rising up to demand change in their country should hearten every freedom-loving American and people who cherish freedom around the world. #IranProtests
*****************************
As I told @Greta during our interview for @VOAnews, the clear affirmation &amp; support that @POTUS Trump has provided to protestors rising up in cities across Iran is dramatic &amp; consistent with America's role in the world as a leading champion of freedom. #IranProtests
*****************************

*****************************
Protesters in Iran should know there's bipartisan support in America for the freedom-loving people of Iran who continue to fight against their government’s corruption and tyranny. #IranProtests https://t.co/PvOZoacOwD
*****************************
We need freedom loving people everywhere to stand w/ Iranian people &amp; against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps- who are restricting basic freedoms &amp; plundering Iran’s money to support terrorism abroad instead of helping hardworking Iranians in their own nation. #IranProtests

*****************************
As long as @RealDonaldTrump is POTUS and I am VP, the United States of America will not repeat the shameful mistake of our past when others stood by and ignored the heroic resistance of the Iranian people as they fought against their brutal regime... (1/2)
*****************************
Here’s the great news: 2017 was just a warm up. 2018 is going to be bigger and better than ever for Americans because @POTUS &amp; I are just getting started! Karen and I wish you a Happy New Year! #MAGA #AmericaFirst https://t.co/XV2Pgx6fJ7
