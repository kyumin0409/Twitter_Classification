Given what happened I find myself thinking, “we were lucky.” Not that we were hit by a major earthquake, but in that it could have been so much worse. Alaskans were prepared—just as you would expect us to be. We are tough, resilient, &amp; will come back from this stronger than ever.
*****************************
.@SenDanSullivan &amp; I flew home this weekend to assess the damage. We have major work ahead to rebuild our roads, schools, ports, &amp; other structures that were damaged. For example, more than 85 schools sustained enough damage that they need time to be cleaned up and repaired.
*****************************
Early reports came in from 1st responders who had quickly jumped into action, while civil engineers were dispatched to check on highways, bridges, &amp; essential infrastructure like hospitals. We waited to hear reports of serious injuries &amp; fatalities, which fortunately, never came.
*****************************
My staff in AK called saying that pipes had burst in their houses. One of the main roads in Anchorage had parts of it collapse, trapping cars. In schools across Anchorage &amp; Mat-Su Valley, students hid under desks to “duck &amp; cover” as things crashed to the floor around them.

*****************************
It was gut wrenching to be in Houston Middle School &amp; to imagine what it was like for the students Friday morning when the quake hit.

Alaskans are incredibly resilient but that doesn’t mean that when you’re hit with something of this intensity it doesn’t have a substantial and devastating impact. The message I want to convey to friends, family, and Alaskans across the state is that we are on top of this.
*****************************
The impact is very real and will require a great deal of recovery and effort, but I have been assured that Alaskans will have what they need to deal with and recover from this very serious earthquake.

It’s always helpful to understand what’s happening on the ground and steps that are being taken to maintain Alaska’s infrastructure, especially one of the world’s largest pipeline systems.
*****************************
I visited the @AlyeskaPipeline Terminal in Valdez, the end of the line for the 800-mile-long Trans Alaska Pipeline System. I learned about new methods and tools Alyeska is utilizing to conduct pipe inspections, both externally &amp; internally, thanks to technology advances. https://t.co/wfuks7pGB5
*****************************
SERVS was established to prevent oil spills &amp; provide oil spill response services to the Trans Alaska Pipeline marine oil shippers. The new vessels are truly state-of-the-art but equally important, the training &amp; efforts by crews to prioritize safety &amp; protecting the environment. https://t.co/j6k7FBY8fC
*****************************
In Valdez I had an up-close look at the new Ship Escort/Response Vessel System (SERVS) fleet. I went onboard a 146 ft long, 52 ft wide @EdisonChouestAK escort tug --one of the new tugs to assist tankers in the safe navigation through Prince William Sound. https://t.co/3K8gjqDi0y

Proud to attend a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony in Anchorage this weekend for five Filipino veterans who served in WWII — a long overdue recognition for their service in fighting for our country. https://t.co/cuOmNYop4C
*****************************
As a result of this discovery, not only are individuals in the village motivated to replicate some of the pieces, but they have also inspired a cultural curriculum to be developed for Kuinerrarmiut Elitnaurvik School—both great efforts to help keep the Yup’ik culture alive. https://t.co/qSY2NNwgpw
*****************************
Fast forward to today, the village of Quinhagak has created a local museum to house the 70,000+ artifacts that have been uncovered. During my visit I had the amazing opportunity to see everything from baskets, masks, and spoons, to knives, ulus, and jewelry. https://t.co/amnOAUAMTE
*****************************
In 2009, archeologists from the University of Aberdeen and other international institutions alongside village residents, including children, began excavating artifacts from an ancient site called Nunalleq near the village of Quinhagak. https://t.co/7jRNhI3lMH

*****************************
The clinic is in very rough shape. This visit was a reminder that as we move forward in our work to improve healthcare, we must ensure that remote communities have the resources and infrastructure they need to provide adequate care. https://t.co/TyORm0QPxu
*****************************
One of the things I heard over and over during my visit to Quinagak was the need for a new clinic. I had a chance to stop in and see the existing facility which sees about 25 patients a day through the care of 5 community health aids. https://t.co/uqwc5Mu9Ss

With severe rain and flooding causing a real threat to the community of Seward, this is an important step towards finding a long-term solution.
*****************************
One of the provisions I secured in America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which was recently signed into law, requires the Army Corps to perform a Lowell Creek flood control study, a feasibility study that will help develop options to deal with this flood control system. https://t.co/Lmp6mwzlYu
*****************************
Lowell Creek tunnel is a 2,070-foot-long passage that helps protect the City of Seward from damaging floodwaters by diverting the water through Bear Mountain to a waterfall south of the city. Unfortunately, the tunnel is in need of major repair. https://t.co/jlNnsBdWlL

*****************************
From our experience in operating microgrids and distributed sources of power generation, to the testing grounds for unmanned aerial systems, as well as areas of telehealth &amp; telemedicine, Alaska is an #Arctic leader. #ArcticCircle2018
*****************************
During @ArcticAssembly opening session I spoke to how Alaskans are driven to pursue responsible economic development while addressing the challenges of a harsh &amp; fragile environment, and acting as good stewards to preserve our resources and our way of life for future generations. https://t.co/pWKWEMgYm2
*****************************
It is an honor to have Alaska spotlighted during #ArcticCircle2018. From energy innovation to community adaptation and scientific research, Alaskans are leading the way and looking to collaborate with international partners.

Yesterday I shadowed Robyn Harris, 2018 Alaska Secondary Principal of the Year. Robyn leads a dedicated team of teachers to create a caring, positive school environment where students work hard and are finding success.
*****************************
Alaska is no stranger to students that face these types of obstacles, so it’s encouraging to see Whaley’s use of the “Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports” model, coupled with a “meet students where they are” attitude, to help facilitate a climate and culture of care.
*****************************
Today I shadowed Robyn Harris, 2018 Alaska Secondary Principal of the Year.

I was honored to receive the American Gas Association’s Natural Gas Century Leader Award last week for my longstanding support of this vital industry, which continues to help power us toward a cleaner energy future. https://t.co/ksVAM8PE5E
*****************************
As our climate changes, we need to find responsible ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. And, thanks in large part to natural gas, our emissions have dropped in seven of the past 10 years, and are now 14 percent below the 2005 levels. https://t.co/fhAWV8LKJj
*****************************
Yesterday the President signed into law the Music Modernization Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored, which will bring the music industry up to speed with the evolving 21st century market and ensure that artists are fairly compensated for their work.
*****************************
The arrival of internet completely changed the game for the music industry. With a variety of streaming services having been developed, many songwriters &amp; producers are either not being paid royalties when their songs are played, or they aren’t paid market value for their work. https://t.co/NX0pPVnRPL
*****************************
Hundreds of millions of people would be left in the dark, power lines no longer energized, and generating stations would be off.  America can’t operate without electricity service, and we must have plans in place to restore power to our grid.
*****************************
Today I chaired an ENR hearing on #blackstart, which is process of restoring energy to the power grid after a system-wide blackout. The US has never seen a blackout of this kind, where everyone living within an interconnected electrical system loses power. https://t.co/zXqA5Wsqq1
*****************************
Healthy oceans are vital to a healthy economy &amp; all aspects of our lives. Thanks @SenDanSullivan &amp; @SenWhitehouse for their work to address the global marine debris issue as their legislation the Save Our Seas Act was signed into law today.
*****************************
Much of rural Alaska still lacks access to broadband internet service. The FCC needs to do better to reach tribal populations. Establishing broadband infrastructure will enhance the lives of Native Alaskans &amp; also advance safe/environmentally responsible maritime activity.
*****************************
During an @IndianCommittee hearing we examined Government Accountability Office re: broadband internet availability on tribal lands. The GAO found that less than 1% of FCC &amp; about 14% of Rural Utility Service funding went to tribes &amp; tribally-owned providers—unacceptably low. https://t.co/vAK2ItTJD6
*****************************
These short-term plans are helpful for a state like Alaska where our employment base is very seasonal. For Alaskans in the tourism, construction, or fishing industries, flexibility in duration of coverage is so important.
*****************************
About 18,000 Alaskans are enrolled on the individual exchange &amp; roughly 15,000 have chosen to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than purchase insurance because it is too expensive. Short-term plans are a viable &amp; affordable option.
*****************************
I spoke on the Senate Floor why I opposed an effort in the Senate to overturn a Trump Admin rule expanding the time that consumers can keep short-term health insurance plans. Alaskans need that flexibility in duration of coverage. https://t.co/ACw8Rhv5Ym
*****************************
This is great news for our state as it ensures Alaskans won’t be taxing our own salmon products as they return to the U.S. for domestic consumption. 
 https://t.co/oTxu9zGcaR
*****************************
I commend the @USTradeRep on their announcement that certain AK salmon will be excluded from the list of seafood imports subject to tariffs, allowing AK seafood producers who send salmon to China for limited processing to reimport those products to the U.S., tariff-free.
*****************************
I have been concerned about the impact that China’s tariffs on American seafood will have on Alaska’s economy and urged President Trump to work towards a trade policy with China that protects these critical markets for our seafood industry.
*****************************
The hydropower-related provisions will help streamline the permitting process, reduce costs, and allow for the continued consideration of the Mahoney Lake project. I’m proud of our work on this bill and look forward to the president signing it into law.
*****************************
America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 will provide safe drinking water for our communities &amp; invest in needed water infrastructure, ranging from ports to water storage, in Alaska &amp; across our country.
*****************************
Working closely with leaders on the Senate Committee on Environment &amp; Public Works, including @SenDanSullivan, and @HouseCommerce I was able to secure a number of water infrastructure &amp; hydropower-related provisions that will benefit AK. https://t.co/sIqEgphBxm

*****************************
The Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee advanced the Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act. This will help ensure that Alaska Natives who left home to serve during the Vietnam War are finally able to receive their land allotments.
*****************************
The importance of the FAA Reauthorization bill cannot be understated. Aviation isn’t just a means of transportation for Alaskans – it means food deliveries, access to medical treatment, and basic necessities. Aviation is truly a lifeline in Alaska. https://t.co/yLzS6GnFxe
*****************************
Today the Senate passed a 5-year FAA Reauthorization bill, which enhances security at airports, improves safety measures, makes travel easier for passengers, reauthorizes the Essential Air Service-- vital to so many of our communities. https://t.co/2RPVMj0fPJ
*****************************
We also advanced several measures important to Alaska. Our ability to report these measures, almost always in a #bipartisan manner, is a reflection of the significant time that members and staff alike have devoted to them. https://t.co/FSkslOLyZz
*****************************
Yesterday I chaired an Energy Committee business meeting where we advanced 40 bills to the Senate Floor. Among them was the #RestoreOurParks Act, that will help ensure these ‘crown jewels’ and the historic sites within them can be enjoyed by future generations.

Proud this bill was included in the recently passed Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, which will help fight the opioid crisis impacting our country. https://t.co/gjMjiTxgLA
*****************************
In May, I introduced the National Milestones to Measure Progress in Ending the Opioid Epidemic Act, w/ @SenMarkey which requires the federal government to set benchmarks for how it is addressing the opioid crisis in and by measuring progress on key objectives each year.
*****************************
Year after year Alaska tops the charts with having some of the highest suicide rates in the country. We know that one suicide is too many, and it has become far too prevalent in our Native communities. Together, we can give Alaskans the support they need and ultimately, hope. https://t.co/6HSak7Fsma
*****************************
.@SenWarren &amp; I introduced the Native American Suicide Prevention Act. This bipartisan effort will ensure Native communities have a seat at the table in developing &amp; implementing statewide suicide intervention &amp; prevention strategies. https://t.co/dUFPEjUr7c

*****************************
During a Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions Committee hearing focused on reducing healthcare costs by making healthcare information on cost and quality more transparent, I spoke to the challenges in Alaska and the need to improve healthcare cost transparency. https://t.co/zyPQSTdXYM
*****************************
In Alaska and the rest of the nation, patients rarely know the cost of medical services before receiving care, and costs can vary significantly depending on where one chooses to receive care.
*****************************
One measure of mine w/ @SenTinaSmith included in the opioid package was the Improving Access to Mental Health Services Act, which will allow greater flexibility for trained professionals to serve in schools and communities. https://t.co/0i856tOzgQ
*****************************
In Alaska, one of the difficulties we face in addressing the opioid crisis is the shortage of healthcare workers and professional help. Within the recently passed Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, I secured provisions to help address the workforce shortage in Alaska. https://t.co/luvB7WDZbJ
*****************************
It will bolster our defense capabilities by modernizing existing facilities, strengthening training &amp; emphasizing importance of developing Alaska’s strategic military presence in the Arctic. This bill is significant to the economic prosperity &amp; security of our nation &amp; Alaska.
*****************************
This bill invests in Alaskan futures by directing funds to programs that will support high-quality, locally-led job training and education initiatives.
*****************************
The Senate passed a funding pkg that includes the largest pay raise for troops in nearly a decade, funding for a new national firefighter cancer registry, and support for high quality educational opportunities for Alaskans of all ages---just to name a few. https://t.co/G4XRPOtwmB

This all-encompassing bill package, addresses prevention, treatment, recovery, &amp; long-term support. From cutting off the flow of illegal drugs to improving access to treatment- it’s time to break the stigma, care for our communities, and turn the tide of this epidemic. https://t.co/3tD5mijGHA
*****************************
The opioid epidemic has wreaked havoc across our nation and in my home state of Alaska—and it isn’t just impacting the lives of substance abusers. This is a problem that consumes all ages, all spectrums, and all classes. Addiction knows no boundaries. https://t.co/yZT5D6VgnB
*****************************
Last night the Senate passed the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 by a 99-1 vote. This bipartisan package was developed through combining the proposals of over 70 senators and work by five committees- truly landmark legislation. https://t.co/qzxAk9Jl2A
*****************************
The bill ends the practice of concealing prices from patients by prohibiting the use of “gag clauses,” which have banned pharmacists from telling patients when it's cheaper to buy a prescription drug without using their insurance.
*****************************
Tonight the Senate passed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, a bill I proudly cosponsored to increase transparency regarding prescription drug prices. https://t.co/pYLt0SLB3L

According to the International Energy Agency, imports to Europe are expected to rise almost 20 percent by 2040. With the abundance of our domestic natural gas supplies, the United States is poised to change that equation and provide our allies a greater level of energy security.
*****************************
I chaired an Energy Committee hearing on the economic &amp; geopolitical implications of a stronger U.S.–EU energy relationship. As we've often seen, Russia has used its much-needed natural gas resource as a geopolitical weapon, being the main supplier for reliant European nations. https://t.co/34uTFHFToS

*****************************
Our national security must always remain a top priority. Thanks to @SenDanSullivan for his work in helping to craft a bill that pushes the Defense Dept. toward a more robust Arctic strategy &amp; expanding military presence in Alaska to further strengthen our defense capabilities.
*****************************
This bill strongly supports the work of the Missile Defense Agency, includes a pay raise for our service members, bolsters our military’s cold weather capabilities, and sends a firm signal that Congress expects to see the construction of six new polar icebreakers.

In recent years, Alaska had been making good progress with China in developing a stronger, more balanced trade relationship, so the recently imposed seafood tariffs have understandably rattled our state.
*****************************
The seafood industry is Alaska’s number one private industry in terms of the jobs and the economic opportunity it brings. Approximately 40% of our salmon exports, 54% of our cod exports, and a significant portion of our shellfish were imported to China just last year.
*****************************
During a Commerce, Justice, Science Approps hearing, I asked Robert E.

There is simply no substitute for U.S. production, for as long as we need it, even as we seek to diversify away from oil. That’s why I believe it was the right move to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR to responsible development. #EnergySecurity is #NationalSecurity
*****************************
Global oil demand is rising, not falling. Our best course is to continue with our efforts to produce more oil here at home. As we produce more, we are creating #jobs, generating revenues, and bringing a degree of #stability and confidence to global markets.
*****************************
This year has been marked by greater volatility in global oil prices, which has shown up in the prices being paid at the pump by nearly every American family and business. Today I led an Energy hearing to receive testimony on why this is and what lies ahead. https://t.co/btBinxclNI
*****************************
I urge the President to take a broader view of the impacts his trade policy is having and recognize that trade assistance is no substitute for trade itself.

Congrats to Robert L. Wilkie on being confirmed as Secretary of Veterans Affairs with overwhelming bipartisan support. Because Alaska has more veterans per capita than any other state in the U.S., it is especially important that we have the right individual to lead the VA.

*****************************
We had no greater victory over the past yr than in our fight to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR. We recognize that Alaska needs to be able to develop the resources in the NPR-A, offshore &amp; Coastal Plain. We need the jobs, revenues &amp; security that new production will provide.

*****************************
Our geography, our climate, and our people have made Alaska a world leader on innovation. #AKNatLabDay https://t.co/S24eyBvdvQ
*****************************
Because Alaska has every type of renewable, from hydropower to wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass, dozens of those remote villages are adding renewables to their microgrids to help cut costs and emissions.
*****************************
In Alaska, about 200 of our rural villages are completely disconnected from a traditional grid and rely on expensive diesel generation that is barged in or flown in once or twice a year.

*****************************
Many of Alaska's rural areas are inaccessible by road, so one of the only options other than using small, remote incinerators is to use a helicopter to dispose of solid waste. If we are really focused on lowering our levels of emissions, using helicopters defeats the purpose.

Instead of seeing articles on efforts to return EPA to its core mission I'm reading about Pruitt's interactions w/ reps of industries he regulates, for example. Some are undoubtedly a result of the 'gotcha' age, but there are also legitimate questions that need to be answered.
*****************************
During an Interior Approps hearing on EPA budget, I told Pruitt I’m concerned these important policy efforts are being overshadowed because of a series of issues related to him and his management of the Agency.
*****************************
I’m pleased @EPA is reversing course on actions taken by previous admin that clearly stepped far beyond the bounds of what was intended when statutes were written: efforts to rewrite WOTUS, a common-sense approach to use of small, remote incinerators &amp; avoiding duplicate regs.
*****************************
@EPAScottPruitt has said that he is working to return the @EPA to its core mission of ensuring clean water, clean air, and clean land. He has also stated a desire to treat states as equal partners rather than as adversaries and has promoted a cooperative federalism approach.

The combination of developing more of our natural resources and stimulating America’s economy through tax cuts will create tremendous opportunities for our nation and put more dollars back into the pockets of hard-working Americans. #TaxReform #EnergyIsGood
*****************************
Senate passed my legislation which opens a small portion of the non-wilderness 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for responsible energy development. #EnergyIsGood https://t.co/0TPeldEGhW
*****************************
Senate passed #TaxReform that provides relief for hardworking Alaskans &amp; their families by doubling the standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit, &amp; reducing the tax brackets at every income level. https://t.co/g9So0dAdO3
*****************************
Tonight I cast my in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, comprehensive tax reform that aims to encourage the economic growth needed create jobs and generate wealth, while reducing taxes. #TaxReform https://t.co/0MlpVKc2fv

Today marks World AIDS Day – a day to honor and remember all of those who have lost their lives fighting this terrible disease. Over 1 million people die every year from AIDS related causes; I look forward to a day when that number is zero. #WorldAIDSDay https://t.co/3gyhf14dYB
*****************************
Bottom-line, this is a #taxform bill that works for Alaska &amp; this nation. It gets dollars in pockets &amp; relief to families. It restores competition in the global marketplace, certainty to job creators, and confidence that now is the time to invest in Alaska &amp; the rest of America.
*****************************
This legislation will allow us to refill TAPS, which currently is just one-quarter full. This in turn will boost our local economy and reduce our nation’s foreign oil dependence.  #TaxReform
*****************************
This tax bill authorizes responsible energy development in the 1002 Area, which covers land in the non-wilderness portion of ANWR in northeast Alaska.
*****************************
99% of Alaskan businesses are small businesses, taxed at the individual rate. This bill allows owners of pass-through small businesses to deduct up to 20% of their business income from their taxes.
*****************************
Lowering the corporate tax rate is a critical component of this tax legislation and will allow American businesses to compete against foreign competitors, and make the investments in American operations that will bring the jobs and economic growth that have eluded us for years.
*****************************
The hallmark of this tax proposal is encouraging the growth we need in our economy to create jobs—the jobs that feed families, that put kids through college, and allow folks to build up their savings to cope with the unexpected. #TaxReform
*****************************
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubles the standard deduction, resulting in a $12,000 deduction for single filers and $24,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.
*****************************
This tax bill doubles the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 per child, a significant form of assistance to the 22 million Americans who use the Child Tax Credit. #TaxReform
*****************************
Speaking now on the Senate floor about how The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a pro-economy, pro-growth, pro-jobs proposal that will reduce taxes and put dollars back in the pockets of hard-working Americans at every income level. https://t.co/Hjg0GcBOGJ

Alaskans have repeatedly proven that we can develop safely and responsibly. Alaskans #ProtectTheArctic #EnergyIsGood #1002Area https://t.co/OX6zmlDsDe
*****************************
We will balance the potential impacts of development, and that's why we have not avoided environmental reviews. We will not sacrifice wildlife for the sake of development. There is no question that development &amp; environmental protection can and do exist in Alaska.
*****************************
The size of development pads has decreased by nearly 80% since the 1970s. New technologies have expanded the subsurface reach of the newest rigs by 4,000% over the same period. Many exploration wells are now built using ice roads and ice pads—leaving no impact to the tundra.
*****************************
And while we can be confident in those benefits, we can be equally confident that none of this will come at the expense of our environment, because new technologies have left the footprint of development even smaller.
*****************************
Revenues are not the only benefit that will result from careful development in the non-wilderness 1002 Area. We will also create thousands of good jobs that support families and help put kids through college.
*****************************
The 1002 Area is separate from any wilderness. It is separate from the refuge itself. So when we talk about where the 1002 Area sits and how it sits as a function of ANWR, it’s important to keep that in mind.
*****************************
I keep going back to the map of ANWR to remind colleagues that the 1002 Area was specifically set aside under ANILCA for consideration for oil and gas exploration.
*****************************
CBO estimates that our legislation will raise more than $1 billion in federal revenues over the next 10 years.

There is not a lack of interest in the Arctic. If anything what we are seeing is a lack of interest in working w/ current DOI leadership.

It is absurd that Interior Dept. has created a regulatory environment where operators cannot have commercially viable exploration programs.

This is the latest in a destructive pattern of hostility toward energy production that began the 1st day this administration took office.

Alaska knows the value and importance of our military better than any other. I would urge @POTUS to reconsider his #NDAA veto threat.
*****************************
Today I was proud to vote for #NDAA, one of the most important pieces of legislation Congress considers every year: http://t.co/WzOPEL7JfE.

Troubling that a #governmentshutdown was even an option, causing great economic hardship to the 15,000 Alaskans employed by the fed. gov.

I’m pleased that my Senate colleagues and I have passed a 10-week continuing resolution to fund the government through December 11.
*****************************
Unreal. It took NASA 11 years and $2.6 billion to drill on #Mars. It took Shell 7 years and over $7 billion to drill in the #Chukchi Sea.
*****************************
I call on the admin. to work w/Alaskans to develop a legitimate plan, with our input, to ensure resources in our federal areas are produced.
*****************************
What we need–but still don't have–is a predictable/sensible regulatory system that encourages companies to make investments in AK's future.
*****************************
It's clear that the federal regulatory environment (uncertain and everchanging) was a significant factor in Shell’s decision.
*****************************
Disappointed by Shell’s decision to suspend drilling operations in the Chukchi just as I've been frustrated by the long path that led to it.

Impediments to voting in many AK rural communities due to distance/language must be addressed. My hope is this bill resolves these issues.

I just introduced legislation to amend ANCSA to allow Alexander Creek to be recognized as an Alaska Native Village. http://t.co/1tu0sRO9W1
*****************************
Because of these reasons, I choose no deal over a bad deal.
*****************************
I'm not convinced this deal makes America or our allies in the Middle East safer. Iran’s leaders chant "Death to America, Death to Israel.”
*****************************
It doesn't dismantle Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons &amp; doesn’t require Iran to come clean on its existing nuclear program.
*****************************
After hearing from Alaskans all over the state, reviewing documents, &amp; participating in briefings I announced I couldn't support this deal.
*****************************
After a busy month home in Alaska, I’m back in D.C. First item on the agenda for the Senate—debating and voting on the #IranNuclearDeal.

We must do what we can to ensure that when a young person is released from prison, they have the tools &amp; resources needed to succeed.
*****************************
I hear far too often of this revolving door---falling back into the same habits that led to their involvement w/criminal justice system.
*****************************
When I travel throughout AK, I constantly hear we must do more for our young ppl who are released from prison back into their communities.
*****************************
AK faces significant challenges related to crime &amp; justice. Recidivism rates are some of highest in US--especially for Alaska Native males.

Joint Chiefs of Staff nom. says Russia is #1 threat to US security. How does that fit w/decision to cut troops in AK? http://t.co/tAqNHVavfd

We will continue to challenge this decision and seek a more responsible outcome to defend our nation in this vital and volatile region.
*****************************
Every cabinet official and military commander I speak to acknowledges the need for a strong Arctic posture.
*****************************
It's staggering that the Obama admin. is making short-sighted decisions &amp; ignoring the emerging threat presented by Russia/China/ N. Korea.

It is devastating far beyond what it means to our state economy, but what it means to America’s defense.

Hey @McDonalds—how about **Denali Mac? http://t.co/tuVNAr52ZQ
*****************************
I urge the Senate to support that provision &amp; bill so that we can avoid devastating impacts on the Alaskan economy, and across the country.
*****************************
As a Senator for AK &amp; Chairman of Interior Approps, I included a provision in FY16 funding bill that prohibits EPA from implementing WOTUS.
*****************************
The bottom line is that the new WOTUS rule will have absurd results in Alaska, in particular, in addition to steep financial costs.
*****************************
There aren’t many places in AK more than 4000 feet away from some kind of water: rivers, lakes, wetlands. Even permafrost might be regulated
*****************************
I thank the EPW Committee for recently passing bipartisan legislation that I co-sponsored to require the agencies to develop a better rule.
*****************************
The costs we face when developing in Alaska are already steep enough. They will be magnified and worsened by the final WOTUS rule.
*****************************
Impacts the man who wants to build a cabin on the Chena Ridge, the small miner in the Goldstream Valley, the subdivision developer in N Pole
*****************************
Under WOTUS if you have a 500 acres of land, &amp; 10 sq ft are within 4000 ft of any jurisdictional water, the entire plot can now be regulated
*****************************
174 mil acres in AK are wetlands (the entire state of TX is 172 mil acres). 43% of AK is considered wetlands compared to 5% in the Lower 48
*****************************
WOTUS is far beyond a simple clarification-it increases EPA’s regulatory reach &amp; subjects new projects to impossible permitting requirements
*****************************
EPA *claims* WOTUS rule is a clarification to provide “certainty” and “predictability,* but in Alaska it does the opposite.
*****************************
Headed to the Senate Floor to talk about the harmful impacts of #WOTUS on Alaska. Tune in to watch here: http://t.co/X6hbpKylA9.

*****************************
Great to be surrounded by Alaskans as I received Congressional Leadership Award from Assoc. of Defense Communities! http://t.co/R02TU8s1VW
*****************************
This is why I voted to advance #TPA--it means so much to AK in terms of strengthening partnerships &amp; opening new markets for AK's exports.
*****************************
#TPA lets Congress lay out rules of engagement, set benchmarks for success, evaluate results, &amp; ultimately keeps free trade moving forward.
*****************************
Intl. trade supports 90,000 AK jobs, ~70% are part of our small/medium sized-businesses, from fishermen to natural resource developers.
*****************************
When Alaskans discuss economic partners, being separated from the Lower 48, more often than not we talk about exports with partners abroad.
*****************************
Many Alaskans have reached out to me about the Trade Promotion Authority that I just voted to advance, and I wanted to share my reasoning.
*****************************
I agree w/ SC Gov. Nikki Haley--the Confederate flag is part of the South's past, but it doesn't need to be part of its future. #TakeItDown

Off to the first Interior Appropriations markup in 6 years with my hardworking staff! https://t.co/hFMdNBCIX7
*****************************
Great to see all of you! https://t.co/YBF9CZ9JsU
*****************************
(2/2) This bill directs the Dept. of Interior to work with local stakeholders in AK to work towards these Arctic goals.
*****************************
(1/2) As Chair of @ArcticCouncil, US is in a position to meet Arctic objectives: security, natural resources, Native communities, research.
*****************************
Interior FY16 funding bill increases onshore &amp; offshore #energy development, prevents extras regs on #fracking, cuts extra fees on drilling.
*****************************
Accurate maps are necessary for navigation &amp; development in AK--this bill provides $1.3M for 3D mapping &amp; $3.2M for geologic mapping.
*****************************
Located on the Ring of Fire, AK relies on the @alaska_avo for safety. $1M is included for maintenance of volcano monitoring stations.
*****************************
(2/2) DOI is now required, after identifying contaminated Alaska Native lands in need of remediation, to expedite the clean-up process.
*****************************
(1/2) In 1998 Dept. of  Interior submitted a report to Congress acknowledging that it conveyed approx. 650 contaminated sites through ANCSA.
*****************************
Good news for Southeast--this bill requires timber sales in AK be economic &amp; the USFS use an appraisal system suited for AK's unique needs.
*****************************
Tribal courts in AK are vital for rural justice--this bill funds $10M for pilot programs to improve law enforcement/criminal justice process
*****************************
(2/2) This bill also separates the funds for CSCs from resources for other programs, to avoid CSC money being spent on other agencies.
*****************************
(1/2) Huge news--Alaska’s Native healthcare providers will have fully-funded contract support costs for the 2nd year in a row.
*****************************
The USFWS conducted a $71,000 hunt to kill 'invasive caribou' on Kagalaska--this bill prohibits funds for such costly hunts in the future.
*****************************
This bill ensures the EPA continues to operate the backhaul program in rural Alaska that removes solid waste/garbage out of communities.
*****************************
More than ever, AK knows the importance of wildfire-fighting capabilities. This bill fully funds national wildfire-fighting at &gt;$1 billion.
*****************************
(3/3) The FY16 Interior approps bill will prevent the EPA from using any funds to implement the overreaching, costly, harmful #WOTUS rule.
*****************************
(2/3) From fixing the Dalton Hwy to building homes in Fbks, projects in AK will face impossible permitting requirements because of #WOTUS.
*****************************
(1/3) The EPA's #WOTUS rule is a showstopper for any type of development in AK, and is the largest of the EPA's many land grabs.
*****************************
My position as Chairman means AK has a major hand in creating the budget for federal agencies (EPA, BLM, DOI, IHS) that impact our state.
*****************************

Caring for the environment is not inconsistent w/other goals of producing jobs in the Arctic &amp; addressing energy security needs. #CHOW2015
*****************************
We must also involve local communities--bringing together western science &amp; traditional knowledge is key to true stewardship.  #CHOW2015
