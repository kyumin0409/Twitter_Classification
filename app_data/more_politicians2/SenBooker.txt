A person who actively worked to disenfranchise and intimidate African American voters does not deserve to hold a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. The Senate must vote against Thomas Farr's confirmation tomorrow. #StopFarr https://t.co/w4tCdSHYls
*****************************
Mr. Farr hasn’t just spent his career trying to ration justice, but to tip its scales for political gain. That is not the kind of judge that belongs on any court in America. 

Mr. Farr is unqualified to serve as a federal judge &amp; I will be voting no on his nomination. #StopFarr
*****************************
It’s clear that if confirmed, Mr. Farr will pursue an agenda aimed at turning back the clock &amp; eroding the rights that generations of Americans have fought, sweat, bled &amp; died for. https://t.co/xW3fguVxEu
*****************************
Time &amp; again, Mr. Farr has been at the center of efforts to degrade the full citizenship rights of Black North Carolinians, of Black Americans, of all Americans. And time &amp; again in this process, Mr. Farr has offered misleading &amp; incomplete testimony regarding his work &amp; record.
*****************************
In 2016, a voter ID law that Mr. Farr not only helped to write, but later defended in court, was found to have targeted Blacks “with almost surgical precision.” https://t.co/VSl8ibeFdQ
*****************************
In 1990, Mr. Farr participated in a so-called “ballot security” meeting days before the Helms campaign infamously sent thousands of postcards targeting Black NC voters, suggesting they were ineligible to vote &amp; threatening criminal prosecution if they did. https://t.co/AkSeLflyQg
*****************************
In 1984, Mr. Farr managed the so-called ballot security program for the reelection campaign of Senator Jesse Helms that targeted and attempted to suppress the votes of Black North Carolinians. https://t.co/AkSeLflyQg
*****************************
The facts are clear: Mr. Farr has repeatedly worked to advance a very specific, very extreme, anti-democratic agenda—one aimed at turning back the clock, and eroding civil rights, workers’ rights and anti-discrimination protections.
*****************************
The outpouring of advocacy &amp; activism in opposition to Mr. Farr’s federal judicial nomination is not about politics. It’s not about partisanship. It’s not about about right or left—it’s about right &amp; wrong. #StopFarr https://t.co/rYJ8FNxgtO

First and foremost, we must listen to women—listen to their experiences, their concerns &amp; their solutions. We can also engage with our state &amp; local policy makers as so much can be done at these levels to improve maternal health. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/hqvxgs7ahv
*****************************
Specifically, my bill would extend postpartum coverage, increase access to primary care &amp; women’s health providers, facilitate expanded access to doula care &amp; more. I’m hopeful that Congress will take up &amp; pass the MOMMIES Act. #MaternalJustice
*****************************
I introduced the MOMMIES Act, which would improve maternal health by enhancing coverage for pregnant &amp; postpartum women covered by Medicaid. Because Medicaid covers ~half of all US births, this bill could have a significant impact on our maternity care system. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/mucpjL2Nyt
*****************************
We need solutions that address coverage, quality of care, pregnancy discrimination at work, toxic stress, racial bias in health care &amp; more. Because black women are most at risk for poor maternal health outcomes, they must be centered in solutions. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/fBQNVQz0NN
*****************************
Black women have a 70% higher rate of major birth problems &amp; are 3-4x more likely to die than white women—this is all the more concerning given that more than 60% of maternal deaths are preventable. This is a public health crisis &amp; we must address it immediately. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/fsCmQpGK4i

@MomsRising The maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is shamefully high. In addition to having the highest rate, the U.S. is the only industrialized country where the maternal mortality rate has increased over time—26% between 2000 &amp; 2014. #MaternalJustice

With months remaining in the current Congress, the only reasonable explanation for the rush is that Senate Republicans and the Trump White House are concerned about what will emerge if the appropriate documents are produced.

This is just the latest demonstration of the extent to which Senate Republicans have hijacked the normal process for vetting Supreme Court nominees and turned it into an opaque, partisan, wildly incomplete exercise that is an affront to the Senate’s constitutional duty.

What we already know about Kavanaugh is deeply troubling—which is why it’s even more critical that his full record come to light &amp; be debated in the Senate.
*****************************
President Trump is currently a subject of the special counsel investigation into Russia’s attack on our democracy—yet we’ve already uncovered that Kavanaugh is the only one from Trump’s #SCOTUS nominee list who’s openly stated that a president can't be under investigation.
*****************************
With so much at stake for the #SCOTUS nomination that we’re expected to vote on in just a few short months, Kavanaugh’s complete record must made available &amp; reviewed by senators—we cannot fulfill our constitutional duty to “advise and consent” without them.
*****************************
Bounds’s failure to get a vote in the Senate is a reminder of just how important it is for senators to review the complete records of judicial &amp; #SCOTUS nominees before voting.
*****************************
Bounds’s nomination failed because his despicable views on race relations, labor rights &amp; LGBTQ rights came to light as senators reviewed his record &amp; past writings.

All reasons to vote NO. https://t.co/jaeJqLBWvo
*****************************
There are many reasons why this #SCOTUS nominee shouldn't move forward—now we need to fight &amp; make our voices heard. Call Republican senators &amp; demand they reject this nomination: 202-224-3121. Remember: “The power of the people is always greater than the people in power.”
*****************************
We’re also in an critical election year &amp; according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s own rule that Supreme Court nominations should only proceed after elections, the Senate should wait to debate any nominee until after the American people have spoken in November.
*****************************
Kavanaugh has written extensively on his beliefs that a sitting president shouldn't be subject to criminal investigations or civil lawsuits—this all but assures he would work to shield Trump from any litigation or criminal proceeding related to the special counsel's investigation
*****************************
The Supreme Court could eventually end up issuing a decision on whether a sitting president can pardon himself or be criminally indicted—President Trump should not be able to nominate a justice to that court while his own investigation is ongoing.
*****************************
We can’t underscore enough the fact that @realDonaldTrump is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation &amp; there's a clear conflict of interest for this president—who has a history of demanding loyalty tests—to name a justice to the court that could be involved.
*****************************
I'm going to do everything I can to stop Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination—but there are also strong reasons why this president shouldn't be able to nominate, nor should the Senate even debate a nominee at this time.
*****************************
Kavanaugh has a long track record of working to undermine the @EPA &amp; laws that protect our environment from big polluters.
*****************************
In recent years, a narrowly divided Supreme Court has shown hostility toward labor unions &amp; the right of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions—Kavanaugh’s decisions have favored corporations over workers &amp; he will likely continue this troubling trend.
*****************************
Kavanaugh has shown a willingness to overturn common sense protections against gun violence, such as assault weapons bans &amp; other measures.
*****************************
Kavanaugh has worked to undermine the @CFPB’s power &amp; its efforts to protect consumers from predatory lenders &amp; bad corporate actors.
*****************************
Kavanaugh has a demonstrated hostility toward provisions of the Affordable Care Act—protections for those with pre-existing conditions, minimum standards for insurance, coverage for routine care like birth control &amp; breast cancer screenings are all on the line.
*****************************
President Trump has been crystal clear about his intent to only nominate justices that support overturning #RoevWade—there’s no question Kavanaugh meets this litmus test.
*****************************
We need to get money out of politics &amp; end the corrosive effect that dark money &amp; corporate donations continue to have on our democracy—but Kavanaugh's record suggests he will side with corporations and uphold our existing broken campaign finance laws.
*****************************
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we could see progress rolled back on many issues including the right of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, rights of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law &amp; more.
*****************************
Our next justice should be a champion for protecting &amp; advancing rights, not rolling them back—but Kavanaugh has a long history of demonstrating hostility toward defending the rights of everyday Americans.
*****************************
Right off the bat, this nomination couldn’t get any swampier—Kavanaugh is a partisan Republican, who worked for Kenneth Starr during the Clinton impeachment &amp; in the George W. Bush White House.
*****************************
The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is alarming &amp; I’m strongly opposed to his confirmation. #ScotusPick

The lack of pay transparency makes it harder for workers to negotiate for higher wages &amp; is a significant contributing factor in perpetuating gender &amp; racial pay gaps. Workers should have access to more info about what their coworkers &amp; colleagues earn. https://t.co/kP4bNMT44c

President Trump can pause his Twitter habits long enough to deliver a prepared #SOTU speech on national TV – but he isn’t doing anything in reality to bring America together or improve the lives of everyday Americans.
*****************************
Tonight’s address offered plenty of rhetoric, but no tangible solutions or blueprints for any of the challenges we face as a country. #SOTU
*****************************
In reality, President Trump has demonstrated a remarkable ability to divide people and pit Americans against one another. #SOTU
*****************************
In order to lead the United States, you have to be able to unite people – and regardless of what he said tonight, this President clearly has no capacity or interest in doing that. #SOTU
*****************************
The President has a distorted view of the world and one that is wildly out of step with reality and facts. #SOTU

*****************************
More importantly I hope that Liz's presence at #SOTU will speak to every single Dreamer in America – that we see you, we hear you, we love you and that you matter. This battle is not over.
*****************************
I'm bringing Liz to #SOTU because I hope that her presence shows the President that Dreamers like Liz carry the flame of the American Dream forward. We must find a permanent path for them immediately.

Today marks 8 years since a devastating earthquake hit Haiti. May the great people of Haiti &amp; the larger Haitian-American community know – our hearts &amp; our love are w/ you. 

The dignity &amp; strength you've shown in the face of tragedy is something @POTUS should learn.
*****************************
Let me be clear. @RealDonaldTrump does not speak for America. 

We are a nation of immigrants and I am so proud of that. https://t.co/ZnB8ln9GkC
*****************************
Congress must do everything to protect #DREAMers NOW.

To not do so is to steal the spirit of the American Dream away from generations yet unborn. What a tragedy that would be. https://t.co/KPlpGOFFNu https://t.co/Yy2tko0dEg
*****************************
Stay tuned – I hope my service on the Senate Judiciary Committee will make you proud.
*****************************
And lastly I am very proud that my friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris will also be joining me. 

We will be the 2nd &amp; 3rd African-Americans to ever serve on the Judiciary Committee in its 200+ year history.
*****************************
We can not let this administration drag us backwards.
*****************************
But I’ve also been encouraged to see the growing bipartisan support for comprehensive criminal justice reform in America.
*****************************
I’ve visited prisons to talk with incarcerated individuals to hear their stories, their hopes. 

And I have seen first hand how the criminal justice system is biased against the poor, against the drug-addicted, and against people of color. https://t.co/lsDete7TdO
*****************************
And that’s why in the Senate I’ve introduced over 20 bills to help fix our broken criminal justice system, including my latest bill to end the War on Drugs –– the Marijuana Justice Act. https://t.co/rA6PRjX3If
*****************************
That’s why I worked with the ACLU and residents to increase transparency and seek reforms at the Newark Police Department.
*****************************
That’s why as Newark mayor I established the city’s first office of prisoner re-entry to help formerly incarcerated individuals re-integrate into their communities.
*****************************
That’s why one of my 1st jobs out of law school was a tenant lawyer with Urban Justice Center – fighting for the civil rights of the most vulnerable in our communities. https://t.co/KjKUFgfFP5
*****************************
But civil rights &amp; criminal justice reform matter to me. Greatly.
*****************************
During Sessions' confirmation hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee – I testified against him. Why? Because he has shown over and over again that civil rights &amp; criminal justice reform don't matter to him. https://t.co/W0MRmIfjeb
*****************************
In the words of Martin Luther King Jr. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” 

I hope to continue his march towards justice serving on the Judiciary Committee.
*****************************
As a new member of the Senate Judiciary Committee – I will make it my mission to stand up to Jeff Sessions &amp; President Trump. 

And I won't rest until there is liberty &amp; justice for all. Thread 👇🏽 https://t.co/lfopZFefcB

@GOP Just a reminder: this is all to give the richest Americans a HUGE tax cut 4/
*****************************
@GOP AGAIN: under this version of Trumpcare, millions will lose health coverage, health costs will go up &amp; quality of coverage will go down 3/
*****************************
@GOP In fact, this #HealthcareBill was deliberately crafted to protect &amp; increase the wealth of the few 2/

The Senate @GOP #HealthcareBill –drafted in secret w/ no public input– was NEVER intended to give better health care to more people 1/

*****************************
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump The truth will prevail.  14/14
*****************************
@POTUS The work of justice will continue. Those who’ve done wrong –be it Trump associates or @realDonaldTrump himself– must be held to account 13/
*****************************
@POTUS Comey’s testimony lays out a strong case that @POTUS has obstructed justice &amp; violated the trust of the American people. 12/
*****************************
@POTUS So do not let anyone minimize the importance of Comey’s testimony. It is profoundly consequential. 11/
*****************************
@POTUS Trump even said so himself, in an interview with Lester Holt 👇🏽 10/ https://t.co/8KfuY5ZqGv
*****************************
@POTUS Comey testified multiple times today that he believes Trump fired him to relieve pressure on the Russian investigation 👇🏽 9/ https://t.co/TzVsVvAPyM

@POTUS It’s also been reported Kushner is under FBI scrutiny re: Russia investigation &amp; that he pushed for Comey’s firing. 8/
*****************************
@POTUS Under oath, Sessions failed to divulge meeting with the Russian ambassador, which led to his recusal from the Russia investigation 7/
*****************************
@POTUS A reminder that it’s not just Flynn- other Trump associates are reported to have undisclosed communications w/ Russian officials. 6/
*****************************
@POTUS Now, Comey testified that he took Trump’s actions to be “direction” to the FBI Director to drop the investigation into Flynn 👇🏽 5/ https://t.co/omj0OgNRBB
*****************************
@POTUS We already knew Trump told then FBI Director James Comey: "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” 4/ https://t.co/F04ygjwt6P
*****************************
@POTUS In other words, a President trying to derail, influence, chill, direct a federal investigation … that’s obstruction of justice. 3/
*****************************
@POTUS Obstruction of justice does NOT require proof that justice was obstructed — only that a person endeavored to influence or impede justice 2/

*****************************
@USCBO Even the 40-year-old sees a 24% increase in premium cost. And that doesn’t factor in likely increase in out-of-pocket costs. 13/
*****************************
@USCBO That’s a 700 PERCENT increase in premium cost. That’s beyond unaffordable. 

It’s cruel. 12/
*****************************
@USCBO Remember! This 64yo person makes $26k/yr 

$13,600 is HALF OF THEIR ANNUAL INCOME. 

And "coverage" may not even cover basic services... 11/
*****************************
@USCBO Under Trumpcare? In states that let insurers lower standards, costs skyrocket for older adults. And this is for WORSE COVERAGE. 10/ https://t.co/1Yi13e606k
*****************************
@USCBO CBO gives concrete examples. Under ACA (current law), thx to tax credits controlling costs, net premiums paid are $1700. 9/ https://t.co/Jv93AbG4zk
*****************************
@USCBO Make NO mistake – costs for many millions of Americans would go way up – especially for older adults &amp; lower income folks. 8/
*****************************
@USCBO Under Trumpcare, states could let insurers charge you more – MUCH more – if you have a pre-existing condition or get sick...👇🏽 7/ https://t.co/iH1xtBy0rT
*****************************
@USCBO So what kind of benefits get dumped? Things like “maternity care, mental health and substance abuse benefits…” etc. 6/ https://t.co/uzENxVGF8w
*****************************
@USCBO Trumpcare also lets states lower insurance standards, meaning the coverage you get may not cover what you need 5/ https://t.co/WUaNCF9EKa
*****************************
@USCBO Medicaid covers kids, working families, ppl w/ disabilities &amp; many elderly in nursing homes. 14 MILLION would lose access under Trumpcare 4/
*****************************
@USCBO That means the # of uninsured Americans would surge to 51 MILLION by 2026, much higher than pre-ACA 3/
*****************************
@USCBO Right off the bat, we know that Trumpcare means 23 MILLION fewer Americans would have health coverage. 2/

*****************************
As a former mayor, I know how disastrous these policies would be for American cities, police officers &amp; public safety.
*****************************
No doubt our broken immigration system needs fixing, but forcing local police officers to act as ICE agents is NOT a viable solution.
*****************************
Demanding that cities repay federal funding used to hire officers or fight crime &amp; arguing this will make communities safer defies logic.
*****************************
It harms the ability of officers to build trust and cooperation with the communities they are sworn to protect.
*****************************
It distracts police officers from fighting serious crimes.
*****************************
Forcing local police to detain undocumented immigrants who are suspected nonviolent offenders wastes limited resources
*****************************
To Attorney General Jeff Sessions:
*****************************
But the way forward is most certainly not #Trumpcare. 
The way forward is to work together to strengthen the ACA.
*****************************
There is still work to do to ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care
*****************************
ACA has helped countless families w/ healthcare costs, expanded access to affordable coverage &amp; reduced # of uninsured to a historic low
*****************************
Today’s outcome is a testament to countless Americans who made their voices heard, and who took time to write, email, call &amp; go to an event
*****************************
Trumpcare would have left millions more uninsured, all while giving the wealthiest individuals and corporations a massive tax cut
*****************************
The failure of #Trumpcare is a victory for millions of Americans who don’t want to see their healthcare costs rise and their coverage worsen
*****************************
If the @GOP passes #Trumpcare, nearly 500,000 New Jerseyans would lose health insurance by 2020.

That is unacceptable. https://t.co/oqWUMgtm1q

*****************************
It would halt science research, making it harder for America to make advancements in finding the cure for cancer, Parkinson’s &amp; Alzheimer’s
*****************************
It would undermine the life-saving work done by diplomats representing American interests across the globe, making our nation less safe
*****************************
By gutting Meals on Wheels, the Council on Homelessness, Habitat for Humanity &amp; more, Trump’s budget jeopardizes health &amp; safety of the poor
*****************************
