*****************************
I encourage Congress to pass and the president to sign my bipartisan bill to impose sanctions on Hezbollah and Hamas, along with their enablers, for using human shields.
*****************************
Hezbollah has built these attack tunnels from inside homes, where they also use Lebanese civilians as human shields for their rockets and missiles, of which there are roughly 150,000 pointed at Israeli civilians.
*****************************
Israel has the absolute right and obligation to dismantle the terror infrastructure that Hezbollah has built in preparation for infiltrating its northern border and attacking its citizens, including the attack tunnels targeted this week by Operation Northern Shield.

*****************************
President Bush was the last of the Greatest Generation to sit in the Oval Office, but his resolve will not be lost to the past; it will triumph onward.
*****************************
Over his storied career, President Bush was a war hero and a businessman, a legislator and an ambassador. His time as Vice President prepared him well for the heavy burdens of that highest office, steering our nation through the fall of the Berlin Wall and the First Gulf War.
*****************************
Hearts are heavy as we bid farewell to President George H.W. Bush. He was a faithful servant to his country whose legacy of leadership &amp; love of homeland became a family tradition, earned him the admiration of  Americans &amp; secured him a special place in the memory of every Texan.

I'm encouraged by the progress we’ve seen over the past year but the road to recovery continues. I will continue working hard each and every day to ensure that TX communities still suffering from Hurricane Harvey receive the help they need. Together we can &amp; we will rebuild.
*****************************
I strongly urge my fellow Texans, if you are still in the process of rebuilding and recovering from the ravages of Harvey, to contact your tax advisor or for more information go to the IRS website at https://t.co/x9ul6oePww.
*****************************
But retirement account withdrawals must be made by December 31, 2018. That deadline is coming up. Texans impacted by Hurricane Harvey who are still rebuilding have until the end of this year to access your savings without a penalty.
*****************************
So, those hit by the disastrous hurricanes now have the ability to withdraw money from your 401k plans or any other retirement plans in order to rebuild from the storm without having to pay the ten percent penalty that typically applies.
*****************************
The Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio legislation passed with bipartisan support &amp; was signed into law by @POTUS. An important part of this bill eliminated the tax penalty for hurricane survivors who wanted to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay for the costs of repairs from storm damages.
*****************************
We also saw members of Congress unite to pass crucial legislation to respond to the hurricane, including a hurricane tax relief bill that I authored along with @JohnCornyn &amp; @marcorubio which provided significant tax relief for survivors of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria &amp; Irma.
*****************************

The NICA Act and President Trump’s recent executive order demonstrate the commitment of the entire United States government to ensuring that pressure works. --&gt; https://t.co/k5bGxhu6Bz
*****************************
The NICA Act ensures that international loans will no longer be doled out to keep the regime afloat, and signals to Ortega and his cronies that the U.S. will continue to increase pressure until they pursue meaningful democratic reform and human rights protections.
*****************************
Hundreds of Nicaraguans have been imprisoned or killed. Meanwhile the regime exploited international loans to advance their policies.
*****************************
I commend the Senate for passing the NICA Act. For years the Ortega regime has operated with almost total impunity as it systematically repressed Nicaraguans, targeted political opponents for torture &amp; murder, &amp; aligned w hostile governments like Venezuela, Cuba, Russia &amp; China.

Expanding the use of these grants will empower our community leaders and education officials with the resources they need to strengthen our schools, hire school safety officers, and keep our children safe. --&gt; https://t.co/tDZ0HqZgKT
*****************************
Much like the majority of Texans, I believe the number one thing that makes schools safer is having more armed police officers on campuses.
*****************************
Texas has not been exempt from the horror of school shootings. All of us have been horrified by the violent attacks on our students. These students, along with parents, local school boards, teachers, and communities across the country want a solution.
*****************************
Today @marcorubio and I introduced the School Security Enhancement Act, which allows local communities to utilize Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) grants for measures that reinforce school safety infrastructure and technology. --&gt; https://t.co/tDZ0HqZgKT
*****************************
This legislation recognizes the vital role state &amp; local entities serve in safeguarding America’s critical infrastructure &amp; protecting our nation from cybersecurity risks &amp; terrorist threats. --&gt; https://t.co/D6oVwtkD8p
*****************************
Streamlining this relationship allows for a more sustainable approach to cybersecurity.
*****************************
I commend the Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee for advancing @JohnCornyn &amp; my bill to solidify cooperation between the Department of Homeland Security &amp; the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium, which partners w universities including @UTSA &amp; @TAMU.
*****************************
Proud to work with my colleagues in this bipartisan effort and I am hopeful that additional public interest will bring revelation, justice, and closure where it has long been lacking. --&gt; https://t.co/VvEcjtrfrO
*****************************
Our bill attempts to address this by disclosing case records so that private detectives, historians, victims, and victims’ families may access these files, pursue leads, and document these tragic events.
*****************************
Unfortunately, many violent crimes committed against black families struggling for equality during this time were never solved.
*****************************
The bill would require the review, declassification, and release of government records related to unsolved criminal civil rights cases. The civil rights movement triumphed by securing for millions of people their rightful share in the American Dream.
*****************************
Glad to see the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported out @SenDougJones and my Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 today with strong bipartisan support. --&gt; https://t.co/VvEcjtrfrO
*****************************
Together, @JohnCornyn and I continue to urge the administration to secure the release of Austin Tice, a journalist &amp; former U.S. Marine from Houston, TX, who was captured in Syria six years ago. #FreeAustinTice https://t.co/5YaQA81a0E
*****************************
I look forward to the Senate swiftly passing this bill. #NicaAct #Nicaragua --&gt; https://t.co/hw4XyxldgE
*****************************
As Nicaraguans across the country take a stand against this brutal dictator, the US must use its leverage to stop the flow of international finance to the regime until democratic reforms occur, and those responsible for corruption and human rights violations are held accountable.
*****************************
#Nicaragua is facing the largest uprising since the civil war ended nearly 30 years ago. Daniel Ortega and his Marxist strongmen have systematically repressed the people of Nicaragua by dismantling the country’s electoral institutions and violently silencing the opposition.
*****************************
Today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to report bipartisan legislation, built in part on my #NicaAct, to hold President Daniel Ortega and his regime accountable for its human rights abuses and corruption in Nicaragua. --&gt; https://t.co/hw4XyxldgE
*****************************
I am hopeful the full Senate will move swiftly to advance this important legislation.
*****************************
By advancing this legislation, we are taking a stand against terrorist groups, including and especially Hamas and Hezbollah, who have built their military infrastructure and strategy around using human shields as cover for attacks on Israeli civilians.
*****************************
I commend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for moving forward with my bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by 44 senators, to hold terrorists accountable for using innocent civilians as human shields. --&gt; https://t.co/sqXsd6U6oc

Ted Cruz: Dems Delaying Kavanaugh Confirmation Because They Want to 'Re-Litigate' 2016 Election https://t.co/h1jkv7Fzgq

"We know that every Democratic member of @senjudiciary is going to vote no...Doesn’t depend on what they read in documents, doesn’t depend on what Kavanaugh says—they’ve announced ahead of time they’re voting no &amp; most of the Senate Dems have announced that in the full Senate." https://t.co/6Sqkw6Hq3S

I have long called for withdrawing from this dysfunctional deal &amp; targeting the regime w the sanctions surrendered by the Obama admin. The protests intensifying across Iran right now show us yet again that the Iranian people yearn to throw off the yoke of an oppressive regime.

The American Humanist Association convinced the Fourth Circuit to adopt a perverse interpretation of the Establishment Clause, which in no way prohibits a war memorial on public land from featuring religious imagery.
*****************************
Erected in the aftermath of World War I, the Peace Cross has stood as a testament to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.
*****************************
The Fourth Circuit agreed, failing to recognize the history and context of the memorial and misinterpreting the Constitution. For 90 years, the families of Prince George’s County have honored America’s fallen heroes.
*****************************
In the aftermath of World War I, residents in Prince George’s County erected a 40-foot Peace Cross to honor nearly 50 local men who lost their lives in the conflict. In 2014, the American Humanist Association brought a suit claiming the cross violated the Establishment Clause.

Tune in momentarily to my Facebook page to watch my LIVE remarks with #Texas @NFIB members, where I will be discussing my priorities for 2018. Watch here —&gt; https://t.co/XLV0LDBT14
*****************************
Read the text of the bill here --&gt; https://t.co/Y8tGOwZzIQ
*****************************
It also doubles the number of immigration judges and expedites the process by which we handle asylum claims by families who enter our country. I hope that my Democratic colleagues can join with us to stop the crisis that is occurring at the border. --&gt; https://t.co/1cjnlguxj6
*****************************
We can come together to fix this problem. The Protect Kids and Parents Act focuses on solving the current problem: it stops family separation, except in situations where it is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the child.
*****************************
Over the past few weeks, Americans have been rightly horrified by the images and videos coming from our southern border, where tearful children are being pulled away from their mothers and fathers. There is no doubt that this must stop, immediately. https://t.co/Oa0VCgE2y2

*****************************
With this passage, we take another step towards supporting our military, enhancing its readiness &amp; providing the capabilities our military needs. In today’s challenging threat environment, a strong military is vital to preserving our national security, prosperity &amp; way of life.
*****************************
Additionally, the Senate bill authorizes another well-deserved pay raise for America’s men and women in uniform. I am proud of the work we accomplished for our nation in this year's NDAA. #FY19NDAA
*****************************
The #FY19NDAA provides a clear framework for rebuilding and strengthening our military. In support of the National Defense Strategy, this legislation prioritizes the development of strategic capabilities while maintaining the strength of the force. --&gt; https://t.co/ONolzdcha2

Sen. Ted Cruz introduces 'emergency' bill to keep immigrant families together, slams Dems' proposal https://t.co/zcjPQeMm2z #FoxNews
*****************************
We can fix this. If my Democratic colleagues will join me, not play politics but work to solve the problem, we can start to end family separation this week. And, we can honor the rule of law.
*****************************
While cases are pending, families should stay together.Children belong w their families.Once their cases have been adjudicated–under my bill, in no longer than 14 days–those who meet the standard should be granted asylum &amp; those who don’t should be returned to their home country.
*****************************
The answer isn't what congressional Dems are proposing: releasing illegal aliens &amp; returning to the failed policy of ‘catch &amp; release.’ Rather, we must fix the backlog in immigration cases, remove legal barriers to swift processing &amp; resolve asylum cases on an expedited basis.
*****************************
I've visited detention facilities tragically housing children. For too long, they've been victims of our broken immigration system, detained under the Obama Administration &amp; through the present, facing horrific physical or sexual assault from human traffickers.
*****************************
All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop. Now. We can end this crisis by passing the legislation I am introducing this week. --&gt; https://t.co/D4W7e7qaw6

I am inspired by the incredible resiliency that our teachers and students displayed in the wake of Harvey’s destruction. Committed to our children’s education, Texas communities stood together and our students finished the school year strong.
*****************************
Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc along Texas' Gulf Coast, leaving many students, families &amp; teachers without a home, a place to work, or even a place to go to school. But Texans are not easily knocked down. As we all prepare for summer break &amp; I look back on the past school year.

*****************************
The Palestinians have encouraged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to launch a baseless and illegitimate investigation against Israel, which is unacceptable and underlines why Congress long ago prohibited the PLO office in Washington DC.
*****************************
They have also turned that hostility against the United States, condemning President Trump, Vice President Pence, Ambassador Haley, and other American officials who stood with Israel and against terrorism.
*****************************
The Palestinian leadership has shown relentless &amp; unrepentant hostility toward our close ally Israel. They have refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish State &amp; directly incentivized terrorism by providing hundreds of millions in salaries &amp; benefits to terrorists &amp; their families.

My prayers are with the Evans family in this trying time, and all those in the UK who seek a better way of life. Our British cousins deserve better. Alfie deserved better. #AlfieEvans #AlfiesArmy
*****************************
Alfie’s tragic situation, reflecting that of Charlie Gard last year, is becoming an all-too predictable consequence of socialized medicine, and the arrogance, imperiousness, and low regard for human life displayed by the bureaucrats who administer it.
*****************************
The NHS and UK courts refused to release Alfie to the custody of his parents, claiming that it was in Alfie’s best interests to die.
*****************************
Despite underestimating Alfie by more than a factor of a thousand, the NHS saw fit to play God. The NHS refused to permit Italy to treat him at no cost. The NHS refused to release Alfie to die at home. The NHS even expelled the priest ministering to Alfie.
*****************************
He lived for five days, despite his doctors’ ardent refusals to provide oxygen, food, or water to him.
*****************************
Before the NHS removed Alfie’s life support over his parents’ wishes—and the wishes of other nations, the Pope, and people around the world—his doctors estimated he would survive for three minutes.

I encourage all my fellow Americans to join me today in praying for Alfie and his family.
*****************************
I urge the UK gov to grant the Evans family’s request to treat their precious child in Italy. Americans strive to achieve the promise of “life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness” for all our citizens, no matter how young or old.
*****************************
National Health Service (NHS) doctors expected that he would pass away within minutes. Again, he fought back; at the time of this writing, he is continuing to breathe without assistance. But time is of the essence.
*****************************
It is a grim reminder that systems of socialized medicine like the NHS vest the state with power over human lives, transforming citizens into subjects.

Alfie’s life support was turned off two days ago.
*****************************
These events remind us of the tragic case of Charlie Gard last year.
It is a sad irony that while the people of the UK are busy celebrating a royal birth, its government is brushing off a commoner’s right to life.
*****************************
But UK and European courts have denied their right to seek alternate treatments for their son and instead have forcibly kept him in a hospital. Now they have turned off the ventilator and are waiting for him to die.
*****************************
Alfie’s parents, Kate James and Tom Evans, wish to seek experimental treatments for what is thought to be a mitochondrial condition. Italy has granted Alfie citizenship and offered to transport him to a Vatican hospital.
*****************************
Doctors initially thought that Alfie would not survive long, but he fought back time and time again, until a chest infection forced him to rely on a ventilator.
*****************************
Alfie Evans was born on May 9, 2016 in the United Kingdom. When he was only several months old, he was struck by a mysterious illness, and slipped into coma.

*****************************
.@POTUS should reject these empty promises and withdraw America from this disastrous deal.
*****************************
These proposed European ‘fixes' don't address the missiles Iran would actually build, the inspection problems that would actually arise, or the eventual sunsets as they would actually occur. They would only constrain the Iranians from doing things they never would have done.

Esta decisión no es una transición democrática de poder y ni siquiera es un cambio de guardia. Cuba es controlado por el Partido Comunista y Raúl seguirá siendo el líder. La presidencia solo es un puesto ceremonial otorgado por las elites.

The Castros saw to that; after many decades, their legacy is an institutionalized dictatorship that will survive beyond the Castro name. The freedom-loving people of Cuba want to live in liberty, not under their communist overlords.
*****************************
Cuba is controlled by the Communist Party and Raúl will remain its head. The presidency is a ceremonial post, underneath the Party's elites. By design, Cubans are not allowed to have free and fair elections.
*****************************
This move is not a democratic transition of power and it’s not even a changing of the guard.
*****************************
This week ends nearly 60 years of formal Castro rule in Cuba - but in name only. Raúl Castro will symbolically step aside and Cuba’s National Assembly will go through the motions of elevating his heir, First Vice President Miguel Díaz-Canel. https://t.co/P9f8lN5dzi

And at the end of her life, Barbara Bush had no cause for regret.
 
Indeed, she gave her family, the people of Texas, and all Americans a lifetime worth celebrating.
*****************************
‘At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend or a parent.’
*****************************
It was a symbol of her lifelong tapestry of love and service, stronger than executive orders, long hours, &amp; sleepless nights.
 
In her famous address for the 1990 Commencement at Wellesley College, she reminded graduates to treasure their human connections above worldly concerns:
*****************************
From China to Texas to DC, Barbara Bush worked on a beautiful floral needlepoint rug, stitching together changing times &amp; geography w constant love &amp; support for her family. Her masterpiece eventually graced the floors of the Executive Mansion, making the White House a true home.
*****************************
Standing beside him through Congress, the UN, the CIA, and 12 years at the White House, Mrs. Bush approached her public role with a class and grace seldom matched in our nation’s capital.
 
But it was her private role which she prized above all.
*****************************
She was as much a public servant as her husband and children: traveling the world as advisor and ambassador, campaigning for adult literacy programs at home, and, of course, making George Senior eat his broccoli.
*****************************
My prayers are with the Bush family at the passing of their beloved Barbara, an eternal First Lady in the heart of every Texan.

In the days ahead, I look forward to the President making the case to Congress and the American people that his proposed course of action in Syria is in the national security interests of this country.
*****************************
We should withdraw from President Obama's disastrous Iran deal that is enriching the Iran government with billions of dollars, and those ill-gotten gains are in turn being funneled to Syria to prop up the Bashar regime.
*****************************
It is now absolutely crucial that any further military action we take in Syria remains focused on protecting the vital national security interests of our country. In addition to any military action that we may choose to take, we must also take action against Assad’s financiers.
*****************************
Critically, that includes preventing those chemical weapons from falling into the hands of the radical Islamic terrorist elements in Syria.
*****************************
Tonight, the United States responded to the atrocities of Bashar al-Assad. As the President said, it is in our national interest to deter the use of chemical weapons. —&gt; https://t.co/LoSjjYRRel

ICYMI Wednesday, @POTUS signed into law the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which I proudly co-sponsored. The new law seeks justice for victims of sex trafficking &amp; ensures websites that knowingly facilitate this horrible crime are held liable. --&gt;https://t.co/uNRX7iaFhU
