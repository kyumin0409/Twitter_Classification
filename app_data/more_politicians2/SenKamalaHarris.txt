I asked Kavanaugh whether, like Dr. Ford, he had taken a polygraph, whether he would call for an FBI investigation into the allegations, and whether he watched Dr. Ford's testimony. None of his answers were "yes." https://t.co/jKsTFXx4jD

Republicans just announced a committee vote on Kavanaugh at 9:30 AM on Friday - less than 20 hours after Thursday’s hearing ends. This means little to no chance for the American people to contact them and weigh in. This is a sham.

I implore my colleagues in the United States Senate to listen to the next generation and take these allegations seriously. https://t.co/Efr7p75JyW
*****************************
Dr. Blasey Ford isn’t on trial. This hearing is to determine whether Kavanaugh is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. By hiring a private attorney to cross-examine Dr. Blasey Ford, Republicans are trying to intimidate her and avoid being held accountable by voters. https://t.co/kLBAhz9QMa
*****************************
The Senate must pass legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller TODAY. Republican leaders must allow it to be voted on. We can no longer afford to wait. This is a matter of preserving the rule of law.
*****************************
Dr. Blasey Ford is willing to testify. She wants to testify Thursday. Rejecting her reasonable terms, setting a 10 PM ultimatum to meet their demands and threatening a Monday vote is a blatant attempt to bully and intimidate.
*****************************
Dr. Blasey Ford said the earliest she could travel to D.C. &amp; testify was Thursday, but Republicans just announced they plan to move forward with a hearing on Wednesday. Why won’t they even accommodate her by 24 hours? This is a lifetime appointment. Don’t rush this.
*****************************
Dr. Blasey Ford had the courage to speak out—knowing that there are those who would try to shame, intimidate &amp; threaten her. It’s sad but not surprising that she’s been met with an utter lack of decency by elected leaders of this country. She - and all survivors – deserve better.
*****************************
The Republican proposal to shirk responsibility and avoid accountability by hiring private counsel to question Dr. Blasey Ford is shameful. And their attempt to deny us the right to question is wrong. Private attorneys do not represent the American people. We do.

Here is Kavanaugh's full answer. There's no question that he uncritically used the term "abortion-inducing drugs," which is a dog whistle term used by extreme anti-choice groups to describe birth control. https://t.co/PMbZzu8DqD
*****************************
When Kavanaugh was part of an investigation into a Democratic president, he was dogged in demanding answers. But he has since changed his tune, arguing that presidents should not be investigated. 

A position that I’m sure is not lost on the president who nominated him.
*****************************
Kavanaugh chooses his words very carefully, and this is a dog whistle for going after birth control. He was nominated for the purpose of taking away a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions. Make no mistake - this is about punishing women. https://t.co/zkBjXzIvQI
*****************************
Brett Kavanaugh coached Bush's judicial nominees to give the same kind of vague answers he gave us on Roe v. Wade this week. We have the receipts. https://t.co/gATpnkDyL0

A troubling takeaway from my questioning of Kavanaugh last night: he won’t commit to recuse himself from any of President Trump’s civil or criminal investigations should they reach the Supreme Court.
*****************************
This is how hard it is for a woman to access an abortion in Mississippi right now. That’s with Roe v. Wade in place. If Roe is overturned, women in Mississippi and three other states will not have access at all. It will be banned. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/2MTYm7rlpd

Judge Kavanaugh, I am concerned whether you would treat every American equally, or instead show allegiance to the political party and conservative agenda that shaped and built your career.
*****************************
Just last year, Judge Kavanaugh praised the dissent in Roe v. Wade and ruled against a scared, 17-year-old girl seeking to end her pregnancy.
*****************************
In reviewing this nominee’s background, I am deeply concerned that what guides him is not independence or impartiality—it’s not even ideology. What I believe guides him is partisanship.
*****************************
We should not be moving forward with this hearing. The American people deserve better than this.
*****************************
I would think that anyone nominated to the Supreme Court would want to have a hearing that is characterized by transparency and fairness and integrity and not shrouded by uncertainty, suspicion, concealment and doubt.

*****************************
Chairman Grassley is pushing forward with Brett Kavanaugh's hearing, despite last night's 11th hour document dump of 42,000 documents, stating that the Republican staff has had time to review them all. @SenWhitehouse rightly points out that would mean reading 7,000 pages an hour.
*****************************
“Mr. Chairman, I would like to be recognized to ask a question before we proceed. The committee received just last night - less than 15 hours ago - thousands of documents that we have not had a chance to read or review or analyze. We cannot possibly move forward.” https://t.co/IWSeM6AtNx
*****************************
The Senate Judiciary Committee just received 42,000 more pages of Kavanaugh’s documents last night, just hours before the hearing. NONE of which have been made public. It’s unacceptable.

The Senate Judiciary nomination hearing for Brett Kavanaugh began minutes ago. Senator Harris was the first to object to moving forward with the hearing. This has not been the transparent process the American people deserve.

*****************************
So much is at stake with this Supreme Court nomination. Kavanaugh is a threat to the ACA &amp; Roe. He thinks the President should be above the law. He's routinely sided with special interests &amp; big corporations against civil rights, workers’ rights &amp; environmental protections.
*****************************
Kavanaugh is a nominee who:
 
was hand-picked by the Federalist Society
passed a litmus test intent on ending a woman’s right to choose
thinks the President should be above the law.
 
We should fight against this nominee tooth and nail.
*****************************
Our country should not be in the business of deporting people to a country that tolerates “modern-day slavery.” https://t.co/zpNuU9gSBj

We have every reason to believe Kavanaugh will overturn Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh praised the dissent. He has ruled against reproductive rights. And, he passed a litmus test from the Federalist Society to get this nomination.
*****************************
Kavanaugh was nominated by a President who is an unindicted co-conspirator in federal crimes.
  
And he believes a sitting president should never be indicted.
*****************************
Retweet if you:

-Have a pre-existing condition
-Love someone with a pre-existing condition

The fight over Kavanaugh’s nomination is about your health and the health of those you love. If confirmed, he will be in a position to make it legal to deny you coverage.

Make background checks universal &amp; ensure data is getting into the system
Ban military-style assault weapons

*****************************
It’s not enough for Brett Kavanaugh to say that Roe v. Wade is "settled law.” SCOTUS can reverse settled law anytime it wants. We know why the President picked him. We know he met a litmus test and we know he has already attempted to deny a woman full reproductive health care. https://t.co/Bs152RfyT8

*****************************
The U.S. is 1 of just 13 countries where the rate of maternal mortality is worse than it was 25 years ago. For Black women, the risk of death from pregnancy-related causes is 3 to 4 times higher than for white women. We must address this public health crisis. https://t.co/B2v1mTomf8

A reminder on the anniversary of Sonia Sotomayor’s confirmation: Republicans demanded minutes from board meetings she attended in the 1980s be made public. They were. Now, they are trying to conceal records from 3 years Kavanaugh worked in the White House. What are they hiding?

On top of that, just yesterday, the National Archives announced they can’t review and produce Kavanaugh’s documents from the other 2 years he worked in the White House until the end of October.
*****************************
Republicans want to keep documents from 3 of the 5 years Kavanaugh worked in the White House hidden. Kavanaugh himself has said that those three years were “in many ways among the most instructive” to him as a judge. So how can they justify concealing these documents?

Historically, Democrats and Republicans have worked together to ensure that a Supreme Court nominee’s full record is produced prior to the nominee’s hearing and vote, but now Senate Republicans are refusing to produce Kavanaugh’s full record.
*****************************
PAY ATTENTION: Republicans are trying to ram Kavanaugh’s nomination through without full transparency or accountability.

Something we aren’t hearing enough about in the news: truckers in California won’t be able to rest as often if a provision added into the Federal Aviation Authority reauthorization becomes law. This is an assault on workers’ rights and the safety of everyone on the roads.
*****************************
A Trump Administration official called the ICE detention facilities where families are being held “summer camps.” That’s insulting. I’ve seen these facilities. They are prisons.

“There is never time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment; the time is always now.” Remembering James Baldwin, who was born on this day in 1924.

The American people have a right to see Kavanaugh's full record.
 
We need ALL the documents requested from the National Archives *plus* the documents Senate Republicans are still hiding, to be made public.
 
Until then, NO hearings or votes should be held.

Millions of Americans are evicted from their homes every year. Rent is just too high and wages are too low.

The Trump Administration has just announced that they will prioritize lining the pockets of big oil over protecting our right to breathe clean air, by rolling back our country’s fuel economy standards.
*****************************
The American family has legitimate issues and fissures that provoke potent reactions. But let’s be clear about what Russia did when they interfered in the 2016 election. They came into our house. They manipulated us. They provoked us. They tried to turn us against each other. https://t.co/jiCjIw0UhC
*****************************
At a Senate hearing yesterday, @SenBlumenthal asked Trump Administration officials to raise their hands if they thought the child separation policy was a success. Not one of them did. It’s indefensible. https://t.co/YOD3GgzaWO
*****************************
The Trump Administration’s policy of separating children and their parents will likely cause harm to these children for the rest of their lives. I'll repeat what I said weeks ago: those who created and implemented this policy, including Secretary Nielsen, should step down. https://t.co/hBD2b6sBgH
*****************************
429. According to Trump Administration officials, that’s the number of children in our government’s custody whose parents have been removed from the United States. At our Senate hearing today, officials wouldn’t commit to a deadline to reunify them. That is unacceptable.
*****************************
I’ve just introduced the Census Equality Act to include census questions on sexual orientation &amp; gender identity that were excluded by the Trump Administration. 

Why it matters: communities that aren't counted or are undercounted receive less federal resources &amp; representation.

Republicans demanded that minutes from board meetings Justice Sotomayor attended in the 1980s be made public &amp; they were. 

Now, they want to conceal records from 3 years Kavanaugh worked in the White House. What’s in those records that they don’t want the American people to see?
*****************************
Middle-class &amp; working families deserve better from us. If the Trump Administration is going to give corporations and the richest Americans a giant tax cut, I think we should be able to put a little money back into the pockets of renters struggling to keep a roof over their head.
*****************************
Just joined a group of parents and children protesting the Trump Administration’s failure to reunite all of the children they took away from their parents at the border.

Don’t let this go unnoticed: the Trump Administration just accidentally released documents showing they deliberately ignored the fact that shrinking National Monuments would hurt local tourism economies and put archeological and cultural sites at risk.

*****************************
The Census Bureau's own analysis shows that adding a citizenship question will cost more &amp; result in a less accurate count. Why does this Administration still want to add it? To protect gerrymandering.

*****************************
Kavanaugh's documents from his time working in the White House - including as Staff Secretary to President Bush - must be made public for vetting. He himself has said that his years as Staff Secretary were instructive to his views as a judge. What are they trying to hide?

Now we find out 463 parents have already been deported. Once they took the children and deported their parents, what was this Administration’s plan to reunite them? There clearly has never been a plan. https://t.co/Ta3TqQdr4J

One of the mothers I met with in the Otay Mesa Detention Facility has finally been reunited with her child. I just was heartbroken after speaking with her, and this news comes as a relief – but we can’t forget that hundreds more children still remain separated.

From his history of celebrating those who fought for an America that kept human beings enslaved, to his efforts to justify Trump’s ban on transgender troops, Robert Wilkie is a far cry from the best person we can find to put in charge of our veterans' care. We owe them better.

Kirstjen Nielsen was just asked about the deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville. She said: “it's not that one side was right and one side was wrong”

Yesterday, @SenJeffMerkley, @SenCortezMasto and I joined together to introduce the REUNITE Act – a bill that immediately reunites children and parents who were separated at the border, and establishes a permanent system to protect and reunify separated families. https://t.co/U927GSFs35
*****************************
The bill I introduced yesterday requires that children be immediately reunited with their parents, and it also includes a provision ensure the facilities where they are kept are subject to unannounced inspections by independent child welfare organizations.

There is no question: Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and the Intelligence Community believes that they will be back in 2018.

Yesterday, the President put "Russia First" and America second. Every American should be raising their voice.
*****************************
The whole world just watched as the President sided with Putin over U.S. Intelligence Agencies. There is no doubt that Putin has launched attacks on the very heart of our democracy, and by not standing up to him today, the President has invited him to do it again.
*****************************
It’s unconscionable for the President to meet one-on-one with Putin, especially given these latest indictments. We need to prevent the next attack, not reward the attackers.
*****************************
President Trump made clear that he had a litmus test for Supreme Court Justices—overturn Roe v. Wade. Brett Kavanaugh was selected because he passed that litmus test. Pay attention. A woman’s right to make her own decisions about her body and her future is at stake.

Secretary Nielsen made a request for asylum seekers to go to ports of entry to legally apply for asylum. Now, her department has implemented a policy that makes it nearly impossible for victims of domestic violence &amp; gang violence to do just that. It's cruel. https://t.co/QCmmv5Ewqi
*****************************
The Trump Administration is implementing a new policy that will result in potentially thousands of asylum seekers being turned away before they can plead their case at the border. Let’s be clear, this Administration is refusing entry to those who face certain violence and harm.

I'm on the steps of the Supreme Court to voice my opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Watch live. https://t.co/01iTHjKPJl

I know just how consequential this seat on the Supreme Court is. 

Had the Supreme Court not issued the unanimous opinion led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown v. Board, I likely would not have become a lawyer and I certainly would not have become a U.S. Senator.
*****************************
Whether or not the Supreme Court enforces the spirit of the words "Equal Justice Under Law," is determined by the individuals who sit on that Court. Brett Kavanaugh represents a fundamental threat to that promise of equality. I will oppose his nomination to the Supreme Court.
*****************************
All of Trump’s potential nominees to the Supreme Court vacancy want to take away a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions. Make no mistake - this is about punishing women.

This Supreme Court vacancy puts issues that affect every single American in the balance, from a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions to privacy, equality and civil rights.

This Executive Order doesn’t fix the crisis. Indefinitely detaining children with their families in camps is inhumane and will not make us safe.

DHS Sec. Nielsen's record of misleading statements - including yesterday’s denial that the Administration even had a policy of separating children at the border - are disqualifying. She should resign immediately.

It's time for Secretary Nielsen to resign. The government should be in the business of keeping families together, not tearing them apart. And the government should have a commitment to transparency and accountability. Under her tenure, DHS does not have a track record of either.
*****************************
They have also separated families at the ports of entry - and despite encouraging people to go to the ports to apply for asylum, they want to make it harder to apply for asylum.

This Administration has been talking about family separation as a deterrent since March of last year. Watch this. https://t.co/61HbFO4t1R

Today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he will overturn the rule that allowed Aminta, and other women who are survivors of domestic violence, from seeking refuge in America. We should all be ashamed. https://t.co/3c9bHclKxi
*****************************
Aminta had, in fact, called the police on her husband several times, but the officers told her they wouldn’t interfere in a marital relationship. So, she fled to the United States to save her life.
*****************************
Her husband beat her. He raped her. Once, he poured turpentine on her skin - he wanted to set her on fire. He threated to kill her if she called the police or if she left him.
*****************************
It was Christmas Day when Aminta Cifuentes crossed into the United States seeking asylum to save her life. Aminta, a Guatemalan citizen, was fleeing her abusive husband. She had endured 10 years of violence.
*****************************
The repeal of #NetNeutrality rules goes into effect today, but this fight is not over. House Democrats are trying to gather support to force a vote to save Net Neutrality just like we did in the Senate.
 
Take action &amp; demand your representative save the free &amp; fair internet.
*****************************
The government failed Puerto Rico at every level in the wake of Hurricane Maria – including in getting an accurate death toll. Today, I introduced a bill to establish federal procedures for counting fatalities after natural disasters. This can’t ever happen again.
*****************************
The spirit of the census is that no one should go uncounted and no one should be invisible. It is clear this administration knows adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census threatens its accuracy, and still plans to include it. https://t.co/5iFpSAJwf3
*****************************
I’ve already contacted Ben Carson to demand a justification for his proposal to raise rent on low-income households. Still waiting for him to answer why they think this will do anything at all to help low-income families. https://t.co/xLF1LAR066

We just introduced a bill to stop the Trump Administration’s immoral zero-tolerance policy of ripping immigrant children away from their parents.
 
Here’s what you can do: contact your representatives &amp; voice your outrage. Then, call the White House &amp; do the same: 202-456-1414.
*****************************
On this day in 1906, Teddy Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act to protect national treasures. This administration has been working to gut it. To raise awareness I’m asking everyone to share pictures of some of their favorite public lands. Here are some of mine. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/jyDc4eBT5W

*****************************
.@SenFeinstein &amp; I introduced a bill to prohibit the Trump Administration from indiscriminately separating immigrant children from their parents. Ripping kids from the arms of their parents is not border security. Our government should keep families together, not tear them apart.
*****************************
Not to be missed: the Senate confirmed Kenneth Marcus to lead the Department of Ed.’s Office for Civil Rights. He’s attacked programs that protect the civil rights of LGBTQ people, women, &amp; people of color. We’ll have to be viligant in resisting attacks on students’ civil rights.
*****************************
“A day has not gone by when the boy has failed to ask in Spanish, ‘When will I see my papa?’”

Quantum computing is the next technological frontier that will change the world. Without adequate research and coordination we risk falling behind in the cyberspace race. Today, I introduced a bill to create an entity to support the development of quantum information science.

From 1882 to 1968 there have been nearly 200 attempts to get Congress to pass federal anti-lynching legislation and all have failed. It’s about time we got a bill passed. I plan to introduce my own federal anti-lynching bill in the Senate.
*****************************
On this day in 1998, James Byrd Jr. was lynched – he was chained to the back of a truck by his ankles and dragged for miles down a paved road in East Texas. Lynching is a dark, despicable part of our history, and we must acknowledge that history, lest we repeat it.
*****************************
It’s clear we have to continue to fight for LGBTQ equality. This is a fight that every American who cares about equal rights and equal dignity must join. #PRIDE

Yesterday, I introduced the #EMPOWER Act, which will:
 
-Put companies on notice that they can't secretly financially protect harassers.
-Reduce the barriers preventing survivors from speaking out.
-Arm people with the resources to address systemic workplace harassment.
*****************************
If the #MeToo conversation ends without a meaningful change in our laws, then we will have failed not only the courageous women who have come forward, but also the next generation of women who will enter the workplace. Today, I introduced the #EMPOWER Act. https://t.co/230Xu0XAXv

In the face of falsehoods being spoken about the Mueller investigation, let’s speak the truth: in one year, this investigation has yielded the indictments of 19 people and 3 companies, and 5 guilty pleas. Congress should act now to protect the special counsel.
*****************************
When our laws allow sexual harassers to go unpunished &amp; silence survivors, we know we’ve got a problem to fix. Today I'm introducing the #EMPOWER Act with @LisaMurkowski because ending harassment in the workplace starts with challenging the institutions that allowed it to thrive.
*****************************
Remembering this wisdom from RFK: “There are people in every time and every land who want to stop history in its tracks. They fear the future, mistrust the present, and invoke the security of a comfortable past which, in fact, never existed.”

If we really want to help working Americans, then let’s take up causes that would actually put money into their hands, like raising the minimum wage, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, and guaranteeing access to health care for everyone.
*****************************
I demanded answers from DHS Secretary Nielsen about the Trump Administration's immoral policy of separating children from their parents at the border &amp; ports of entry last week. Her answers were beyond insufficient. https://t.co/2g2vo7EBJd
*****************************
72 countries effectively outlaw same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. Eight apply the death penalty as a punishment. The idea that this Administration is calling into question the eligibility of LGBTQ people to claim asylum is unconscionable.

We can’t let this fly under the radar: the Trump administration is systemically appointing extreme judges to the federal bench. Today, over my objections the Judiciary Committee advanced the nomination of Wendy Vitter, someone who refused to endorse the Brown v. Board decision.
*****************************
Public works professionals make vital contributions to our country. They make sure our communities have clean water, effective mass transit, and safe roads and bridges. I’m proud to introduce a resolution with @JimInhofe to designate this week National Public Works Week.

Today, we are grieving with Santa Fe High School, but we must do more. Making our schools safer for our children starts with passing the common-sense gun safety laws that the majority of Americans support. Another moment of silence will not suffice, we must act.

I voted NO on the nomination of Gina Haspel for CIA Director. Torture is immoral and the person we choose to lead the CIA should be able to state that unequivocally to the American people.

I voted NO on the nomination of Gina Haspel in the Senate Intelligence Committee today. The choice for CIA Director sends a clear signal about our values as a country. Senator McCain was right when he stated that her "refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying."
*****************************
The White House wants to pour billions of dollars into ICE’s detention facilities, places where we know human rights abuses are being perpetrated. Enough is enough. Today, I’m introducing the DONE Act with @RepJayapal to prohibit the expansion or construction of new facilities.

We are simply trying to do our due diligence to find and vet nominees. Jamming through extreme and unqualified nominees undermines the very nature of the judicial branch’s role in our government.
*****************************
But the whole point of the blue slip process is to protect the ability of the home-state Senators to look out for the interests of their constituents and ensure that the judicial nominees who are up for lifetime appointments in the courts of their states are qualified and vetted.
*****************************
Under this Republican Congress, this convention is being violated because the majority wants to confirm judges that they agree with ideologically and as quickly as possible.
*****************************
No Democratic Judiciary Committee Chairman has ever held a hearing for a nominee over the objections of a Republican home-state Senator.
*****************************
Both Senators from the state where the judge is up for the appointment need to signal their approval for things to move forward. This process has been in place for 100 years.
*****************************
Here’s what’s going on in the Senate Judiciary Committee right now: traditionally, judicial appointments are only considered once Senators from the state where the nominee will be appointed indicate their approval by turning in what we call a “blue slip.”

*****************************
Based on her full record, today’s hearing &amp; the lack of transparency in this process, I will vote no on Gina Haspel's nomination for CIA Director. It sends the wrong signal to the CIA workforce, the American people, and countries abroad about our values.

Lastly, this bill includes significant funding for states to fortify their election systems against attacks by foreign powers. While we urgently need to do more to improve our election defenses, this is a good step and the result of a bipartisan effort.

And, as a proud graduate of @HowardU I’m pleased @SenDougJones &amp; I were able to secure increased funding for HBCUs. They are critical to the foundation of our higher education system, and provide opportunities for some of the nation’s most promising &amp; deserving students.

However, today’s deal makes progress on issues I’ve fought hard for. Among them, it includes a long-term fix to ensure wildfires are funded like other disasters. This is a change @SenFeinstein and I have worked hard to make in the wake of the wildfires that devastated California.

Finally, we arrived at June 23, 2016, when the United States Supreme Court said that those Prop 8 proponents had no standing. And, on June 28, 2013, I was back at San Francisco City Hall where I had the honor of performing the marriage of Ms. Kris Perry and Ms. Sandy Stier.
*****************************
In August of that year, the Supreme Court voided those marriages. But here’s the important thing – we were not deterred. We banded together, we marched in the streets, we lifted our voices and we took our case to court.
*****************************
I was so thrilled to be a part of that moment. I walked up the steps of City Hall and I performed marriages that Valentine’s Day.
*****************************
There were people of every age, of every color – joyous with the idea and with the knowledge that they could actually be recognized under law for the love that they have for each other.
*****************************
I remember looking around at City Hall and everywhere you looked there were families that were just full of joy. You could feel the energy.
*****************************
Two days before, the Mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, had begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples for the first time.

The White House has made clear what side it’s on, by dismissing yet another bipartisan solution proposed by Senators this morning.
*****************************
This is not about transparency. This is an effort to weaponize classified information for political gain and expediency. This is the White House continuing its attacks on the American intelligence community. https://t.co/7AoF6eiEcv

It’s time we push back. Hard. https://t.co/wzqb5zAYYA
*****************************
Tonight, the Senate is voting on whether to impose a 20-week abortion ban. 

Women have the constitutional right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. It shouldn't be infringed upon.

Get out your bullhorns. Everyone should be shouting about this.
*****************************
The federal deadline to sign up for health insurance has passed, but California’s hasn’t. Californians - you have until this Wednesday, January 31, to visit https://t.co/KD55YchwBF &amp; get insured.
*****************************
Today, we remember the six million Jews and the millions of other victims of the Holocaust and reaffirm the solemn promise: never again. It is all of moral responsibility to stand firm against bigotry and hatred in all its forms.
*****************************
Let’s lay out the facts:
 
Trump threw 700,000 Dreamers' lives into crisis by arbitrarily ending DACA,
 
GOP leadership refused to allow a vote on a bipartisan bill giving them a path to citizenship,
 
&amp; now, they're using these young people as leverage.
 
It's downright immoral.
*****************************
.@CecileRichards is a true fighter. In the face of unprecedented attacks, she’s stood strong for women across America and always put the patients and doctors of @PPFA first. More women and men have access to reproductive health care because of her work.
*****************************
Robert Mueller must be allowed to do his job of leading this investigation. The American people are owed the truth. We must protect his independence and the rule of law.
*****************************
The immigration plan announced by the White House tonight is a complete nonstarter. Pitting young Dreamers against immigrant families runs counter to the values of our country.
*****************************
Thank you for fighting for California every day, @JerryBrownGov. I agree with you - we must continue to fight for our immigrant communities, protect our environment, and to work on the critical issues that impact Californians.
*****************************
It is not in the best interest of a civil society to make our local cops enforce federal immigration law, and divert their already strapped resources towards fulfilling a misguided campaign promise by President Trump.

I will keep working with my colleagues to find a long-term solution that supports members of our military, funds CHIP and community health centers, provides resources for those recovering from disasters &amp; guarantees a future for young immigrants who are as American as all of us.
*****************************
The Majority Leader’s comments fell far short of the ironclad guarantee I needed to support a stopgap spending bill. I refuse to put the lives of nearly 700,000 young people in the hands of someone who has repeatedly gone back on his word.
*****************************
We should do this immediately. https://t.co/xvuhrN5Wg3
*****************************
The House bill has been rejected with bipartisan opposition. Time for a deal that solves the issues the vast majority of Americans support - funding the government, reauthorizing CHIP &amp; protecting Dreamers.
*****************************
I am certain a bipartisan agreement can be made to fund the government and protect Dreamers. The only thing standing in the way is the chaos out of the White House and partisanship of Republican leaders in Congress.
*****************************
A quick reminder about why this chaos is happening. https://t.co/hLTqmmamoO
*****************************
Let’s be perfectly clear: we must find a bipartisan agreement to fund the government, protect Dreamers, fund CHIP and community health centers. The White House and Republicans need to come to the table.
*****************************
This fundamentally undermines the Department of Health and Human Services' mission to “enhance the health and well-being of Americans by providing for effective health and human services.” All Americans deserve health care, regardless of gender identity. https://t.co/Rm7UUyTE4A?

I voted NO on the reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I believe in empowering the Intelligence Community with the tools to keep our country safe, but this bill neglects to adequately protect the privacy rights of the American people.
*****************************
It’s a false choice to say we can’t fund the government, protect Dreamers, and reauthorize CHIP. We can and should do all three. What’s preventing us from a bipartisan agreement is the White House.
*****************************
The Senate Judiciary Committee is about to vote on more than 20 of Trump's judicial nominees - among them is Thomas Farr. He shouldn't receive a lifetime appointment. Throughout his career - over and over - he has worked to restrict the right to vote.

This fight is especially important now, in this moment when there are so-called leaders who are really sewing hate and division. And, I feel strongly that the spirit of Dr. King’s leadership and legacy is about remembering that we are all in it together.

*****************************
We have to call these actions what they are: an attempt to remake the demographics of our country by cracking down on immigrants.
*****************************
I’m disappointed, but not surprised, by this Administration’s decision. Since taking office, Trump has revoked TPS for nearly 250,000 people from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Sudan.
*****************************
The Trump Administration has made the inhumane choice and ended TPS status for about 200,000 Salvadorans, ignoring the violence and instability that continues to plague El Salvador,
*****************************
This hasn’t been a partisan issue – it’s been a humanitarian issue. Regardless of who was in office, Democrat or Republican, this form of humanitarian relief was extended. That changed this week.
*****************************
And, for nearly two decades now, Salvadorans with TPS have legally lived, worked and raised children - many of whom are citizens - in the United States.
*****************************
In 2001, President George W. Bush granted Temporary Protected Status to Salvadorans living here because it was the right thing to do. El Salvador was recovering from devastating earthquakes and these people couldn’t safely go back there.

*****************************
These are people who rebuilt their lives in the U.S. after fleeing an earthquake over a decade ago. They have kids, jobs, and homes here.

A vote for the Republican tax bill is a vote for:

-Tax cuts for corporations at the expense of middle-class families

-Increasing the deficit by $1 trillion
*****************************
As far as I’m concerned, we need to pass the DREAM Act before the end of the year. Not in January. Not February. Not March. Now. #DreamActNow

Here’s my suggestion: let’s slow down this process go back to the drawing board on this tax bill. Instead of giving corporations a big tax cut, let’s give the middle class a real tax cut. It’s that simple.

My Republican colleagues have cobbled their tax bill together behind closed doors, with no attempts at bipartisanship. Now, they are trying to rush this bill through today before Alabama Senator-elect Doug Jones is sworn into office.

If you worry about burdening your children with debt, let’s be clear, the Republican tax bill would increase the deficit by more than $1 trillion.

Hundreds of thousands of young people in this country are living in utter fear. We can’t force them to wait any longer. We must pass the DREAM Act, now. #DreamActNow https://t.co/DC9Mx9wKqa

According to @amprog more than 12,600 Dreamers have lost DACA status since September. Another 122 lose status every day we that don’t act. We must pass the Dream Act, now.

Under the Republican tax plan, families can’t fully deduct their state and local taxes, but corporations can. Doesn’t strike me as a good deal for the middle class.

The tax plan approved tonight by my Republican colleagues is shameful. This is a victory for corporations and the top 1% of Americans, not teachers, not seniors, and certainly not the middle class.

Something that has been quietly slipped into the Republican tax plan: a provision that lets oil and gas companies drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This is an attack on pristine lands that belong to the American people.
*****************************
The Republican Senators who just voted against our amendment showed they’re willing to add an estimated $1 trillion to the deficit to rush through tax cuts for the top 1% and corporations.
*****************************
UPDATE: I introduced an amendment with @SenBillNelson to force the Republican tax bill to go back to committee and be re-written in a way that gives tax cuts to the middle class without adding to the federal deficit. Every single Republican Senator voted against it.
*****************************
UPDATE: We still haven’t seen the text of the tax bill Republicans are scrambling to rewrite in secret. I’d imagine some Republican Senators haven’t either. Our constituents didn’t send us here to govern this way.
*****************************
The Republicans had to delay votes on this tax bill until tomorrow. They're rewriting it right now and we don't even know what's in it. This is no way to govern. We need you to keep up the pressure &amp; keep up the calls.

Because Senate Republicans couldn’t repeal the Affordable Care Act, they’re trying to turn this tax bill into a health care bill by repealing the individual mandate and slashing Medicare. Make no mistake - this is a health care vote.

Americans deserve better than this budget. And I intend to fight hard against it. I’m coming ready with Amendments. (8/8)

I have a problem with that. We all should. (7/8)
*****************************
Just one example - it cuts Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by $1 trillion. (6/8)
*****************************
Instead, it reduces taxes for the top 1% and cuts investments that middle class and working families rely on. (5/8)
*****************************
The Republicans’ budget doesn’t prioritize any of those things. (4/8)
*****************************
How I see it is, the government has three core functions and responsibilities—public safety, public health, and public education. (3/8)
*****************************
The federal budget is supposed to be a clear indication of American priorities and values. (2/8)

It means that insurance companies can go back to denying emergency room visits, prenatal care &amp; mental health care.

It means that states can let insurance companies get out of providing basic health benefits.

If a nursing home accepts taxpayer dollars through Medicaid &amp; Medicare, it shouldn’t be able to use forced arbitration. Plain &amp; simple.

@SenGillibrand @SenSanders And yes, we can and should be doing more to address economic injustices that exist at the intersection of gender and race.
*****************************
We should pass @SenGillibrand’s national paid family leave bill &amp; @SenSanders’ College for All Act.

Repeal and delay is the worst idea we’ve seen from the GOP yet. More people will be uninsured under this plan than any of their others.

*****************************
This bill cuts $772 billion from Medicaid programs that, among other things, help seniors pay for nursing home care.
*****************************
The Republican health care bill will make premiums to go up an average of 20 percent next year and will cause coverage to be worse.
*****************************
22 million more Americans would be uninsured over the next decade including 15 million Americans next year under the bill.
*****************************
The Congressional Budget Office has just released their score on this terrible health care bill. Here’s what it told us:
*****************************
6.26.13 Prop 8 is dismissed
6.26.15 Marriage equality is the law of the land

Happy Anniversary to couples celebrating in the coming days.
*****************************
I’ll be tweeting this every day until this terrible bill is killed.
*****************************
The Republican health care bill would take away coverage for millions of Americans to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.
*****************************
Who the Republican health care plan hurts:

Americans with disabilities
Seniors
Millions of kids
 
Who it helps:

Millionaires
*****************************
My mantra for fighting for healthcare this week: be persistent, be passionate &amp; be persuasive.

Throwing millions of working people off their health insurance to give tax breaks to the top 1% is considered a victory to some.
*****************************
What “cutting Medicaid” really means: less resources for kids with disabilities in schools &amp; less support for many seniors in nursing homes.
*****************************
Regardless of party, we must vote down this "health care" bill and stand up for the people we represent and serve.

*****************************
I didn’t receive a sufficient yes or no answer to my question, but I will keep pushing for that answer.
*****************************
Yesterday, I pushed Rosenstein to commit in writing that Mueller has full independence - otherwise the same thing may well happen to Mueller
*****************************
Rosenstein now oversees the special investigation run by Mueller – which is something we should be concerned about.
*****************************
Key point: Comey told Rosenstein about his concerns about Trump meetings. Then, Rosenstein still wrote the memo justifying his firing.
*****************************
Comey said he documented his conversation with Trump because he was concerned Trump would lie about their meetings. This is stunning.

Unequivocally, the Russians interfered in our election and they will be back to interfere again.

This is the time to fight not a "War on Drugs" but a war on drug addiction.
*****************************
While I don’t believe in legalizing all drugs, we need to do the smart thing, the right thing, and finally decriminalize marijuana.
*****************************
...they’ve also got to care about drug-addicted young man in Chicago or East LA.
*****************************
We need to make this administration understand that if they care about the opioid crisis in rural America, as they say they do...
*****************************
We need to fund, not defund, the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
*****************************
We need to build on reforms, instead of reviving mandatory minimums and boosting bottom lines for private prisons.
*****************************
We need a national drug policy that finally treats substance abuse not as a crime to be punished, but as a disease to be treated.
*****************************
Drug addiction is color blind. It doesn’t see red or blue.
*****************************
Sessions advocated that prosecutors seek the harshest sentence available, including an increased use of mandatory minimums.
*****************************
Sessions has threatened that USDOJ may renew focus on marijuana use, even in states like California where it is now legal.
*****************************
As San Francisco DA and California Attorney General, I was proud to pioneer a different approach. We named it Smart on Crime.
*****************************
The fact is, the War on Drugs did not work.
*****************************
What got less attention...was a memo the Attorney General issued the following day, to federal prosecutors all across the country.
*****************************
And with everything going on, we must multitask...as we all know, our system of justice was shaken last Tuesday.
*****************************
It is far past time a special prosecutor be appointed to oversee the FBI’s investigation into Russia. Period.

Under the Republican bill, the only thing that gets healthier are the insurance companies’ bottom line.
*****************************
You might be wondering: Who exactly does the Republican bill help?

Millionaires
The top 0.1% 
Insurance companies
*****************************
Under #Trumpcare will monthly costs go down for low income and middle class families who are stretched horribly thin? No.
*****************************
Will the Republican bill provide “insurance for everybody,” as President Trump promised? No.
*****************************
So let’s ask some key questions and take a good look at what this #TrumpCare plan really would—and wouldn’t—do.
*****************************
Thanks to the #ACA, 55 million women have insurance that works—mammograms, check-ups, and birth control with no co-pay.
*****************************
Thanks to the #ACA, young people can stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26.
*****************************
Thanks to the ACA and Medicaid expansion 20 million more Americans have health insurance.
*****************************
There is a huge disconnect between the over-the-top criticism of the #ACA and the law’s actual impact.
*****************************
7 years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law @JoeBiden was absolutely right that it was a “big blanking deal.” https://t.co/wrddQdCzPv
*****************************
Before the ACA, 129 million people—almost 1 in 2 Americans—could be denied insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions.
*****************************
We should not forget, before the ACA, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance - that’s more people than the entire country of Canada

My message to families impacted by the #MuslimBan remains the same in the face of this new order: You are not alone. We stand with you.
*****************************
Recently, I met with families impacted by Trump’s first unlawful #MuslimBan and heard their stories.
*****************************
Refugees fleeing war and violence, who have cleared a two-year vetting process, should not arrive in the U.S. only to have the doors shut.
*****************************
The policy impact of the new #MuslimBan is the same as the last one: the same threat to our national security &amp; the same harm to our economy
*****************************
The White House had more than a month to develop their case, and has failed to provide actual justification based on the facts.
*****************************
Omitting one country from the list does not eliminate the need to provide the American people with meaningful evidence supporting this ban.
*****************************
The latest attempt by the Trump Admin. to ban new immigrants &amp; refugees from Muslim-majority countries undermines our nation’s core values.

Sessions lied under oath before Congress. Recusal isn’t enough. He must resign.

Weeks ago, I said Attorney General Sessions could not be an impartial steward of the FBI’s investigation. But recusal is no longer enough.

In sworn testimony, Sessions said he had not communicated with Russian officials. It is now clear that was a lie.

The President failed to provide assurances to the 5 million Californians who rely on the Affordable Care Act for their health insurance.
