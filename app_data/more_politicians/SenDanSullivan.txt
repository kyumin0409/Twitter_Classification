We’re mourning the loss of Sen. Bettye Davis. Throughout her decades-long career as a member of the Legislature &amp; the Anchorage School Board, she was a fierce champion for quality education &amp; equal rights. She’ll be missed. Our thoughts &amp; prayers are with her family &amp; friends.
We thank @AkGovBillWalker for his service &amp; welcome @DunleavyGov into office. In the near term we’ll work hand-in-glove to rebuild from the earthquake. We will also continue working closely w/state to grow our economy for a bright future for all Alaskans. Congrats Gov. Dunleavy!
Thanks to all my Senate colleagues &amp; numerous fed officials who reached out to ask how they could help AK following yesterday's massive earthquake. Lots of work ahead to rebuild, but as we've seen AKns are tough, resilient &amp; caring people. Stay safe out there! #ShakenButNotBroken https://t.co/J99PNV2thM

I applaud the nomination of retired General John Abizaid to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. I had the honor of serving as a staff officer to Gen. Abizaid when he was Commander of U.S. Central Command. I can’t think of anyone more knowledgeable and qualified than him.
Honored to have opportunity to lead this year’s Coast Guard Authorization, giving CG the resources &amp; training they need to complete the many diverse missions. Bill includes many great things for AK, Arctic and relieving unnecessary burdens on fishermen

I support the Trump admin's decision to reimpose sanctions lifted under the flawed 2015 nuclear deal. Under that deal, the Obama admin released tens of billions of dollars to the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism to carry out their regional and nuclear ambitions.

As stated, allegations of sexual assault need to be taken seriously. While SenateJudiciary &amp; its staff have been investigating allegations diligently, I respect&amp;support desire of my colleagues for additional info &amp; decision of the SenMajority &amp; POTUS for supp. FBI investigation.
I want AKns to know that while I was unable to watch the Senate Judiciary  hearing in real-time, I'm currently viewing it in its entirety. Out of respect for process, Professor Ford, &amp; Judge Kavanaugh, I will wait before offering further thoughts on this hearing.
Thank you for all the well wishes and kind words following my very unexpected appendectomy yesterday. I’m doing well and feel very fortunate to have my wife Julie by my side.
There have been a number of questions raised today regarding a protest in and directly outside of my Washington, D.C. office in opposition to Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Given the attention this has received, I believe it warrants a response.

https://t.co/3n6WY6dyjP https://t.co/RN0bPMMqtC
As I’ve stated over and over again, the federal government must do more in this critical area. Today we made important progress towards supporting those on the front lines and helping combat the scourge of drug abuse and addiction.
Last year, more than 72,000 Americans, including a number of Alaskans, died from drug overdoses  -- the highest rate ever.
Today, my colleagues and I in the Senate overwhelmingly passed milestone legislation to further combat the opioid crisis and help some of the most vulnerable in our communities.
Allegations of sexual assault should be taken seriously. Professor Ford &amp; Judge Kavanaugh deserve right to be heard on this matter. I commend Chairman Grassley on committing to as much &amp; will be following closely as these claims are evaluated &amp; reviewed. https://t.co/2z5NphTUpE
The length and the renewal are unprecedented and are the result of the hard work from the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission. Alaskans were represented so aptly by North Slope Borough Mayor, Harry Brower, and AEWC Vice-chair, Crawford Patkotak, in Brazil. Congrats to all involved!

Today we lost a true American hero. @SenJohnMcCain's life embodied steadfast patriotism &amp; sacrifice in the service of a cause greater than self. His courage &amp; indomitable spirit inspired millions in America &amp; across globe. Our prayers go out to his wife Cindy &amp; the McCain family.
Last Friday's Alaska Wellness Summit 2.0: #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave was extremely engaging, with lots of input and suggestions from Alaskans that my office and our federal partners will be taking back to DC. See our brief recap, here:
https://t.co/rg7E7A6tiV
One of the true honors of my life has been having @SenJohnMcCain as a friend &amp; mentor. He’s a true American hero. His courage &amp; indomitable spirit have inspired millions in America &amp; across the globe. I humbly ask all Americans to pray for him &amp; his loving family. Semper Fi John.
And thats a wrap! Thank you to @uaanchorage, all our panelists, and importantly, the countless Alaskans who took their time to be part of the solution. One of the biggest lessons today is that we all need to work together. We can beat back this crime wave. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave
.@Alaska_DHSS Dr. Butler at Wellness Summit 2.0: The secret sauce in this discussion: collaboration between govts &amp; non govt entities. It’s our problem. As Americans we don’t shoot our wounded. We have to treat this as a disease. We have to heal the wounds &amp; prevent the wounds.

3) To get ideas from members of the community on how to fight crime. (4) Have federal officials hear about how, despite our challenges, there are amazing examples of people all across AK working in their communities to try to keep us all safe. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave
So today we organized this summit with four goals in mind: (1)To bring federal, state and local officials together to coordinate efforts. (2) To paint a picture for the federal officials here about the unique challenges that we face here in Alaska in countering drug trafficking.
The vast majority of this is fueled by the drug epidemic. But here is the good news. We are Alaskans. We are tough, we are resilient and we innovative. There is no doubt in my mind that we can conquer this.
Its critical to remember that behind these statistics and numbers is a personal story of a fellow Alaskan and their family of heartbreak, tragedy, sorrow and anger. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave
In the last 5 years the murder rate in Alaska is up 79%. Rape is up 16%. Assault is up 36%. Robbery is up 52%. Vehicle theft is up 150%. Burglary is up 42%. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave
Nearly every day I hear from Alaskans about cars stolen and houses broken into. Shootings on our streets. Just days ago the Alaska Dept. of Safety put out their annual crime report. The numbers are staggering. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave
Today we are focused not only on our addiction epidemic, but on drug trafficking and the associated crime wave that is victimizing so many Alaskans.
We took the ideas from people in the audience and we put them to action. This summit, the Alaska Wellness Summit 2.0: Confronting Alaska’s Crime Wave, is a follow up to that. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave
Many of you here attended that summit and are still contributing significantly to the ongoing discussion. In D.C., we also continue to be very focused on this issue, passing numerous bills that will bring more resources for treatment and mental health services.
Federal officials from several different agencies attended to hear the many obstacles Alaskans face seeking recovery, as well as witness the indomitable spirit of Alaskans who have overcome those obstacles.
The turnout surprised all of us. Countless Alaskans showed to listen, gain inspiration, learn and exchange ideas.
2 yrs ago, I had the honor of convening the Alaska Wellness Summit: Conquering the Opioid Crisis, an important gathering of federal, state &amp; local community leaders dedicated to tackling the many challenges associated with the growing opioid epidemic. #ConfrontingAKCrimeWave

And while there is never a perfect solution, this legislation is built around an overwhelming belief that our veterans should be receiving the best care available to them.
As a nation, we owe our veterans and their families a great deal of gratitude and debt. This bill is a small step in the right direction to ensure our VA is responsive to their needs, accountable for their actions and prepared to fulfill this nation’s promises.
While many of these solutions we done administratively, it was imperative to solidify them into law.
This included efforts to pull scheduling back to Alaskans within the VA, allow for the continuation of very successful tribal sharing agreements; and ensuring community providers in Alaska are fairly compensated at rates reflecting the high cost of healthcare in our state.
Throughout this process, I worked to ensure this bill properly recognizes that AK’s VA system has &amp; continues to be unique. Building upon the lessons learned from the failed implementation of the VA Choice Act, we fought hard to protect the progress made in AK in recent years.
Today I proudly voted for the VA MISSION Act, which modernizes the way the VA approaches healthcare. It’s built on the idea – one that we continue to champion in Alaska – that no matter where our veterans live they have the right to prompt, quality care close to home.
Yesterday, I joined @theDaveStierenShow to offer a brief congressional update and discuss a variety of issues important to Alaskans.

Good news – the Right to Try Act, which passed the House yesterday, is headed to the President’s desk. This legislation gives patients with a terminal illness the right to pursue experimental drugs or equipment, even if the odds are long.

I join countless Alaskans in welcoming this announcement, which begins the necessary process of reversing an unlawful regulatory action by the National Park Service and restoring the unique management relationship between Alaska and the federal government

#NationalPoliceWeek is a somber reminder of the courage and tireless devotion our law enforcement, AK Troopers, and first responders display each and every day. We are forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. https://t.co/vaCjnb3bxS https://t.co/0GKCUCkG8Q
I commend the Trump Admin for implementing the bipartisan will of the Congress to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem — something that many other presidents committed to, but failed to follow through on. The future of U.S.-Israeli relationships is stronger and brighter than ever.
Today’s ceremony on the 70th anniversary of the founding of Israel demonstrates the unshakable bond between the United States and Israel — not just the bond between our governments, but more importantly, our people.
As to the White House official who offered such an insult, she should show some respect and apologize.
Making light of this – especially in the senseless and classless manner that’s been described in the media – is simply sad and speaks more broadly to the low levels of civil discourse &amp; respect that have infected our politics on both sides of the aisle. We all need to do better.
.@SenJohnMcCain is a great American, a close friend &amp; mentor of mine in the Senate. Like millions of Americans, my family &amp; I continue to pray for this American hero as he bravely battles cancer, &amp; is again showing the courage and fighting spirit for which he is widely regarded.
As the week comes to a close, I wanted to share a brief recap on the many activities and developments in Washington, D.C.

Moving forward, we must not only work with our NATO partners, but also our Arab and Israeli allies to develop a comprehensive and sustained strategy for advancing our immediate and long-term national security interests in Syria and the broader Middle East.
I commend these decisive actions and offer my prayers to the brave men and women conducting these operations this evening.
This response against Syria’s chemical weapons infrastructure was both measured and warranted, and a necessary step to deter future chemical weapons attacks, whether against innocent men, women and children or our troops deployed in the Middle East.
The precision military strikes launched this evening, in partnership with our British and French allies, send a clear and concise message to the Assad regime: the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.
This week we honor Bethel resident John Active, legendary Yup’ik storyteller and decades long voice of KYUK public media, as part of my “Alaskan of the Week” series.

@GarrettHaake Always love talking about my state and our remarkable people. Let's get something on the books.
5) So which are you, are you a tech company or are you the world’s largest publisher? Because I think that goes to a really important question on what form of regulation or government action, if any, we would take.
4) Do you think there's a risk given your influence that if we regulate we’re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?
3) When companies become big and powerful, and accumulate a lot of wealth and power, what typically happens from this body is there’s an instinct to either regulate or break up, right?…Do you have any thoughts on those two policy approaches?
2) Facebook – 2 billion users, over 200 million Americans, $40 billion in revenue. I believe you and Google have almost 75% of the digital advertising in the U.S. One of the key issues here, is Facebook too powerful?
1) Quite a story right – dorm room to the global behemoth that you guys are. Only in America, would you agree with that?

@POTUS @WhiteHouse Because every day we spend fighting the overwhelming govt bureaucracy needed to move forward on commonsense projects to fix our roads, bridges &amp; water systems is another day in which opportunities for economic growth are missed &amp; our nation’s crumbling infrastructure gets worse.
@POTUS I look forward to continuing to work with @WhiteHouse &amp; Senate colleagues on advancing an #Infrastructure plan this year.
I applaud @POTUS and his administration's continued focus and commitment on #Infrastructure  – which I believe presents our nation with significant bipartisan opportunities – especially as it relates to permitting reform and growing our economy.

@SenWhitehouse Once again, I encourage my colleagues in the House to move swiftly to take up and pass SOS, so that we can reauthorize @NOAA's vital Marine Debris  Program and enact other measures to clean up Alaska’s waters and protect our marine environment for generations to come. #SOSAct
That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation -- the Save Our Seas Act with @SenWhitehouse to address this global marine debris issue. The SOS Act passed unanimously in the Senate last year.
The #GreatGarbagePatch in the Pacific Ocean continues to increase dramatically. Alaska feels the brunt of this marine debris crisis with its extensive coastline. https://t.co/Yif3MDJurR

I’ve had the honor of knowing Lt. Gen. McMaster for many years, having served under him as a Marine Corps Major in 2009. I thank him, his wife Kathleen, and their three daughters for their outstanding service to our nation.
Lt. General H.R. McMaster has served his country for over 34 years with integrity, courage and with an exceptional warrior spirit. He exemplifies the best of what a military officer stands for.
The fact that human sex trafficking is problem in America, shocks most people. The fact that it’s a growing issue – by over 800% – is unbelievable. I’m proud to support bipartisan legislation to reduce this horrible scourge and hold bad actors accountable. https://t.co/k3c9hKa2sC https://t.co/peDio0twp3

President Reagan coined the term "trust, but verify." With North Korea, a regime that has a history of consistently cheating on and backing away from every deal they have ever agreed to over the last three decades, U.S. policy must now be "never trust and meticulously verify."

Yesterday, the Minority Leader had a choice. Sadly, he decided to turn a manufactured crisis into a government shutdown. https://t.co/2BDeNxYmwm
As work continues, I am hopeful that we can find a solution to reopen the government.  The American people, particularly our veterans &amp; troops, deserve better. My office stands ready to assist Alaskans, including those negatively impacted by this unnecessary government shutdown.
I simply fail to understand the logic behind the Minority Leader’s decision to shut down the govt. Passage of the CR tonight would have continued the essential functions of govt, provided funding for CHIP &amp; given Congress an opportunity to address a long term spending measure.
The bipartisan bill we considered tonight, which funded the government until February 16th, was voted down not for the items it contained, but for what was not included – a long term agreement on immigration for which we still have weeks to resolve.
Tonight, we saw a manufactured crisis officially turn into a government shutdown – something that was absolutely preventable.
The bill before us prevents a government shutdown, funds CHIP for six years and delays a number of harmful Obamacare taxes. While a resolution on immigration reform is important, funding the government must take priority.
While I believe a resolution on immigration reform – one that includes an increase in border security – should occur, keeping the government open and operational must take priority.
The short-term funding measure currently before us, which I support, contains numerous provisions that enjoy nearly universal backing in Alaska and Congress – including a six year extension of CHIP and delays to Obamacare’s Cadillac and Medical Device taxes.
Yet tonight, in the face of a government shutdown, the Senate Minority Leader is now emphasizing an issue he has rarely focused on – rebuilding our military – while failing to mention his primary reason for shutting down the govt – a lack of an agreement on immigration reform.
For months, Congress has worked to debate and negotiate a long term spending measure – one that appropriately supports our men and women in uniform, establishes policies that grow our economy, and tackles a series of leading national priorities.
The only thing worse than another Continuing Resolution – particularly for our military and veterans – is a government shutdown.

@SenJohnMcCain Opening #1002Area of #ANWR with most stringent enviro standards &amp; most advanced technology in the world will produce more American energy!
@SenJohnMccain &amp; I met w/senior Russian dissident &amp; asked: How can we counter Putin? Answer: Produce more American energy! #ANWR
Energy is used as a tool for good, productive diplomacy &amp; for troublesome power-grabs by our nation’s foes like Russia. #1002area #ANWR
Producing more energy in US will dramatically increase our country’s national security. #1002area #ANWR

Importantly, FY18 #NDAA also includes a well-deserved across-the-board 2.1% pay increase for U.S. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen &amp; Marines.
With up to 6 new icebreakers authorized, #NDAA improves U.S. #Arctic capabilities amid new commercial activity &amp; Russia's military build-up. https://t.co/lnosB68Vpz
In passing #NDAA, Senate also approved my amendment with single largest authorization of icebreakers ever, critical to #Arctic presence.
My #NDAA missile defense amendment includes increase of up to 28 ground-based interceptors (GBIs), incl. up to 20 at Ft. Greely #Alaska.
U.S. missile defense is vital as Kim Jong-un in 6 years has conducted more nuclear &amp; missile tests than his father &amp; grandfather combined. https://t.co/Um0J1BLoHx
FY18 #NDAA includes vast majority of my missile defense bill, and shows the Senate is serious about defending our homeland from #NorthKorea.
The Senate sent powerful message to our Armed Forces, allies &amp; adversaries that we intend to substantially increase military funding. #NDAA
At a time when global threats have grown in number &amp; severity, our defense budget has declined 24% over the past several years. #NDAA
The overwhelmingly bipartisan passage of FY18 #NDAA is a significant &amp; long overdue step toward rebuilding America’s military strength. https://t.co/Ui0khsFtne

1st responders racing into burning buildings, everyday Americans sacrificing their lives to protect neighbors &amp; prevent further mayhem...
Terrorists were gravely mistaken about our resolve. What emerged was a bravery &amp; compassion that for centuries has defined American spirit.
16 years ago on #September11, America was faced with attack of unspeakable evil &amp; cowardice that took lives of 1000s of our fellow citizens.
I commend the many Alaskans who've helped victims of #HurricaneHarvey, &amp; now support fellow citizens in danger along eastern Gulf Coast.
To help victims, @FEMA recommends donating to reputable recovery organizations where 100% of your resources go to relief efforts.

@kyledcheney I don’t know of a more capable, talented communications professional than Mike Dubke. He has a bright future wherever he goes.

I appreciate @SenBrianSchatz @SenTedCruz @SenGaryPeters @SenTomCotton @Sen_JoeManchin @MarcoRubio &amp; SenCapito for cosponsoring AAMD Act.
Spoke on Senate floor about the 
Advancing America’s Missile Defense Act, which would bolster this vital system. https://t.co/FShnW0GaM6
America’s missile defense is a critical insurance policy that protects our citizens and our allies from a nuclear catastrophe. #NorthKorea
We need to be able to say: Yes, we are safe, we saw this coming. And, yes, we have world’s most robust &amp; capable missile defense system.
When that day comes, Americans will ask us – Did we see this threat coming, and what have we done to protect our country? #NorthKorea
Top military leaders have been sounding alarm – it’s not a matter of “if” but “when” Kim Jong-un can range US w/ nuclear ICBM. #NorthKorea
In short time he’s been in power, Kim Jong-un has conducted twice as many missile tests as his father &amp; grandfather combined. #NorthKorea https://t.co/ZsZMLFZq51
@LeoShane @SecShulkin We’re moving bill to address backlog - my Express Appeals Act would expedite process, reduce bureaucracy so VA can better serve #veterans.

China has considerable influence over #NorthKorea, but has done little in recent years to slow or halt regime’s missile &amp; nuclear programs.
THAAD system is critical to protecting the Korean people, and is entirely the result of #NorthKorea’s continued aggressive behavior.
We urged @POTUS to call on President Xi to cease China’s economic retaliation against South Korea for the THAAD missile defense deployment.

The Obama #USFWS didnt issue rule b/c #Alaska fish&amp;game or habitats were threatened, but because it wanted control over management. #HJRes69
The Obama #USFWS Rule is not based on sound science, or established wildlife management principles, or federal law.  #HJRes69
In 2016 despite federal law, Obama #USFWS finalized rule restricting #Alaska wildlife management practices &amp; limiting public input. #HJRes69
Alaska's ability to manage our fish &amp; wildlife resources, granted at statehood, is stated explicitly in federal law. #HJRes69
Year after year, #Alaska Boards of Game &amp; Fish conduct a rigorous scientific process with public input to manage our resources. #HJRes69
In #Alaska, many hunt for survival, both personal &amp; cultural. We have the best managed fish and wildlife anywhere in the world. #HJRes69
Spoke today on #HJRes69 which rolls back an Obama-era rule subverting Alaska’s authority to manage fish &amp; wildlife.

The U.S. military should continue to fly, sail and operate in the #SouthChinaSea, and everywhere else international law allows.
$5.3 trillion of trade – $1.2 trillion of it from the U.S. – passes through the #SouthChinaSea each year.

The Affordable Care Act is not affordable for thousands of Alaskans. Doing nothing was not an option. #Obamacare #ACA
With skyrocketing premiums and  deductibles &amp; 1 provider left on exchange, #Alaska healthcare system is in downward spiral. #Obamacare #ACA
President Obama's promises have not proven to be true for millions across our country – and Alaska is ground zero. #Obamacare #ACA
In 09, Pres. Obama said, "If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.” #ObamaCare
Early this morning, the Senate took the first major step toward repealing the #ACA, keeping our promise to the American people. #ObamaCare

I also stressed to AG @ScottPruittOK importance of #EPA serving hardworking Alaskans &amp; Americans, rather than the coastal elites.
We discussed much-needed water &amp; wastewater infrastructure funding &amp; need to lift burdensome regulatory/mitigation requirements. #EPA
AG @ScottPruittOK has clear vision: return #EPA to role of reasonably implementing laws, protecting environment w/o stifling development.
As a member of @SenateCommerce Committee, I will work w/ incoming @CommerceGov Sec. Ross to ensure #Alaska remains superpower of seafood.
#Alaska is superpower of seafood thanks to science-based management &amp; hard-working Alaska fishermen.

Freedom of the Seas has been a core national interest of US since founding, &amp; a foundational principle of the post-WWII international order.
Regardless of attempts by Chinese leaders to militarize #SouthChinaSea, US should to fly, sail, &amp; operate there &amp; wherever int’l law allows.
Despite promises 2 halt cyber-attacks, theft of US intellect. property &amp; militarization of S. China Sea, China’s actions speak much louder.

The nomination of AG Pruitt sends a strong signal that the #EPA will be returned to its congressionally defined scope of authority.
AG Pruitt has stepped up time and again to defend his constituents when the federal government overreaches.
Americans want clean air &amp; clean water. But they don't want out-of-control agencies issuing endless regs more about control than environment
In @EPWMaj hearings, AG Pruitt impressed w/ his eloquent legal analysis &amp; incisive refutation of Pres. Obama's lawless EPA overreach.
I commend President-elect @realDonaldTrump on choosing Oklahoma AG Scott Pruitt to be our next #EPA Administrator. https://t.co/oSGGMIJ5MG

Saddened 2 learn of passing of legendary #Alaska painter Byron Birdsall. His unique perspective of the Last Frontier will always be with us.
The Rebuild America Now Act would prevent billions from being wasted in red tape/litigation, make it easier to overhaul U.S. infrastructure.
My bill will include a builder's &amp; worker's bill of rights, requiring timely permitting decisions, and transparency from federal agencies.
Rebuild America Now Act would limit sue-and-settle practices used by radical groups to abuse the judicial system, delay projects to death.
This simple one-in one-out rule on federal regulations has been successfully implemented in the UK and Canada. #RegulationNation
My bill would also cap regulations, requiring old regs to be eliminated for every new reg enacted by a federal agency (RED Tape Act).
Rebuild America Now Act would (2) create 1-stop shop for environmental reviews, ensuring projects don't get bogged down by endless agencies.
In new Congress, I will introduce the Rebuild America Now Act - (1) establishes time limits for approval/denial of permits for good cause.
President-elect @realDonaldTrump is set to reverse Obama Admin's abysmal permitting record. Members of Congress should join this effort.
Labor leader Terry O'Sullivan, with @LIUNA, called Pres. Obama's actions a “cynical manipulation of the approval process.” #RegulationNation
#KeystoneXL languished in permitting purgatory for two Obama terms before the President finally killed it in 2015. #RegulationNation
Obama Admin's capricious permitting was part of why @Shell halted its #Alaska operations, stranding resources and killing 1000s of jobs.
It took @Shell 7 years and $7 billion to get White House permission to drill a single exploration well off #Alaska coast. #RegulationNation
The problems of the U.S. regulatory state have grown for decades. #RegulationNation https://t.co/u7oCAEDSiv
Todd Hauptli of @aaaedelivers testified before @senatecommerce, "It took longer to build that runway than the Great Pyramids of Egypt."

It will have taken 14 yrs to permit Gross Reservoir expansion in Colorado; 20 yrs to permit Alaska's Kensington Mine.  #RegulationNation

#Alaska has promising future in responsible development. I am hopeful w/ incoming Admin. we will be able to reach our potential as a state.
Hopefully this is the final chapter in Admin’s harmful legacy of putting the interests of anti-energy activists above hard-working Alaskans.
We will work hard to reverse the latest damage the Obama Administration has done to our citizens, economy and future.
For nearly 8 years this Administration has given lip service to an "all of the above energy strategy," when their actions say the opposite.
In blocking #Alaska OCS lease sales, Obama Admin. is once again capitulating to extreme environmentalists. 
https://t.co/rgYoorqywl

I urge my colleagues on other side of the aisle to bring back longstanding tradition of bipartisan funding of our military. #FundOurTroops
Our enemies &amp; adversaries are the ones who truly gain leverage when we in Congress don’t commit to funding our troops. #FundOurTroops
Sen. Harry Reid has filibustered troop funding 4 times since I’ve joined Senate, more than any other legislation. It’s a disgrace.
At a time of so many tenuous hot-spots around the globe, why on earth would Senate Democrats filibuster troop funding?
…3) #NorthKorea tests submarine-based missile 4) Last Wed, @POTUS announces plans to leave 8400 troops in Afghanistan to combat Taliban.
… 1) #SecDef Carter announces US deploying 560 troops to fight ISIS 2) @POTUS announces 1K troops to Poland to strengthen NATO east flank…
Our nation &amp; our troops need this defense funding especially when, just in past week, major global security developments…
Sen. Harry Reid filibustered defense funding in the wee hours last Thursday, probably hoping no one would notice. https://t.co/IaVTHsov0r

Agree w/ #SecDef – we must fly, sail &amp; operate wherever international law allows, as we have done in western Pacific for more than century.
US will stand by our longstanding allies and should fully embrace new friends driven to our aid by China’s actions. #SouthChinaSea @CSIS
China’s aggressive actions are alienating itself from neighbors. #SecDef Carter said China risks erecting Great Wall of self-isolation.

POTUS: ruling takes us further from country we aspire 2be. I disagree. Our aspirations, from Founders, r 2 not b ruled by aristocratic fiat.
4 justices, who swore oath to support Constitution—which clearly states Congress writes laws—are willing to discard separation of powers.
It should alarm all Americans that 4 justices essentially concluded the executive branch can make and amend laws at will. #SCOTUS

If we’re serious about growing economy, then commonsense fixes, like relieving regulatory burdens, cannot keep failing on party-line votes.
During #ObamaEconomy, lowest labor partic. rate since 1978, more in poverty, paychecks have declined, Americans on foodstamps skyrocketed.
President #Clinton: “Millions of people look @ pretty picture of America @POTUS painted and they can’t find themselves in it.” #ObamaEconomy
.@TheAtlantic author: "In the 50s &amp; 60s, US growth democratized prosperity. In 2010s, we’ve managed to democratize financial insecurity.”

Economic future 4 our children is limitless if we have a federal government that is a partner in opportunity, not the obstacle it is today.
For decades, the American economy &amp; our workers have been the envy of the world. Not with #ObamaEconomy "new normal" of  &lt; 2% growth.
The % of Americans who own homes—a marker of the promise of the American Dream—is down 5.2 percent during #ObamaEconomy.
Family paychecks have declined and the # of people on food stamps has skyrocketed by 40 percent, all during the #ObamaEconomy.
During nearly 8 years of the #ObamaEconomy, # of Americans participating in the labor force is now at its lowest rate since 1978.
Honored 2 deliver Weekly #GOP Address on the lost decade of economic growth we've experienced in the #ObamaEconomy.
https://t.co/lDHsOiDAq0
Hopefully we can restore separation of powers, enshrined by Constitution, which #Obama Admin has persistently &amp; egregiously disregarded.
Judge Collyer's #Obamacare ruling is an overdue rebuke of President Obama’s habit of acting well beyond his constitutional authority.
Judge Collyer wrote Obama Admin’s defense was “a most curious &amp; convoluted argument whose mother was undoubtedly necessity.” #Obamacare
Court found Obama Admin. “violated Constitution” in sending billions in subsidies to health insurance companies, w/o the assent of Congress.

Americans deserve the truth about our stagnant economy. And they need less government burdens on job growth &amp; economic opportunity.
Obama administration will soon be 1st in history to propose 80,000 new pages of federal regulations in a single year. #regulationnation
Year after year, bureaucrats keep piling on more &amp; more regulations. It’s unsustainable, and a drag on our economy. https://t.co/XDt4oN8BCx

President Obama’s “new normal” of economic growth means our kids &amp; future generations won’t have same opportunities we had. #obamaeconomy
In the Obama years, Americans are seeing stagnant wages, poverty has grown &amp; more people are leaving the labor force.
.@POTUS claims by every economic measure we’re significantly better off than 7yrs ago. That’s simply not true:
https://t.co/OjnGswMhXl
The only comparison that should matter is how our current economic growth stacks up against historic American growth.
President Obama also says at least we’re growing better than Europe. Even that isn’t true anymore: Last quarter – US: 0.5%, Europe: 2.2%.
Obama admin. defends &lt;2% growth as the “new normal.” The American people should not be satisfied with that explanation. It’s a surrender.
America was made greatest nation in world with avg. historic growth of about 3.7%. Obama administration has failed to ever even reach 3%.
Stagnant economic growth of Obama administration is an outlier among Dem &amp; Repub administrations. https://t.co/FGbYXzzK1e
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is basically the health of the American economy – a measure of opportunity available to our citizens.
The troubling 0.5% growth last quarter went unaddressed by the Obama administration and most reporters, leaving Americans in the dark.
Congress and the President aren’t talking enough about the stagnant economic growth over last 10 yrs &amp; what it means 4 average American.

To stop the Obama Administration's effort, I introduced a simple bill: state terror sponsors should have no access to US dollars. #Iran
Yet now reports are Obama Administration poised to give Iran access to US dollars through offshore “clearing houses,” bypassing Congress.
President's nuclear deal did not mandate lifting US financial sanctions on #Iran, or giving regime access 2 most powerful currency in world.
Giving #Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, access to U.S. dollars is unacceptable. https://t.co/Y1wphMpiiu

Interior Alaskans: testify on US Fish&amp;Wildlife's rule restricting hunting on wildlife refuges tonight 5-8:30 @ Morris Thompson Visitor Ctr.
Alaskans sent me to DC to grow our economy, ensure next generation is not saddled w/ our debt. President’s budget does the opposite.
President also proposed increasing taxes on hard-working Americans by $3.4 trillion over next 10 yrs &amp; bringing nat. debt to $27.4 trillion.
President’s budget includes $10 tax on every barrel of oil, which would cripple #Alaska economy, reeling from low oil prices. Unacceptable.
I appreciate that @POTUS final budget reflects his visit 2 #Alaska. Investment in Alaska’s #Arctic is vital to US interests.
Coast Guard Auth. Act also lays groundwork for @USCG to grow #Arctic icebreaker fleet, which has lagged behind other nations for too long.
Coast Guard Auth Act transfers federal land @ Point Spencer to state &amp; AK Native hands, advancing prospect of 1st US Arctic deep-draft port.

Alaskans should have answers within 60 days — either details from Stevens investigation, or state authority to prosecute Bill Allen.
If deal was struck w/Bill Allen for testimony, shows DoJ saw prosecuting Sen. Stevens as higher priority than justice for abused children.
My amendment to Victims of Trafficking Act compels DoJ to grant state authority 2 prosecute Allen or give detailed reason why not in 60days.
For years, Alaskans have asked why DoJ never prosecuted Bill Allen for alleged sex crimes against children. DoJ has brushed off questions.
Today #Alaska AG Craig Richards sent US AG Loretta Lynch a letter requesting authority to prosecute Bill Allen. https://t.co/0HMcEZEIlH

Unfortunately my RED Tape amendment failed on partisan lines. Will continue to work w/colleagues 2 streamline regs, help grow our economy.
Cutting red tape is a bipartisan issue — President Obama mentioned it in his State of the Union address.
Most economists agree an over-regulated economy, one that kills jobs, is partially to blame. That’s why I introduced the RED Tape Act.
Deeply concerned by economy’s tepid growth of 0.7% in final quarter of 2015. Traditional post-recovery numbers are much more robust.

In the absence of American leadership, we can only expect to see more provocations from pariah states like #Iran and #NorthKorea.
#Iran gives every indication it will continue to be destabilizing, provocative force in MidEast &amp; world’s largest state sponsor of terror.
It is remarkable Obama Administration is still moving forward w/ billions in sanctions relief for #Iran in light of escalating provocation.
Sec. Kerry’s reaction mirrors apparent lack of outrage or urgency in freeing of 5 captive Americans, and other recent hostile acts by #Iran.
What about outrage? Humiliation at the hands of Iranians has become a sad hallmark of the Obama Administration. #Iran
Sec. Kerry expressed “gratitude” 2 #Iran after regime took 10 US sailors hostage, published photos of them on their knees. Disgraceful.
Great honor 2 meet King Abdullah II of Jordan, a crucial US ally, unflinching in fight against #ISIS. #JORoyalVisit https://t.co/OBLUPjCAXo
.@POTUS needs to go beyond rhetoric, be straight with American people, propose real plans 2 spur econ. growth, keep our nation safe. #SOTU
Amid the crises festering due 2 lack of American leadership, President plans to cut our military forces in #Alaska and elsewhere. #SOTU
Other parts of world not faring better: Russia provoking @ every turn; China illegally building islands in int’l shipping lanes. #SOTU
And we’re on cusp of giving billions 2 Iran, largest state sponsor of terror, sure to assist them in drive to Middle East hegemony. #SOTU
In light of Iranians taking 10 American sailors hostage, not surprising @POTUS avoided discussing “success” of #IranDeal. #SOTU
President gave only passing reference to seminal #IranDeal, consequences of which Americans will face for decades. #SOTU
Fed. gov’t stamps out creative fire, dictating boundaries of success. People, not bureaucracies, made America greatest country world. #SOTU
Opportunity is being stifled by a federal gov’t that believes it needs to regulate every aspect of business and American life. #SOTU
Final #SOTU demonstrates President still fervently believes growing gov’t at expense of freedom is proper way to structure society.
President spoke glowingly about our future. What about debt our kids and grandkids face: $10.6 trillion in 2009, $18.9 trillion today. #SOTU
Good news 4 small business &amp; our economy: House, including #Alaska @RepDonYoung, overwhelmingly passed bill overturning #EPA #WOTUS Rule.
#ISIS launched yet another attack in Turkey; huge swaths of Iraq and Syria in utter chaos; Libya and Yemen looking like failed states. #SOTU
Leadership in foreign affairs &amp; national defense is also lacking. As  a result, world is more dangerous than when @POTUS took office. #SOTU
Today, 15.7 million are unemployed; millions are working part-time in search of full-time work, or have stopped looking altogether. #SOTU
President has overseen one of slowest recoveries in history. GDP has struggled to grow a mere 2%, hurting middle class families. #SOTU
But on substance, I was disappointed President wasn’t straight with the American people about the serious challenges we face. #SOTU
Our resources, hard-working citizens, and freedoms truly make America the envy of the world. Appreciated @POTUS call to work together. #SOTU
In final #SOTU, President again demonstrated his considerable oratorical skill. Heartened he spent time highlighting the good about America.

Alaskans are currently debating state’s fiscal challenges. Federal gov’t should be doing the same. #Omnibus process demonstrates we aren’t.
We can’t keep exploding our debt by trillions of dollars without imperiling nation’s fiscal stability and our children’s future. #Omnibus
Way we fund federal gov — massive take-it-or-leave-it #omnibus bill crafted behind closed doors — is broken, not worthy of our constituents.
Good things for AK in #Omnibus, but could not in good conscience vote for $1.8 trillion 2,000 page spending bill with only 72 hours to read.

Since #IranDeal, increase in Iranian troops fighting in Syria. Gen. Dunford predicts roughly 2,000 troops there helping 2 save Assad regime.
Soleimani, responsible for killing Americans, negotiating arms trade with Putin—likely violating UN Security Council resolutions. #IranDeal
UN resolution prevents Quds Force General Soleimani from traveling. After #IranDeal? Soleimani is in Moscow meeting with Putin.
After #IranDeal, Iranians continue to fund Hezbollah, the regime's terrorist proxy, to the tune of $200 million a year.
Joining @hughhewitt @ 6:30pm (2:30 AK) re: #IranDeal &amp; Iran's continued support 4 terror, violation of law. Tune in  https://t.co/4yfLGhKJc6
Every action Iranians have taken since signing of #IranDeal has been to increase tension, undermine US security, destabilize Middle East.
.@POTUS: #IranDeal expressed “desire to build a new relationship with Iran.” As soon as ink was dry, Iran again chanting “Death to America.”
Americans’ #1 concern is terrorism. With #IranDeal, Senate Democrats voted to release billions to world's largest sponsor of terrorism.
Senate Dems made huge mistake allowing #IranDeal 2 go forward. 1st major national security agreement approved only by partisan minority.
Iran, soon to reap billions in #IranDeal sanctions relief, continues 2 support terrorism, threaten US security. https://t.co/ntZOY0vQZt

Americans were sold a false bill of goods. But we can't simply wait to see it self-destruct. #Obamacare
Premera, 1 of 2 insurers left in #Alaska offering individual coverage on #Obamacare exchange, said that it can't continue to sustain losses.
UnitedHealth, one of biggest insurers, announced may pull out of #Obamacare due to huge losses. If it happens, others likely to follow.
Extra costs on small business will trickle down 2 workers, likely in the form of reduced benefits and reduced wages. #Obamacare #CadillacTax
Cadillac Tax will hit estimated 90 percent of #Alaska businesses. Employer with 20 employees will pay estimated $28K more a year. #Obamacare
5yrs after #Obamacare, 1 in 3 Americans putting off medical treatment because of cost; among highest tally in 14yr. https://t.co/faYbDFwXHV
Due to #Obamacare prohibitive costs, many Americans have chosen to go without coverage &amp; pay annual fine. But fine is also very expensive.
In Anchorage, cheapest bronze plan increasing 46% in 1 year - among biggest hikes for metro area in U.S. #Obamacare https://t.co/oqMjrHCrwj
Of the 5 insurance companies that offered plans on #Alaska exchange only 2 remain. Both are increasing premiums by 40% this year. #Obamacare
Fmr Speaker Pelosi: #Obamacare will create “4 million jobs—400,000 almost immediately.” CBO: Bill will result in 2mill. fewer jobs by 2017.
Broken promise after broken promise: "If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.’’ #Obamacare
Constituent pleads: “Our new payment [is] just over $1K/month, doubling our monthly expense...What is a young family to do?” #Obamacare
Alaskans are being devastated by #Obamacare. We acted last night to stop this continuing disaster. Watch my remarks: https://t.co/YxpKejpQzs
Another: "Insurance rates are killing my small business…We have tried 2 keep employees covered…don’t see how we can continue to.” #Obamacare
Family in Eagle River Alaska told me they now have a $1,200/month premium with a $10k deductible under the “Affordable” Care Act. #Obamacare
#Obamacare is forcing small businesses to choose between covering long-time employees, or dropping them so the company can survive.
In #Fairbanks, small business owner had coverage for employees, now has to dump them into exchange to fend for themselves. #Obamacare
Hardly a day passes where I don’t hear from Alaskans facing #Obamacare crisis. Eg: Couple now paying $3K/month in premiums—nearly $38K/year.
Recently in AK, in just 2 hours I was told by AKns at 3 different places that #Obamacare is wiping out their home income, small business.
Glad to join 51 of my colleagues in passing a repeal of #Obamacare, marking 1st time a repeal bill will end up on the President's desk.

Senate is soon taking up the Federal Water Quality Protection Act (S. 1140), which I cosponsored, to force #EPA to withdraw #WOTUS Rule.
#Alaska is home to 60% of the nation’s jurisdictional waters. The stakes are as high for us as any other state. #WOTUS

Veto of #NDAA proves the only red line @POTUS is willing to enforce is one that hurts our military. https://t.co/aarFGdwykW
First time ever a President has vetoed #NDAA over issues having nothing to do with defense policies within the bill.
For only 4th time in past half century, President has vetoed #NDAA, critical funding for our troops to keep our country safe.
#NDAA sits on @POTUS desk. It is time to let the White House know you oppose the President’s veto of critical funding for our troops.
I don’t know how the Commander in Chief is going to explain #NDAA veto to our troops, their families, or the American people. #FundOurTroops
To govern is to choose. To govern is to prioritize. Is White House more focused on freeing funds for Iran than our brave service members?
Minority Leader Reid has called #NDAA vote a “waste of time.” Tell that to the soldiers, airmen &amp; sailors defending our country right now.
Among items on chopping block from a @POTUS #NDAA veto: troop pay bonuses and improved retirement benefits. #FundOurTroops
#IranDeal allows money to flow to terrorist groups. President’s #NDAA veto eliminates resources for our troops to fight terrorists.
Why is @POTUS providing billions in sanctions relief to the Iranian regime, yet balking at authorizing funds for our troops? #FundOurTroops
President Obama's #IranDeal and threat to veto #NDAA offers a striking dichotomy. Watch my speech on Senate floor: https://t.co/rcr9aW2w9S

Alaskans: we must start weighing every regulatory/policy decision as if our economic future depends on it. Because it does. #Shell #Arctic
Now more than ever, we need efficient, timely, certain regulatory regime 2 create jobs, develop energy, partner with private sector. #Shell
With #Shell's withdrawal, Obama Administration hit the trifecta: killing jobs, undermining energy security, &amp; degrading the environment.
Make no mistake: China and Russia will continue to develop #Arctic, but with little regard for environment. Not a win for the environment.
#Shell abandoned #Arctic drilling program due to high costs and “challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment.” #Alaska
#Shell spent 7yrs and $7bill. to drill single well in America’s #Arctic where hundreds of exploratory wells have been successfully drilled.
From the beginning, Obama admin. &amp; environmental allies put up unprecedented regulatory hurdles and delays. They succeeded. #Shell #Arctic

Senate Dems are making history, but not in a good way. 1st time such grave security matter moves forward w/ partisan minority blocking vote.
Senate Dems say vote on #IranDeal has already happened. That’s false. They need to stop avoiding the tough votes and be clear w/ Americans.
With respect to @POTUS, he will be gone in a year and a half; American people will live with security implications of #IranDeal for decades.
I cannot understand why my Democratic colleagues are supporting an #IranDeal so many Americans strongly oppose. To protect @POTUS legacy?
Iranian Parliament will need a majority to approve the #IranDeal; the world’s greatest democracy will not. https://t.co/TeJet4bVUo
Then another affront: @POTUS pursues United Nations vote on deal before even showing #IranDeal to the American people.
When #IranDeal negotiations began, @POTUS decided to go it alone. 98 Senators came together and said Congress has a role here.
Iran came to table because of sanctions instituted by Rs &amp; Ds working together; two different administrations &amp; Congress. #IranDeal
American foreign policy strongest when legis. &amp; exec. are aligned. Yet every step of #IranDeal, @POTUS has dismissed input of Amer. people.
Senators on both sides put in lots of time &amp; effort studying #IranDeal. Now Sen. Dems filibuster an up-or-down vote. https://t.co/TeJet4bVUo

Bipartisan majorities in Congress oppose #BadIranDeal because it makes world more dangerous, &amp; American people recognize that too. #IranDeal
If @POTUS is so proud of #BadIranDeal, he shouldn’t be directing Democrats to filibuster it. #IranDeal
Obama admin. has been dismissive of American people from beginning, not wanting them to weigh in thru elected representatives. #IranDeal
Iranian Parliament needs majority to pass #IranDeal. But thanks to Senate Dems, world’s greatest democracy will not. Another humiliation.
First time in U.S. history such grave and important matter to nat. security moves forward with partisan minority in both houses. #IranDeal
#IranDeal is what happens when a pariah state is steering the negotiations. This is how dangerous policy is made. https://t.co/LUS81e9gQ8
#BadIranDeal is result of echo chamber; when you want deal too badly and unwilling 2 walk away from table; when you ignore American people.
.@JohnKerry: Congress rejection of #BadIranDeal “will be the ultimate screwing” to Ayatollah who “constantly believed we are untrustworthy.”
When #BadIranDeal negotiations began, Iran was isolated. Now, our most important ally in Middle East, Israel, is considered pariah state.
Scope and # of concessions solidify sense that #BadIranDeal slowly, subtly cedes our power to what was until recently world’s pariah state.
#BadIranDeal gives Iranians, largest state sponsor of terrorism, billions of dollars upfront—that’s not concession; that’s surrender.
Following agreement, @POTUS says: “New relationship with Iran.” Iranians chant: “Death to America.” #BadIranDeal
When we agreed to lift Gen. Soleimani/Quds Force sanctions, as @JoniErnst said, that was a slap in face of our veterans. #BadIranDeal
Secret side deal unequivocally based on trusting Iran. Not a concession; it is a humiliation. And IAEA has never done this b4. #BadIranDeal
After @POTUS claims #BadIranDeal had nothing to do with trusting Iran, we’re told by Admin. Iranians will inspect themselves. Unbelievable.
Official described side deal: Iran conducts Parchin inspections alone. Every jaw in the room dropped. We couldn’t believe it. #BadIranDeal
In closed briefing Admin. official said she read but wasn’t allowed copy of inspections side deal. Just between IAEA and Iran. #BadIranDeal
Today we remember those we lost, &amp; give thanks for 1st responders who keep us safe and military members who defend our nation. #NeverForget
All negotiations require compromise. But at a certain point concessions become humiliations if too significant and frequent. #BadIranDeal
Americans overwhelmingly oppose #BadIranDeal by a 2-to-1 margin. More public knows about the deal, the more they dislike it.
Even supporters of #BadIranDeal are saying they have “serious concerns” calling it “seriously flawed” &amp; “falls short in many areas.”
Particularly visceral opposition of #BadIranDeal among Alaska’s veterans. #Alaska has highest number of vets per capita of any state.
During August work period in #Alaska attending town halls, roundtables all across state—not a single Alaskan said to support #BadIranDeal.
If Senate were to reimpose sanctions in event of Iran terrorist event, regime can cite P. 26 or P. 37 and legally walk from #BadIranDeal.
Administration says sanctions will “snap back” overnight. That’s a fallacy. Economic isolation of Iran took years. #BadIranDeal
.@JohnKerry said no grandfather clause in #BadIranDeal. P. 37 clearly says if sanctions reimposed, no retroactive effect on Iran contracts.
Agree w/ @SenDanCoats: agreement is filled with ambiguities/open to interpretation, including by Iranians. #BadIranDeal
Last year 83 senators signed letter to @POTUS detailing strategic goals of nuclear negotiations. #BadIranDeal achieved none of them.
I will be on Senate floor shortly to explain why I oppose the #BadIranDeal. Watch here: http://t.co/DstQyHZLQo
Bottom line: The #IranDeal does not dismantle regime’s nuclear weapons program. That was/should have remained the prerequisite of any deal.
Administration offers false choice: #IranDeal or war. Sanctions relief should only be granted for improved behavior, step by step.
98 senators supported bill allowing Congress to review #IranDeal. Hope my colleagues don’t filibuster historic matter, allow us to vote.
AP unveiled IAEA deal for Iran to collect own inspection samples. How can anyone vote for #IranDeal without details of secret side deals?
Quds Force Gen. Soleimani, responsible for killing/maiming 1000s of American soldiers, gets sanctions relief under #IranDeal. Reprehensible.
Khamenei: Israel gone within 25 years. @SenSchumer: If Iran intends 2 acquire nuclear weapon, must simply exercise patience under #IranDeal.
Sec. @JohnKerry: No #IranDeal is better than a bad deal. Releasing $100bil. to largest sponsor of terror w/no behavior change IS a bad deal.
So-called “snap back” of sanctions is a fantasy. Sanctions took years of intense effort to get countries and businesses to divest. #IranDeal

#Denali, the “Great One” comes home. http://t.co/8lzX117Exr
#Alaska is a symbol of the best in the American spirit, but also a real place with real people working to build a future. #ObamaAK
But in #Alaska, economic opportunity is stymied by federal efforts to lock up our resources. Creates hardship for our people. #ObamaAK
.@POTUS has said economic opp. ensures common good, gives power 2 powerless. This is as true in Alaska as anywhere else in country. #ObamaAK
Soul of state is in rural #Alaska, but villages lack sewer/water. Senate #DRIVEAct emphasizes infrastructure, needs @POTUS support. #ObamaAK
Sec. Jewell committed to me to help expedite permitting of #Alaska's hugely important gasline project. I hope @POTUS does too. #ObamaAK
Highways of #Arctic are icebreakers. Russia has 40, we have 2. We have an opportunity to be true leaders in this crucial region. #ObamaAK
.@POTUS' decision to cut Alaska’s Arctic-ready troops is strategic mistake. Hope he meets with our soldiers. #ObamaAK http://t.co/gKfF9kG6Qw
#Alaska is not a snow globe to be put on a shelf and shaken occasionally for a feel-good moment. #ObamaAK http://t.co/gKfF9kG6Qw
Framers of #Alaska Constitution: State is “homeland filled with opportunities for living… where ambitions will be bright and real.” #ObamaAK
For too long by too many Outside, #Alaska has been a battleground and playground, over-romanticized and under-appreciated. #ObamaAK
To make full use of opportunities, Alaskans can’t be seen as symbols or abstractions, but as individual with real hopes. #ObamaAK
Most Alaskans’ hopes and dreams transcend political ideology. We want to live in land teeming with opportunity available 2 us all. #ObamaAK
Pres. Reagan: #Alaska “is a treasure trove of resources vital to our economy and to the well-being of every American.” #ObamaAK

Agencies owe AKns detailed, statutory reasoning as to where they're getting their authority. "Whatever we feel like" is not a proper answer.
Sense of AKns is clear: facing the opposite of predictability and reliability from federal regulators. #regulation http://t.co/F3iZRBoWTg
Closer agency officials are to the people, the better the working relationship tends to be. Regs promulgated from DC are causing problems.
Regs have huge impacts on lives of individual AKns. Hearing from Deantha Crockett, representing small placer miners. http://t.co/9T9elzYXIz
Regulations must be based in the law or the Constitution - a principle many agencies are ignoring. That's federal overreach.
Every dollar spent on mitigation is a dollar that can't be spent building up Alaska (infrastructure, education, etc.)

We have obstruction from Senate Democrats and President’s threat to veto #NDAA. I’m not sure they’re reading what’s going on in the world.

Wishing a very special #18th birthday to my daughter Meghan! http://t.co/KZhvpaloRM
Mr. President, the people who sent us here still have big dreams and big hopes. Let’s help those dreams grow and their hopes flourish.
There is NO doubt of that.
Despite challenges, despite big-govt’s creep into our lives, despite armed EPA agents, we continue to live in greatest country in the world.
I believe our government should be helping, not hindering, these efforts.
And I think most of us can agree that we must unleash the country’s enormous economic potential once again.
We want a government that holds dear what our fathers knew – that all powers are derived from the consent of the governed.
We want to continue to live in the best country in the world, a country of unlimited opportunity, a country of Alaska-sized dreams.
We want our children to be safe and secure and we want the same for our neighbor.
We want to be strong here at home which will help us be respected once again by our allies and feared by our adversaries.
We all want the very best for the people we represent and the states we speak for.
let me close with a few words about how I view my mission here.
I suspect it doesn’t differ from what most of us here hope to accomplish.
And finally we must challenge the conventional wisdom that the federal government’s power &amp;  intrusiveness should always be expanding
Fourth: while I believe in a limited fed. govt, we must recognize where the fed. govt DOES have responsibilities -- like protecting our Vets
Third: we must get back to the rule of law.
Second, we need more, not less, access to our federal lands. As Americans, these are OUR lands – not the @Interior or @BLMNational
Let me suggest a few ideas: First – We MUST stop delaying economic projects that benefit our citizens.
We must work to once again unleash the great potential that is Alaska and America &amp; we must work to reinvigorate faith in the American dream
Congress has a job to do. We must work to address the anxiety and frustration of the people we serve.
What the American people are telling us, is that they want a federal government that helps ignite their hope, not smother it.
Our citizens are telling us that their government has gone well beyond deriving its powers from the consent of the governed.
And judging from what Americans are telling us, the reach of the federal government has exceeded its limits.
Since the founding of this country, we’ve had important debates right here on this floor about the role of the fed. government in our lives.
Yes, we have major challenges like all states. But in Alaska, we still have hope, we still dream big dreams. TAPS helps fuel these dreams.
I’m standing in support of what has defined this country for centuries: The idea of the American dream.
In supporting Keystone, I’m  standing for a larger principle. The ideal that the fed. govt should be a partner in progress. Not an obstacle.
Today I stand in support of Keystone. As an Alaskan I feel it’s important to talk about this bill &amp; the importance of energy infrastructure
