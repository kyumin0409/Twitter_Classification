It was an honor to meet with Raed. I am sad to learn of his death. More than 7 years into the civil war in Syria, good men and women continue to sacrifice their lives for a better future. Congress should recognize their sacrifice and pass the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. https://t.co/kewnhFxMbU
Happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/piSt9pTlkQ
Under the law, the president is now required to determine whether MbS is responsible and report to our committee with a determination and a decision on the imposition of sanctions. Read our letter: https://t.co/G9xFGyw4TH
“Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t” won’t cut it. So tonight, @SenatorMenendez and I sent a second Global Magnitsky letter to the president requiring that he specifically determine whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi.
Congress will consider all of the tools at our disposal to respond, including requiring by law a determination on the role of MbS.
I never thought I’d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/MQ4JsoQtqk
Everything points to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, MbS, ordering @washingtonpost journalist Jamal #Khashoggi's killing. The Trump administration should make a credible determination of responsibility before MbS executes the men who apparently carried out his orders.
I have a lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid. My full statement on the Global Magnitsky sanctions against Saudi officials for the murder of #JamalKhashoggi: https://t.co/EEM0HzGgwg

They can undergo their own investigation, but the U.S. administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi’s murder under the Global Magnitsky investigation as required by law.
The story the Saudis have told about Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water.
Sad to hear of the passing of Lacy Upchurch. A lifelong farmer, he understood the importance of Tennessee’s agriculture community and represented the @TNFarmBureau for a decade with dedication and commitment. My thoughts are with his wife, Kay, and his family.
In light of the circumstances, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin did the right thing in not going to the Saudi investment summit. https://t.co/mg1SRjapbJ

I know @nikkihaley will continue to be a strong voice for our country and wish her well in whatever comes next.
.@nikkihaley has been a fierce advocate for U.S. interests during her time as U.N. ambassador. While I hated to hear of her departure, I have enjoyed working with her and am thankful for her willingness to serve.
Today in Venezuela, Fernando Albán, a young opposition leader, died while in the government’s custody. This is disturbing and the government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened.
Our thoughts are with #JamalKhashoggi’s family and colleagues at the @washingtonpost. I have raised Jamal's disappearance personally with the Saudi ambassador, and while we await more information, know we will respond accordingly to any state that targets journalists abroad.

Transferring the countless injustices that have happened to women for decades onto a person who had nothing to do with them is an injustice, just as seeking to elevate one’s own political stature by wrongly destroying someone else’s reputation is an injustice.
The supplemental background investigation found absolutely zero corroboration of the allegations that have been made. I plan to vote for Judge Kavanaugh and believe he will be confirmed very soon.
Thanks to strong support from the administration, in both houses of Congress, and among businesses and nongovernmental organizations, this transformative effort is now on its way to the president’s desk.
The #BUILDAct will begin to move us away from providing direct assistance with mixed results and instead help countries become more self-reliant while saving taxpayers millions of dollars.
Glad that our bill with @ChrisCoons to promote economic growth in developing countries through U.S. business investment while saving taxpayers $20 million will now become law. Learn more about the #BUILDAct: https://t.co/3yLAdeNqWU.

The dam is finally breaking. Thankfully. 
 
As the president taxes Americans with tariffs, he pushes away our allies and further strengthens Putin.

We have legislation to do that. Let’s vote.
As I said yesterday, the Helsinki press conference was saddening and disappointing, and I am glad people on both sides of the aisle condemned it strongly.

Recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would undermine the rules-based international order that was created with U.S. leadership and has caused democracy to thrive around the world and made America a safer home for our citizens.
As we look forward to the upcoming Helsinki summit, the U.S. must stand firmly with our NATO allies and affirm our transatlantic partnership. Doing otherwise strengthens Putin and undermines democratic values.
As I travel throughout the Baltics this week in my role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it is clear that Russia’s destabilizing behavior continues to impact the region.

The president should reverse his decision to implement tariffs under the guise of national security. If he doesn’t, Congress must act and should start by passing our bipartisan legislation.
I believe pressure is building in Washington and across the country as American businesses and consumers begin to feel the effects of the administration’s misguided trade policy.
This week, I called on the administration to halt family separations, so I am glad the president reversed his position and signed an executive order. We will continue to work toward a long term solution.

Today, we introduced bipartisan legislation requiring the president to submit to Congress any proposal to adjust imports in the interest of national security under Section 232. Press release and bill text available here: https://t.co/v1vAYz1RrJ
If the president truly believes invoking Section 232 is necessary to protect the United States from a genuine threat, he should make the case to Congress and to the American people and do the hard work necessary to secure congressional approval.
Making claims regarding national security to justify what is inherently an economic question not only harms the very people we all want to help and impairs relations with our allies but also could invite our competitors to retaliate.
While we all agree on the need to ensure the international trade system is fair for American workers, companies and consumers, unfortunately, the administration is abusing the Section 232 authority delegated to the president by Congress.

Our legislation to replace the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs gives the administration the flexibility necessary to win this fight against terror abroad while strengthening the rightful and necessary role of Congress. My opening statement at today’s #AUMF hearing: https://t.co/0YNhotS2FZ

U.S. foreign aid programs should set the goal of putting themselves out of business. The BUILD Act promotes economic growth that will enable developing countries to stand on their own. Watch my opening statement at last week’s hearing: https://t.co/za5oKxZ1n8

This announcement is a prime example of how Tennessee’s business-friendly environment, combined with the pro-growth tax reform legislation I supported on the federal level, has our state firing on all cylinders. My statement on today's announcement: https://t.co/pTBI3dZXuB. https://t.co/RRC7lmgRis
I talked to Secretary Pompeo today, and as I said earlier, these new documents confirm what we have known all along: Iran’s claims that their nuclear program has only been peaceful are simply not true. https://t.co/Ul7Pgiz0tH

The #SFRC has favorably reported the nomination of Mike Pompeo to serve as Secretary of State to the full Senate for consideration.
At 5:00 p.m. ET, the #SFRC will hold a business meeting to consider the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State. Watch live: https://t.co/VezBspD1Ip.
I think all of us look at talks with North Korea with great caution and skepticism. It may lead to something. It may not. It’s important the meeting and the context for it is set up in the appropriate manner. https://t.co/UXQphswJ3Z
Our relations with Russia are at the lowest point since the Cuban missile crisis. We should be aware that miscalculations could lead us to a very bad place. And I think that’s why you see Secretary Mattis urging caution. https://t.co/IL3YQtwr1f
Under ordinary times, Mike Pompeo would be confirmed overwhelmingly. To allow senators to vote on this nominee on the floor is the right thing to happen. https://t.co/d1iuf8JLnB
Up next: @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos. Hope you'll tune in. https://t.co/o5YEKGi54I

We need to get Mike Pompeo confirmed. And people on both sides of the aisle should want someone like him making sure that the president has the right kind of input before he makes decisions. https://t.co/wLni78UXUN
I think all of us want to make sure that a meeting with North Korea is set up well. Our back channel has always been through the CIA, so Mike Pompeo was exactly the right person to begin the conversations. https://t.co/8eKXVJ8YlR
Enjoyed chatting with teachers and students of Friendship Christian School and Chattanooga Christian School this week during their spring break trip to Washington. @FCScommanders @ChargersCCS https://t.co/L2h7pAkoxP

We are much better as a nation having Mike Pompeo serve as Secretary of State than not having him as Secretary of State. https://t.co/a9E9VvkNxt
I can't imagine there’s a person in Washington that has more knowledge about the threats facing our nation, the people involved in those threats, and the people we can us to help us deal with those threats than the Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo. https://t.co/Vom3CMsseF
Mike Pompeo also knows how to build culture. He has done so at the CIA. He understands the importance of the professionals who have committed their lives, just like the foreign service officers at the State Department, to the CIA. https://t.co/RB820NBKcf
Mike Pompeo has served our nation so well. And having served in uniform, he understands that diplomatic efforts, if successful, are the thing that keeps our men and women in uniform out of harm’s way. https://t.co/O2HomihzBb
Mike Pompeo is a highly qualified nominee. We used to have a tradition here in the Senate of overwhelmingly confirming people to important positions. Unfortunately, we’re in an atmosphere now where that is just not the case. https://t.co/9LRCCffr8z
TOMORROW: Our free veterans event in Cookeville from 9:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. CT. Veterans, don’t miss a one-stop shop organized and ready to help you. https://t.co/dQUC12UwkI https://t.co/8q52mHPz14
I hope my colleagues will realize that we’re much better off as a nation having Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State and will vote 'aye' on the floor. My full remarks today on his nomination: https://t.co/UccNVXVGF4
Our nation is a better place today because of the example former First Lady Barbara Bush set as a wife, mother, and public servant, and we are thankful for the remarkable legacy she leaves behind. Our prayers are with the Bush family. My statement: https://t.co/DCE8mmXe7T.

.@POTUS just signed legislation I cosponsored to target online sex trafficking and bring websites that knowingly facilitate this horrific crime to justice. This builds on the progress we have made in the fight against modern slavery. My statement: https://t.co/l6tx70GjDP. #SESTA
My friend @SpeakerRyan is a man of great integrity and has served his district and our country well for many years. I appreciate his leadership and thank him for his service.
This administration, assisted by big spending Republicans and Democrats in Congress, is on track to be one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations in history. We must change course. https://t.co/YPPxzHUlwx

It was moving to be at Clayborn Temple yesterday with @MemphisRotary. In 1968, Memphis sanitation workers gathered there to fight for better conditions. They displayed a great deal of courage in the pursuit of equality, just as Dr. King did each day of his life. #MLK50 https://t.co/UJfSMZi1zf
Dr. King's vision not only strengthened America but also encouraged activism and sparked change. He is a constant reminder of what we can accomplish when we work together. My statement on #MLK50: https://t.co/9KHNyeSDpO.

Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. If we were serious about balancing the budget, we would do it. But instead of doing the real work, some will push this symbolic measure so they can feel good when they go home to face voters. https://t.co/MBGAA4AEmL
I applaud the president for ordering the expulsion of 60 Russian officials in solidarity with our allies and am pleased the administration has signaled that it is prepared to take more aggressive action when necessary. My full statement: https://t.co/1D4cjX91yc

Let me just say: down the road, the American people are going to be very unhappy with our lack of fiscal responsibility. And not only do I question the soul of my own party, I question the soul of the other party. #omnibus https://t.co/QfXEzdgqoy
Because of the #omnibus, which I did not support, young people's standard of living will be diminished because we passed a huge bill that is unpaid for. Our young people and their children are going to pay for it. https://t.co/g4LJdUsZaP
However, the #omnibus is a grotesque piece of legislation. We’re engaged right now in generational theft because we are transferring from young people, to us, their future resources because we don’t have the courage or the will to deal with these issues. https://t.co/h2b86PVxv6
While I could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our adult leadership here in Washington, I am optimistic about the future because of the young people around our country. They are so impressive. https://t.co/Bbyo0dbJgF
Now, let me speak to my Democratic friends. They raised unmitigated H-E-L-L over tax reform potentially creating some deficits if the growth projections didn’t occur. I have not heard a word from them about the fact that we’re adding $2 trillion in debt. Not a word. #omnibus https://t.co/LgMfKYEblD
For the Republican Party to have the presidency and Congress and be in a situation where we pass a bill that adds $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years has to be a wake-up call to people. #omnibus https://t.co/hObU7ZJkhc
We voted on a 2,232-page bill last night that is going to add – there’s no question – a minimum of $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years. #omnibus https://t.co/YZAVhfiNR2
Without extreme leadership at the very top, I do not think we will deal with this fiscal issue until there’s a crisis because I just don’t see the will in Washington to do the things that need to be done. https://t.co/OfrPRAdO0s
When I ran for the Senate, I ran concerned about our nation’s fiscal issues. And I ran on the combination of pro-growth tax reform and entitlement reform and dealing with the tremendous deficits that our country has. I really thought we would do something about it. #omnibus https://t.co/NLbXiIyhfo
I did not support the massive $1.4 trillion #omnibus spending bill. My full remarks on the Senate floor yesterday: https://t.co/Lp8s3UGvHm
Please do, Mr. President. I am just down the street and will bring you a pen. The spending levels without any offsets are grotesque, throwing all of our children under the bus. Totally irresponsible. https://t.co/np7BmP1AkB
General McMaster has served our nation incredibly well for 34 years, and I thank him for the work he has done in leading the National Security Council. It has been a privilege to work with him on some of the most pressing issues facing our country.

As the administration begins to work through the important details of such a meeting, we must continue to apply maximum pressure to the regime in Pyongyang. Skepticism and caution are critical as these discussions continue.
While U.S. policy toward North Korea has failed for decades, it is clear that a series of sanctions recently put in place by Congress and the administration are having a real impact.

Shutting down the government was inappropriate, but I am encouraged by the bipartisan discussions that have occurred over the past few days. I will continue working with my colleagues on a solution to the number of challenges still before us.
I very much appreciate the bipartisan efforts that are underway to resolve a number of the immigration challenges facing our country and hope that very soon we are able to reach agreement on a piece of legislation that the president will sign into law.
Dr. King’s courage and vision strengthened America, and his legacy serves as a constant reminder of what we can accomplish when we pursue public service in a way that lifts up each other and our country. #MLKDay
We have made significant progress over the past few months, and as I told the president when he called earlier today, we will continue working hard to achieve our shared goal: a better deal for America that will stand the test of time and actually prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.
At the president’s request, I have been working with his national security team and a number of my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a way to address the flaws in the agreement without violating U.S. commitments.
I think all Americans share the goal of stopping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Those who opposed implementation of the JCPOA, including myself and the president, opposed it because we believed it was a bad agreement. Before us now is an opportunity to do better.

Since it will be four years before the U.S. is officially out, @POTUS could work toward an agreement that could be ratified by the Senate.
If the Paris agreement were so important to the future of the world, why was President Obama so unwilling to have it ratified as a treaty?
No one should be surprised that one man deciding the fate of our country with the Paris climate agreement can easily be undone by one man.
Unlike France and Germany, President Obama purposely chose not to have the Paris agreement ratified by the Senate.
The left's anger about the Paris climate agreement should be directed at President Obama.

BREAKING: The #EndSlaveryAct is now law. Thank you for your support. Now the real work begins. Together, we can end it. #enditmovement ❌
The U.S. should absolutely veto the @UN Security Council resolution re: Israel. Anti-Israel bias only undermines peace efforts.
Our committee will carry out exactly the same procedures for Mr. Tillerson’s nomination that have been carried out for more than 10 years.
That has always been the plan, it is already in progress, and I am deeply disappointed my colleagues continue to imply otherwise.
Mr. Tillerson will submit an extensive financial disclosure and will go through same ethics and FBI checks as previous nominees.
By all accounts, Mr. Tillerson is currently ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee.
As is long-standing precedent for nominees, #SFRC has not asked Mr. Tillerson to provide copies of his tax returns. https://t.co/4FsOTQtdRa

We will use all the tools provided by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to quickly impose new sanctions for an Iranian breach. #IranDeal
The SFRC is involved in vigorous oversight and is considering legislation to ensure Iran continues to be held accountable. #IranDeal
Now armed with $100 billion, Iran will have vast new resources to sponsor terrorism and fund its nuclear and missile programs. #IranDeal
I opposed this flawed #IranDeal and fear its implementation shifts the leverage to Iran as sanctions are lifted.
Today cannot be the beginning of the U.S. and Europe turning a blind eye to the troubling threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. #IranDeal
While I am delighted our citizens are being released from #Iran, we need to know all the details and implications, including its timing.

Sen. Coons (D-Del.): “It would be really regrettable” if senators “didn't ultimately…cast our votes for or against this deal.” #BadIranDeal
This is a deal with a regime whose leader says one of our closest allies won’t exist in 25 years. #BadIranDeal http://t.co/U21EFeRFWh

A final vote on a resolution of disapproval at 60-vote threshold was never part of the construction of the bill and is nowhere in the text.
This debate should be focused on the substance of the president’s #BadIranDeal. http://t.co/khP6JAPEJs
