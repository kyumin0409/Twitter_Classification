Senate Republicans just confirmed McNamee to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This year, Christmas came early for the executives who want American families to foot the bill for coal bailouts. https://t.co/9FOnM2Bh06
It’s time for Congress to hold companies accountable for their misuse &amp; abuse of Americans’ private data by passing my bill that will create REAL accountability &amp; penalties for corporations &amp; executives who fail to act responsibly with private data. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX
New info makes it clear that @facebook went out of its way to scrape Americans’ cell phone data, knowing it wouldn’t sit well with the public. These shady schemes are exactly why companies must be required to disclose how they’re handling &amp; sharing data. https://t.co/qQRgOJz7yg
Honored tonight to receive the @StateForesters Bernard L. Orell Award for successfully working on the bipartisan fix to the long-running @forestservice fire borrowing debacle. Great to have such dedicated partners in forest policy leadership! https://t.co/m3LeByLvBA
Trump’s public charge rule does not embody the America we know. There are only five days left for the public to submit comments regarding the public charge rule. Make your voice heard by commenting on this issue HERE: https://t.co/23lRVfLzm6
The Trump administration’s public charge rule combines racism, cruelty, and economic self-harm in one policy. Nobody should have to choose between their child’s health and whether or not they’re able to remain in the United States.
I’m demanding @TheJusticeDept provide information about shady financial connections of top DOJ officials, including current acting AG Whitaker. We know DOJ leaders worked for a shadowy dark-money group and a Russian bank. What other conflicts are they hiding? https://t.co/dmot4rYIQU
I’m live NOW on the senate floor. Tune in to @wydenpress for live updates. https://t.co/ylmct0Xukk
I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor soon against McNamee's nomination to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. His record speaks for itself. If confirmed, he will be tasked with regulating the very industry he has spent his career working for.
Drug companies got away with misclassifying &amp; overcharging Medicaid for prescription drugs. My bill ensures that Mylan and other companies who gouge consumers by raising prices by double digits each year cannot profit further by taking advantage of taxpayers.
Drug makers manipulated the system to rip off taxpayers while families have been struggling to afford life-saving medications like EpiPens. I introduced legislation with @ChuckGrassley to stop games that come at the expense of Medicaid. https://t.co/o3YvDfpMTN
I joined @AC360 to discuss new developments in the Trump-Russia investigation. https://t.co/2GtU3KGZTN
Brigette Heather Harrington from Hillsboro won a statewide essay contest for her poem about what sharing this piece of Oregon with the rest of the country means to her. I was fortunate enough to hear Brigette present her poem at this morning's event. https://t.co/ql5dF1jmdY
Thrilled to join the @forestservice &amp; officials from Sweet Home, Oregon this morning to celebrate the arrival of the Capitol Christmas Tree from @willametteNF. Oregon does a lot of things well, but one of the things we do best is grow Christmas trees. https://t.co/7Kw5x6ndeB
One year ago the @FCC reversed critical #NetNeutrality rules &amp; I went to the Senate floor to talk about why equal internet access is so vital for every American. The House has until Dec. 10 to take real action &amp; vote on the CRA to restore REAL #NetNeutrality https://t.co/5vXv2eOiKM
I'm demanding the Trump administration stop its illegal efforts to limit the ability of refugees to seek asylum in the United States. This cruel policy undermines law &amp; order in our immigration system &amp; poses a threat to those seeking safety in our country.https://t.co/P4RXYewmJj
At this morning’s #OLSummit in Portland w/moderator @Zapproved CEO @monica_enand, I joined w/ @SenJeffMerkley to share our ideas with the @OreBusinessPlan for opportunities to make real gains on tax reform, health care, trade enforcement, wildfires, election security, hemp &amp; more https://t.co/RtomHIXNA7
Very much enjoyed catching up with southern Oregon leaders at this morning’s #OLSummit in Portland &amp; talking with them about tax reform, healthcare, education, cybersecurity, recreation, wildfires &amp; other topics essential to quality-of-life throughout our state. https://t.co/hP9CwESGWD
Big thanks to all who attended yesterday’s Lane County #2018townhall in Eugene for a real #OregonWay conversation about election security, wildfires, climate change, campaign finance reform, health care and many other issues on Oregonians’ minds. https://t.co/hBHVWJpJKY
Glad to hear that @DroneSeed is now able to use its technology to support Oregon’s agricultural production &amp; to combat wildfire destruction in the West. Excited to see what more this innovative technology can do to help Oregonians. https://t.co/r33JX0q8im
Before today’s #2018townhall in Lane County, my friend @manningstl &amp; I met with these smart &amp; engaged @4JSchools students at South Eugene HS. Enjoyed #ListeningToTheFuture &amp; hearing the students’ thoughts on criminal justice, green energy, climate change &amp; more. https://t.co/mjrXsusEq3
Today in Eugene and every day throughout Oregon I am so proud to #StandWithPP to celebrate the essential healthcare that @ppsworegon &amp; @PPFA provide for millions of women in our state and nationwide. https://t.co/wWFjXzzdUW
Looking forward to tomorrow’s #OLSummit in Portland with @SenJeffMerkley &amp; so many long-time friends from the @OreBusinessPlan who are committed to the #OregonWay of finding solutions that help all parts of our state.

I joined @allinwithchris to discuss how new details in the Russia investigation prove that @realDonaldTrump is putting his bank accounts first. https://t.co/thxOk45zUw
Clackamas County showed with yesterday’s #2018townhall how democracy is alive &amp; thriving in Oregon. Enjoyed the robust discussion at my 912th overall town hall about climate change, wildfires, DACA, election security, health care &amp; more. https://t.co/6HgQuxy3iL
Freedom of the press is fundamental to American democracy. As the son of a journalist, I am proud to stand with my colleagues to ensure that the crucial work of reporters across the country is encouraged, not demonized. https://t.co/biGAgW5ySg
Inspired this morning in Portland by the Oregon students who organized #WhatNowPDX &amp; educated me about their fresh ideas for solving challenges facing our state and country. https://t.co/DmRtWTsKSb
President George H.W. Bush will always be remembered for his core decency &amp; how he managed the fall of the Berlin Wall. My dad, who wrote a book on the Wall, admired that feat. So did I.
What a great 50th #2018townhall today in Tualatin. Thanks @TuHS_Wolves &amp; Washington County for a thoughtful conversation about climate change, Medicare, election security &amp; more. #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/gHBcwJaHmU
Fantastic start in Portland this morning with a tasty donut from @BlueStarDonuts &amp; a great meeting with company CEO Katie Poppe. https://t.co/E8C0z0KTef
Eager to hear from young Oregonians in Portland tomorrow at #WhatNowPDX. Change doesn’t come from the top down, it starts at the grass roots with engaged students like these: https://t.co/WcQmc0DOUJ
Congress must take action to give the @FTC real power to go after companies that misuse &amp; lose Americans’ private information. It can start by passing my bill to require fines &amp; jail time for senior execs who don’t take privacy seriously: https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX
If history is any guide, @Marriott’s mega data breach will be treated like all the others: the company will apologize &amp; offer useless credit monitoring to the victims impacted. The status quo isn’t working.
The American people have been sold a bill of goods on @realDonaldTrump and @pfizer’s deal to keep drug prices low. This blatant manipulation is the latest costly example of Big Pharma keeping drug prices high while families continue to pay more and more.
.@pfizer's CEO recently said it was back to “business as normal” after playing make-believe with Trump on his promise to lower drug prices. https://t.co/ruEEujTSHy
Taxpayers &amp; seniors with Medicare are overpaying for @pfizer’s drug #Lyrica. Affordable generics were supposed to become available next month. Now, thanks to the broken drug system this is no longer a reality. https://t.co/0EgSAnzzx4
The #OregonWay + world-renowned Oregon craft beer = a great way to help people recover from the #CampFire: https://t.co/80YMUkHQe8
Any new trade agreement entered into by the United States must be enforceable. I remain concerned that the president’s deal doesn’t do enough to protect American workers and businesses. My full statement here: https://t.co/y0Rh4i91pW
I’ve got a #2018townhall today in Tualatin, one tomorrow in Milwaukie &amp; one on Sunday in Eugene. All are welcome to attend &amp; ask any question. For more details on times and locations for these town halls in Washington, Clackamas &amp; Lane counties: https://t.co/3cGcudbITA

Good luck to @TimbersFC tonight in KC. Looking forward to Portland staying on track to bring the #MLSCup back where it belongs. #OnwardRoseCity #RCTID
Thrilled that my bill with @SenFeinstein to improve national earthquake preparedness will soon become law. This bill will modernize earthquake-safety programs, keeping communities in Oregon and nationwide safer during these disasters. https://t.co/GHeNA2hk4O
My full statement here: https://t.co/BfF6mnSuOi
The @realDonaldTrump administration is creating a tale of two health care systems by opening the flood gates for junk insurance plans. One for the healthy and wealthy, and one for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/fVdL14332I
276,000 children lost health coverage in the Trump admin's 1st year - an appalling effect of constant Republican health care sabotage. No doubt that without affordable access to doctors, many of these kids will face permanent consequences. https://t.co/h12LNbTVOV
The House has until Dec 10 to vote on the resolution to reinstate real #NetNeutrality, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support earlier this year. This will stop corporations from creating fast &amp; slow lanes on the internet &amp; getting even richer at the expense of consumers.
Today is the #NetNeutrality Day of Action. Congress should commit to reinstating REAL #NetNeutrality to the internet this year. It’s time for the House to take action and restore equal access to the internet for all Americans. https://t.co/QdN2bxTuUU
I joined @REI &amp; @pewenvironment to discuss the importance of protecting public lands &amp; celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers Act. As an Oregonian I know firsthand the value of these resources. I will continue fighting to preserve them for generations to come. https://t.co/xhZOpXUJfL

Today, the Senate moved closer to ending America's involvement in the horrific Saudi-led war in Yemen that has brought about an ongoing, brutal humanitarian crisis. My full statement here: https://t.co/si7bGaiC58
ICE is targeting potential caretakers of unaccompanied children, leaving capable &amp; willing family members too scared to step forward &amp; provide a safe home. My bill with @SenKamalaHarris would put an end to this &amp; help these kids get the care they need. https://t.co/uesd65Udpd https://t.co/ZMgOnqxQ7k
With Americans making fewer donations to charity under the #GOPSTaxScam, it’s more important than ever to contribute to your local charities. https://t.co/gj03X9tNrI
Unnamed donors gave millions to back Trump’s partisan #SCOTUS nominees. My bill with @SenatorTester to overturn existing rules protecting dark money donors would expose these four people. It's time to shed a light on dark money in American politics. https://t.co/27eLNPxN1L https://t.co/iwB0Dg0xBN
ICYMI: @senatemajldr is trying to rush the confirmation of Thomas Farr to serve as a federal judge. Maybe because he's trying to hide Farr’s dedication to undermining civil &amp; voting rights, proving that he is not qualified to serve in this position. https://t.co/8LOeZmgtKk
Today Senate Republicans jammed McNamee’s confirmation through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We are one step closer to letting the coal companies pick your pocket. I will continue to fight this nomination. https://t.co/9n33YrK33h
Using the media as a middleman to distribute tax proposals did not garner Republicans any bipartisan support for their 2017 tax bill, and it won’t garner any bipartisanship now. https://t.co/UFzh1HjNTL
Today, @MartinHeinrch, @SenJackReed and I are introducing legislation that will require the intelligence community to provide a public report on what they know. https://t.co/4SIMGxfJQr
The Trump administration is refusing to tell the American people what it knows about Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Protecting our public lands is the #OregonWay. Great to meet with my friend Chad &amp; his @SR_RunsDeep team today to hear from young leaders about what matters most to them about preserving Oregon’s beloved outdoor spaces. https://t.co/ERIWETTqtb
My full statement here: https://t.co/oyAe4llD7e
Today @HHSGov released a report that the Trump administration waived background checks for staff members in charge of holding unaccompanied children in U.S. custody. The administration will stop at nothing to drive its hateful and ineffective anti-immigrant agenda. https://t.co/mC3kKTZgek

Oregon has been leading the way to make voting easier and more accessible for everyone. Expanding #VoteByMail is safer and increases voter turnout, all while saving taxpayer dollars. Read more about my bill to expand vote by mail HERE: https://t.co/KVKHihYAeX
Congress can and should be doing more to prevent voter suppression and increase turnout at the polls. It can start by passing my bill to make #VoteByMail the law of the land. Voting is a right, not a privilege. It’s time for #PaperBallotsNow https://t.co/ugykJTOjV7
The Trump administration is politicizing this tragedy to push damaging policies that will harm our forests. Instead, it should be supporting existing fire prevention tools it praised earlier this year. https://t.co/UBDI88psvH
Trump is shrinking the size of our beloved national monuments in order to give a handout to the coal &amp; gas industry. Congress has a Constitutional duty to oversee the protection of these iconic lands. This is executive overreach by Trump, plain and simple. https://t.co/LfbikSgjom
If the Trump administration refuses to tell the American people what it knows about Saudi Arabia's involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, I will introduce legislation requiring the U.S. Intelligence Community to publicly release an assessment. My full statement here: https://t.co/1hwXl537Ip
David Bernhardt had a front row seat to the scandals at Bush's Interior Department. Now, he is #2 at Interior &amp; enabling Zinke. . . . all while driving Trump's agenda that threatens our public lands. https://t.co/RWDdq9tki5
The president continues to bob and weave when it comes to who is responsible for killing Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. U.S. Intelligence leaders should provide a public assessment of who ordered this brutal murder. https://t.co/wnTz5NbZat
Thank you Marian Wright Edelman for your service to @ChildDefender. Your incredible work to erradicate child poverty and inequality has inspired generations of leaders around the world, and changed the lives of countless children and families. https://t.co/oIzpWzlbCm
Families are forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying for care they need. Trump has failed to followed through on his promises. The next Congress needs to get serious about lowering drug prices.
Once again, @realDonaldTrump fails to close the deal. Just weeks after declaring “victory” on drug prices, Big Pharma is back to business as usual. https://t.co/m9gL38qqBQ
Someone cozied up with wealthy coal execs has no place at the helm of the agency tasked with protecting the air we breathe and water we drink. https://t.co/lNcd0i2CnJ
I joined @OutFrontCNN to discuss the need to protect the Mueller investigation &amp; for Congress to put real protections in place to safeguard Americans from misuse of their private data by companies like @facebook: https://t.co/HZIyVHwTKb
The public has been waiting decades for the @DeptofDefense to undergo an audit as required by law. I pushed them to fix this issue for years. The first step to solving problems is admitting you have one. https://t.co/iIlQfwNRXX
For too long, e-cigarette companies have refused to take responsibility for how their products hurt kids. This is a welcome step by the FDA, but it can’t stop here. This public health crisis must end &amp; our kids must be protected. https://t.co/mqgQB31vkK
I agree with @choo_ek and all of the docs, nurses &amp; first responders that say #ThisISOurLane. Gun violence is a national health care emergency and must be addressed as the epidemic that it is. https://t.co/5XQCl44pvF
Today @PeterWelch &amp; I are introducing a bill to make school lunches healthier for kids by expanding access to unprocessed local fruits &amp; vegetables. No child should go hungry &amp; every child deserves healthy, nutritious meals. https://t.co/nNsQzG5YO1
My bill will level the playing field for the middle class by creating incentives for workers to save more, and by restoring a retirement savings program eliminated by the Trump administration last year.
Cost-of-living is soaring with working families having less and less to save for their futures. Today I’m introducing a bill to address this retirement crisis. https://t.co/skw5QTcjFG
A corporation that stoops this low in response to legitimate criticism should not be trusted with your personal information. Congress must adopt my proposal to create real privacy rules with teeth. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX
Facebook has not only refused to effectively crack down on hate-spewing Nazis, the New York Times revealed it actually encouraged anti-Semitism by hiring degenerate right-wing propagandists to concoct conspiracies that tap into anti-Semitic biases.
The truth of Facebook’s conduct behind the scenes – tapping into anti-Semitism, spreading fake news and hiding the facts of Russia’s election interference – could not be further from what Mark Zuckerberg told the Senate his company was all about: https://t.co/C3oGuaGzBF
Individuals that promote anti-Semitic bile, like Definers, and the people at Facebook who hired them, threaten not just our safety, but our democracy.
Bernard McNamee’s record speaks for itself. This is simply more of the same from the Trump administration as it continues to prop up its industry friends, and at the expense of American families struggling to pay their utility bills. https://t.co/QBkWDrDUru
Nominating McNamee is like putting a fox inside the chicken coop. He worked to pick the pockets of American families to bail out coal and nuclear corporations—a policy rejected outright by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Now, Trump wants McNamee on that Commission. https://t.co/14qO4llC04
With hate crimes and acts of violence against the Jewish community on the rise, someone who makes statements like this should not be in the Justice Department, let alone become Attorney General of the United States. https://t.co/iZPtF1bQh2
More evidence that the #OregonWay spirit of volunteering is alive and well: https://t.co/aRcHPMfCK5
The administration’s affinity for criminalizing immigrant communities is harming children. Congress must put an end to these cruel policies. It can start by passing this legislation to ensure that kids get access to the help they need.
.@SenKamalaHarris &amp; I are introducing a bill to stop the administration from using taxpayer dollars to incite fear &amp; prioritize the well-being of unaccompanied children by placing them with families &amp; providing vital resources. https://t.co/uesd65Udpd
The @realDonaldTrump administration never fails to take a cruel &amp; inhumane approach to immigration policy. Babies ripped away from their parents, children in cages &amp; reliance on damaging institutional care instead of what the experts know is best for kids.
If @BetsyDeVosED and @realDonaldTrump actually cared about the well-being of survivors, this is the last thing they would do. We should be empowering survivors to speak up, not stifling them. https://t.co/CuVE2MhWKF
Learn more about my bill to expand #VoteByMail to every state HERE: https://t.co/KVKHiigbDx
Experts know that one of the biggest ways to increase voter turnout is #VoteByMail. Oregon and Colorado have led the way on making voting easier and more accessible. It’s time for Congress to follow suit and pass my bill to expand Oregon-style #VoteByMail to every state.
Americans came to the polls in record numbers last week and states like Oregon with #VoteByMail led the way. Now Congress needs to seize that momentum to make it easier to vote, not harder. https://t.co/vb4rZIYxml
The @realDonaldTrump administration has made it clear that it will not to take the necessary precautions to protect our election systems. Congress needs to take action immediately and pass my PAVE Act to mandate a paper trail for every ballot. https://t.co/WIoprQwnCM
A lot more than you’d think. Voting machines and outdated technology are leaving the foundation of our democracy vulnerable to hackers and foreign governments. https://t.co/jwlOnL65BX
When you look at the hate-fueled, racist agenda @realDonaldTrump has been pushing, it’s no surprise that hate crimes are on the rise. We must continue to condemn these actions and make it clear that hatred and bigotry have no place in America. https://t.co/3XpyAu5Gfk

It’s clear the American people can’t take private companies at face value when they claim to be protecting their data. It’s time for Congress to step in. It can start by passing my legislation to provide real protections for Americans’ privacy. https://t.co/CKQJ04C3XX
NEW from @nytimes: @facebook failed to keep track of how third parties it worked with used Americans’ private data and information. It’s time for companies to be held accountable for failing to protect Americans’ privacy. https://t.co/EZmQcULoDG
Trump refuses to lead on protecting our elections from Russia and then lies about made-up fraud. For real security, pass the PAVE Act #PaperBallotsNow https://t.co/yLXQ4WECmH
We have to do more to reduce this scourge of veteran suicides in our state. I’m proud that Oregon’s @Lines_for_Life will be expanding its Veterans Crisis Line to help veterans nationwide. https://t.co/nrkizpb3LY
Mental &amp; physical health care are a must for our veterans. At yesterday’s service in Albany, I shared a valuable resource here in Oregon - the Veterans Crisis Line at @Lines_for_Life - 1-800-273-8255 https://t.co/9ltV6iHlQF

Because he’s unhappy that this week, the American people rejected his platform of hatred, bigotry, and fear, @realDonaldTrump wants to throw Americans’ votes in the garbage. https://t.co/7uCDFnS5dt
Great news heading into this #VeteransDay weekend: @Lines_for_Life in Portland officially  became the main support line for the national Veterans Crisis Line. A real tribute to Lines for Life’s teamwork with @RepBonamici

Congress must take action immediately to secure our voting systems &amp; do away with the barriers facing Americans who want to make their voices heard. Participating in our democracy shouldn’t be the hardest thing you do all day. Read more about my bill here: https://t.co/WIoprQwnCM
My PAVE Act takes two major steps to enhance voting security: require paper ballots &amp; risk-limiting audits for all federal elections. These are concrete steps that Congress can take to protect the foundation of our democracy.
Voters in Georgia experienced four hour waits to cast their ballots. In Illinois, some ballots were incomplete with pages missing. In Michigan, ballots were being rejected with no explanation because of improperly functioning equipment &amp; power outages. https://t.co/uCl3Gk5NQ2
Americans witnessed record voter turnout this week. They also experienced outrageous barriers to voting. https://t.co/geXGG0mXyl
By passing my national #VoteByMail bill, Congress can make it clear they want people to vote, while saving taxpayer dollars. Voting is a right, not a privilege. Read more about my bill here: https://t.co/KVKHiigbDx
Thanks to #VoteByMail and automatic registration, voter turnout in Oregon this week reached record highs. Oregonians already know that #VoteByMail makes it easier for teachers, students, working parents &amp; nurses to make their voices heard. https://t.co/CGySGNVs6r

Mounting barriers to voting for millions of Americans demonstrates the need for Congress to take action and make paper ballots &amp; #VoteByMail the law of the land. Voting is a right, not a luxury. #PaperBallotsNow #VoteAtHome https://t.co/cXz15NIoaF
You can track your ballot after voting. Visit https://t.co/pO2PuQS7ZC to follow your ballot. #VoteByMail #VoteAtHome
With Election Day 2 days away, It’s too late to mail your ballots. Find your nearest ballot drop box and #Vote: https://t.co/3AFNk0FneT
Here’s how easy Oregon’s #VoteByMail is - Yesterday I voted at my dining room table and dropped off my ballot at the library. #VoteAtHome is the #OregonWay #PaperBallotsNow https://t.co/fAhS082Mpg
There is bipartisan agreement in OR that #VoteByMail with #PaperBallotsNow works! It’s not new- it’s 20 years old and it’s simple &amp; secure. You can even #VoteAtHome. It’s the #OregonWay https://t.co/2CnM4HbUh8

Here are key lessons and recommendations from my year-long investigation that shows how nursing homes have failed to adequately prepare to protect seniors during natural disasters. https://t.co/cZCuZQahNf
This problem isn’t going away. #ClimateChange is making extreme weather events more severe &amp; common, so nursing homes need to be better prepared for natural disasters to avoid tragedies like the those that we witnessed in 2017.
Families expect their loved ones to be safe and cared for in nursing homes. My report shows that these facilities aren’t prepared for natural disasters. @CMSGov &amp; state regulators MUST do more to guarantee the safety of seniors during hurricanes. https://t.co/sKClLCspwn
Today I released the findings of a year-long investigation examining how systemic failures at Texas and Florida nursing homes put seniors in danger during the 2017 hurricane season. #HurricaneSafety https://t.co/WcaH466xhh

Congress must take action to increase transparency about how corporations sell, share &amp; use data. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to put measures in place that will put consumers back in the driver’s seat when it comes to controlling their own data.
There need to be consequences when corporations don’t protect your data. My bill will put reckless CEOs in jail if they lie about protecting your personal information.
My bill will protect Americans’ privacy &amp; data by:
✅Establishing minimum cybersecurity standards
✅Giving consumers more control over their own information &amp; who gains access to it
✅Requiring companies to take responsibility for protecting consumers &amp; their info
It’s time to hold companies accountable. This week I’m rolling out draft legislation to establish standards for privacy &amp; cybersecurity, &amp; empower watchdogs to do their jobs, safeguarding Americans from the misuse of their own information by third parties. https://t.co/CKQJ04kszn
Consumer data collection &amp; new technology have posed an unprecedented threat to Americans’ privacy. The federal government &amp; private companies have failed to implement policies that protect private data &amp; information.

Trump doesn't want the next week to be about his attacks on health care or his admin's smash-and-grab corruption, so he's reverting to race-baiting. Attacking the constitutional foundations of citizenship and wastefully militarizing the border are acts of desperation and cruelty.
.@realDonaldTrump again turns a taxpayer-funded speech into a political rally. This time at the FFA convention. The American people need answers for when they will be reimbursed for his partisan campaign events. I'm demanding they get them: https://t.co/9VoUo0SLD5 https://t.co/ww0svvBymC

Georgia’s Secretary of State says that absentee voting is a “privilege and a convenience”. What a disgrace. Every voter in Oregon gets a ballot by mail. Voting is a right. https://t.co/4S6v2DLr53
It is flatly unacceptable and un-American for Brian Kemp to force thousands and thousands of voters to wait in long lines just to cast their ballots on ancient, insecure voting machines. #PaperBallotsNOW
Imagine if Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp put as much energy into replacing Georgia’s insecure, paperless voting machines as he does suppressing minority voters. #PaperBallotsNOW
There are no minimum federal standards for voting machines. Plus the shady companies who make them have stonewalled Congressional oversight. #PaperBallotsNOW https://t.co/lCumKAzEo5
Another story today about security problems plaguing the top election machine companies from @AP. When we can’t depend on corporations, we need #PaperBallotsNow https://t.co/Onhidlv1DD

Last week, @senatemajldr doubled down, promising to gut your Medicare &amp; Social Security coverage in order to pay for Trump’s massive giveaway to the rich.  https://t.co/kdpZRKUAgj
Here’s what the #GOPTaxScam does accomplish:
✔️Safeguards tax avoidance schemes for the wealthy &amp; well connected
✔️Rewards corporations for shipping jobs overseas
✔️Creates a corporate stock buyback bonanza for wealthy execs
.@realDonaldTrump promised the #GOPTaxScam would boost wages by $4,000. That never happened. Trump’s tax law showers his own donors and cronies with massive tax breaks and encourages wealthy families like his own to continue their tradition of gaming the system.
Trump family tax fraud became the blueprint for the #GOPTaxScam, encouraging the wealthy to dodge taxes at the expense of middle-class families.
NEW: today I released a report showing how Trump’s tax law keeps the Trump family tax fraud tradition alive. https://t.co/4VeAp6vEss

Your Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and coverage for pre-existing conditions are all at risk. I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that these vital resources for America's seniors are safeguarded from political games.

Congress should be protecting and strengthening #SocialSecurity benefits, not pushing radical changes to Social Security like the president's aides and congressional Republicans have proposed.
Working Americans earn #SocialSecurity by paying in with every paycheck. A lifetime of work and contributions means they deserve a secure retirement - not worrying about which bills to pay.
Social Security benefits will automatically go up by a small amount next year. That's better than nothing but not enough to keep up with seniors' health care and prescription costs. https://t.co/vv5RMmKehp

I fear many survivors will conclude that coming forward with their story will prove pointless, and there is very little likelihood of justice. This signals to boys that even if you engage in violence against women and lie about your conduct, the power structure will protect you.
Kavnaugh stands credibly accused of sexually assaulting multiple women. The record shows he lied about his history with warrantless wiretapping and his personal history on matters big and small.

Evidence shows Kavanaugh has lied repeatedly. Liars do NOT belong on the Supreme Court. #StopKavanaugh
He lied about provable facts, like the drinking age in Maryland at the time.
He lied about when he learned of the second set of allegations made against him.
He lied repeatedly about the statements made by the other individuals who were present at the party where Dr. Ford was assaulted.
He lied about his involvement in government wiretapping programs.
He lied about his involvement in the confirmation process of certain Bush nominees.
He lied about his use of stolen documents.
Brett Kavanaugh is NOT on trial for misconduct in his youth. He’s interviewing for a job as a Supreme Court Justice. Kavanaugh perjured himself. That's disqualifying. Here are just some of his lies:
It’s extremely troubling that the public is unable to know the extent of Kavanaugh’s involvement in illegal surveillance before he’s rushed through for a lifetime seat on #SCOTUS. The Senate should NOT confirm this nominee. https://t.co/Z96km3HhHU

.@realDonaldTrump said he wanted a full background check. What he delivered was a whitewash. An investigation isn't legitimate if dozens of key witnesses are never interviewed. The Senate will be committing gross negligence if it confirms this nominee.
@realDonaldTrump These media reports represent serious and credible allegations of potentially illegal tax fraud, based on extensive documentation. It’s critical that IRS fully investigate these allegations and prosecute any violations to the fullest extent of the law.

One thing is clear: In @realDonaldTrump's eyes, paying taxes is for the little guy.
.@realDonaldTrump talks nonstop about caring for our vets, supporting law enforcement and strengthening our military. Through fraud and tax cheating, he skipped out on paying his fair share for any of it.
Trump is not a “self-made billionaire.” @realDonaldTrump is a deceptive tax cheat and fraud who was handed more than $413 million from his dad’s real estate empire.  
https://t.co/iSqTXo1Roa
Now we know the truth. Decades before @realDonaldTrump was mocking assault survivors at political rallies, he was committing fraud, inheriting dad’s wealth, and fabricating a creation myth he’s lied about ever since. 
https://t.co/HnmwmY9Js1
There’s a strict set of tax rules that applies to most Americans. @realDonaldTrump cheated to made sure it didn’t apply to him. Republicans in Congress are making sure it doesn’t apply to other wealthy tax cheats, either. 
https://t.co/cJ5fQyALCs
The rampant fraud. The sweetheart deals. The “catch me if you can” tax dodges. This story about the Trump family’s tax cheating is a perfect illustration of how the fortunate few heap a heavier burden onto middle-class Americans.

I applaud Senator Flake and my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for pressuring Republican leaders to take this basic step toward getting to the bottom of the allegations, and assessing Kavanaugh’s suitability for the Supreme Court.
The Senate has no duty more important than providing advice and consent on #SCOTUS nominations, and the American people expect the two parties to work together to accomplish that task.
A thorough FBI investigation of the multiple sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh is the absolute minimum needed to vet a nominee for a lifetime appointment to #SCOTUS

Serving on the Supreme Court is a unique privilege. I will forcefully oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination.
The clear contrast between these two witnesses – one composed individual who gave thorough answers based on a clear recollection of her trauma, and another who repeatedly dodged questions – will be seared into Americans’ memories for generations.
Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony demonstrated he lacks both the judgment and the temperament Americans expect from a #SCOTUS Justice. The best that can be said of his testimony is that it was strikingly evasive.
Dr. Ford’s brave testimony today gave hope to survivors everywhere. I cannot imagine a more compelling witness. #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord

Credible allegations deserve a credible process. The Senate has an obligation to provide vigorous oversight, and Republican senators don't want to be part of it.

Attacking these women and jamming the Kavanaugh nomination through while these allegations of sexual misconduct mount would go down among the darkest moments in Senate history. Republicans still on the fence must decide if they want to be a part of it.
There’s a sea-change happening across the country with respect to the treatment of women and sexual misconduct. What’s happening with Kavanaugh’s nomination shows Republicans in Washington don’t get it – and are content ignoring it.
There’s no reason – other than a shameful desire to win at any cost – to rush this process, block an FBI investigation into these multiple allegations and force a Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
Calling for these women to be heard &amp; for their allegations to be investigated isn’t a “smear campaign.” Even if you believe Kavanaugh, you should welcome a routine FBI background check! But Leader McConnell &amp; the admin. are blocking it. Why don’t they want to get to the truth?
Multiple women have come forward with credible allegations of sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh. Speaking out was a huge sacrifice of safety and privacy. Now they’re being called liars and attacked as if it’s all a political stunt.
This is as cynical as politics get in Washington. #StopKavanaugh

@SecAzar Meanwhile, Big Pharma is trying to airdrop a bailout into an unrelated piece of legislation that would cost taxpayers billions AND increase seniors’ Medicare premiums. I’m fighting this effort to pad Big Pharma’s bottom line that would shift costs onto seniors.
Trump’s top health care official, @SecAzar, *never* lowered drug prices while he was a Big Pharma executive. Why would his former pharma colleagues start now? Trump's drug plan is all talk, no action. https://t.co/5rmLMb7fQy

The Trump admin is yet again combining racism, cruelty and economic self-harm in one policy to target seniors who count on Medicare for affordable prescriptions, caregivers in America’s nursing homes and daycares, and workers who contribute to every sector of the economy.
Immigrants do not take from this country, they add to it. The Trump administration is too blinded by racism to understand that. https://t.co/JYZY76vTg7
Trump’s new policy harms rural areas with declining populations that are starved for residents who want to build a better life for their families and contribute to the community. This anti-immigrant policy will be a disaster.
Given the serious and credible assault allegations against him, the FBI MUST reopen Kavanaugh’s background investigation. Republicans’ plan to rush his nomination for a LIFETIME seat before a simple investigation has been conducted is a farce.

The Trump admin’s change had NO debate in @SenateFinance and NO debate on the Senate floor before it became law of the land.
Before, dark money groups were required to disclose their donors to the IRS. Now, the Trump admin is letting MORE dark money and foreign money into our politics without any disclosure. This is unjustifiable.
I’m voting NO on Trump’s pick for IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, because Trump’s IRS and @USTreasury are making it easier for dark money and foreign money to undermine our democracy. I’m speaking out on the Senate floor: https://t.co/u1UctJrLgP

On #SCOTUS, Kavanaugh would have power to decimate women’s privacy and overturn #RoevWade, nix protections for preexisting conditions &amp; hand Big Brother and corporations MORE power over individuals. Hiding his background from the American people is unconscionable.
HOURS BEFORE THE HEARINGS BEGAN, the Trump admin dropped 42,000 pages of documents on the Senate - only a drop in the bucket! The process @ChuckGrassley’s leading is not advice and consent. It’s a rubber stamp for Trump’s #SCOTUS pick. #WhatAreTheyHiding?

ALL clean air refugees deserve the same consideration as other disaster victims forced to seek temporary shelter.
https://t.co/pJZhvQDRwd
It would also let clean air refugees seek temporary housing aid if they live someplace where air quality index is determined to be unhealthy for at least 3 consecutive days as the result of a wildfire declared a major disaster by the President or Governor of the affected state.
This bill would let people seeking temporary shelter from wildfire smoke apply for relief under a FEMA program that covers temporary lodging for people who can’t immediately return home after a disaster.
I introduced the Clean Air Refugee Assistance Act to help "clean air refugees" - children suffering from asthma, seniors needing respirators to breathe or anybody who’s suffering from unhealthy smoke.
Wildfires in Oregon and across the West are getting bigger, hotter and harder to fight. Scientists say they're only getting worse.

Kavanaugh has shown again and again that he will side with Big Business and Big Cable against the interests of regular consumers. If you are for REAL #NetNeutrality and a free and open internet, you need to say NO to Kavanaugh.
ALL businesses and entrepreneurs have the right to a fair playing field on the internet, and Verizon’s profits are NOT more important than First Responders’ access to unlimited communications services that keep us safe!
Kavanaugh’s position goes against a free &amp; open internet. #NetNeutrality means paying your internet access fee, then getting to go where you want, when you want, on the web. Corporations do NOT have 1stamendment rights that trump an individual’s fair access to the internet!
Last year, Judge Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion claiming that internet providers have a 1st Amendment right to decide what part of the internet YOU can see. This is bordering on absurdity, and shows that he might not understand what #NetNeutrality actually means.
Kavanaugh believes that Comcast and Verizon can decide what you see and where you go online - and that any limit to this power is somehow a violation of their 1st Amendment rights.
I joined my @SenateDems colleagues in urging D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge @AjitPaiFCC &amp; the @FCC’s decision to end #NetNeutrality and restore EQUAL access to the internet.

I want Chairman @ChuckGrassley, Ranking Member @SenFeinstein and the administration to know that I am ready and willing to work with them on finding a nominee who deserves a seat on the Ninth Circuit.
Republican leaders tried to throw out 101 years of bipartisan Senate tradition to seat a deeply flawed nominee on the federal bench. Today’s victory was a red-letter day in the Senate.
I’m the child of Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany. To read what Mr. Bounds wrote was a slap in the face &amp; I imagine there are millions of people across the country who would feel the same way. That’s why @senJeffMerkley &amp; I withheld our blue slips from his nomination.
Ryan Bounds flagrantly misrepresented his background, lying to cover up disturbing, intolerant writings from his past &amp; in my view, that means he’s disqualified from sitting on the federal bench. Here’s the bottom line: today, constant pressure against a bad nominee won out.

Ryan Bounds’ nomination process will forever change how judicial nominations are handled. It will further DIVIDE the Congress, and it will further divide the courts along partisan lines.
Every member of the Republican conference DEMANDED @SenatorLeahy and President Obama respect the blue slip process in 2009. They did. What Republicans are doing now is HYPOCRITICAL. #CourtsMatter
What @ChuckGrassley and @SenateMajLdr have done cheapens the “advise and consent” responsibility of the Senate and hands more power to @realDonaldTrump and the executive branch. It will be an open question whether the current structure of the courts will survive. #CourtsMatter
Bounds’ nomination is the FIRST time in the 101-year history of the blue slip process that a nomination moved forward without a blue slip from either home-state Senator. This is extremely disrespectful to the decades-old bipartisan Oregon judicial selection process. #CourtsMatter
Several committee members wrote to @SenJeffMerkley and I that if the material had been revealed EARLIER, they would have disqualified Ryan Bounds. Bounds misled the bipartisan committee that reviewed his candidacy.
Ryan Bounds only acknowledged what he wrote AFTER it became public and threatened his nomination. He has not recanted the views they reflect. #CourtsMatter
Ryan Bounds purposefully withheld disqualifying information from the Oregon bipartisan judicial selection committee. These writings were sexist, racist, and intolerant of the LGBTQ community.

We need to grow things in America, make things in America, add value to them in America, and then ship them outside of America. To do that, American manufacturers need access to critical minerals. My opening statement at today’s @EnergyDems hearing: https://t.co/DT3SR9XmwW
Trump’s chaos strategy on trade threatens access to these critical minerals, and it’ll be American manufacturers and American workers who suffer for it.
Imported critical minerals are needed to make solar cells, wind turbines &amp; batteries that are moving our country to a cheaper, low-carbon energy future. They’re essential to creating red-white-and-blue jobs. The clean energy economy alone supports 6.4 MILLION jobs across America
The Trump admin is promoting an unfair policy of tariffs on critical minerals that hurts U.S. companies’ ability to compete, while also gutting environmental laws. Keeping China in the driver’s seat puts family-wage jobs, clean air and water at risk.
This is why I’ll be opposing Charles Rettig, nominee to be IRS Commissioner unless he commits to restoring this critical IRS disclosure requirement.

We’ve been hearing this same promise for months. When will there be REAL action for the millions of Americans getting mugged by soaring drug prices at the pharmacy window? 
https://t.co/1e7nzN0P0O
At least 44 million Americans have no choice but to use insecure voting machines that have foreign hackers salivating. Americans must move to paper ballots, marked by hand. Until that system is adopted, every election that goes by is an election that Russia could hack.
I testified at the Senate Rules Committee this morning to call on the Senate to pass my Protecting American Votes and Elections Act, which requires paper ballots and effective audits for ALL federal elections.
🚨 To secure our elections against foreign hackers, we must have paper ballots and audits. It is inexcusable that American democracy depends on hackable voting machines and technology made by a handful of companies that have evaded oversight and stonewalled Congress. https://t.co/UH0CqnYLu5
.@realDonaldTrump, talk is cheap. Drug prices are not. It’s time for real action - NOT theatrics.
.@realDonaldTrump must prove that Pfizer’s announcement is more than theatrics. The American people deserve real change for lower prices at the pharmacy counter. 
https://t.co/SOkzCILlJa
Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America’s drug pricing system is broken. Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points while Pharma cos continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits. https://t.co/x4b299fG73
Trump’s health care sabotage crusade is making it harder and harder for families to afford quality insurance that isn’t filled with loopholes and exceptions that benefit insurance companies.
Trump wants groups to sell unsuspecting Americans on #junkplans that allow insurance companies to deny care on a whim and charge whatever they want. Nothing but a SCAM.
.@CMSgov is cutting the #ACA navigator program. Worse yet, Trump is requiring them to push #junkplans. That's federally-funded fraud.
We will NOT return to the days when health care was only for the healthy &amp; wealthy. Democrats &amp; concerned Americans across the country will not stand down without a fight. #WhatsAtStake
Americans would face the prospect of “job lock” – developing a condition while at a job, &amp; being stuck there because a new employer couldn't cover their preexisting condition at any cost.
Kavanaugh on #SCOTUS would mark an end to protections that ensure employers cover core benefits like prescription drugs, maternity care or pediatric services.
Kavanaugh on #SCOTUS means a return to the days when employers could prevent you from getting health care for months, or leave care for your preexisting condition uncovered. #ProtectOurCare #WhatsAtStake
The 167 million Americans with employer sponsored health insurance will also lose the #ACA’s airtight, loophole-free preexisting condition protections. #WhatsAtStake
If the Senate doesn’t stand up to #StopSCOTUS, @realDonaldTrump will succeed at ripping away preexisting condition protections that affect 130 MILLION people. #WhatsAtStake

Benczkowski isn’t remotely qualified for the job. He has never tried a criminal case. And on the flip side, he represented a major Russian bank.

As the son of a reporter, I learned early on about the importance of the freedom of the press. And as the child of parents who fled the Nazis, I also learned early on about the importance of the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly. #FirstAmendmentWyden

China’s unfair, disruptive trade tactics are an assault against American workers and American innovation. Workers need results. If today’s action marks the beginning of a coherent strategy that produces real change in China, I welcome it.
Huge congrats to @OregonState for earning this opportunity from the @NSF to build this key addition to our country’s academic research fleet. https://t.co/nsNu2cgJRB
Congress must take action and pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to stop the Trump administration’s inhumane policy of separating families. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/y6lNZ26im2
Children belong with their families, NOT in detention centers or tent cities. Separating families at the border runs counter to our American and humanitarian values. This is not who we are as Americans. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Inhumane and cruel - @realDonaldTrump administration’s treatment of innocent children who’ve been torn from their parents’ arms only succeeds in further traumatizing them. #FamiliesBelongTogether

We must protect Medicaid access. Oregon’s rural communities depend on it. In Wallowa County’s 7,000 person population, nearly 2,000 rely on Medicaid, many gaining coverage thanks to Oregon’s #MedicaidExpansion. #OregonWay
After my Wallowa County town hall last month, I met w/ Dr. Elizabeth Powers, a family physician at Winding Waters, about the impact of #MedicaidExpansion in Eastern OR &amp; how #CommunityHealthCenters &amp; preventative care have helped residents achieve their health goals. #OregonWay https://t.co/rYKG4S0oJo
This is astounding. @FERC commissioner told me that @SecretaryPerry’s proposal would raise energy rates between $32 BILLION and $65 BILLION total. That's $250 - $500 per family without a single added benefit. https://t.co/Nc3HYbanOH
Don’t take it from me. Number crunchers confirm Trump’s campaign of sabotage is driving up your premiums. https://t.co/EM4kz3QSwV
Americans deserve a health care system that works for everybody – not just the healthy and wealthy. Trump and his Republican allies appear to believe otherwise.
The Trump admin wants to roll back the clock: First, they tried to eliminate the Medicaid guarantee &amp; hurt seniors. Then they opened the door to #junkplans. Now, they want to let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions ranging from ovarian cancer to asthma.
@realDonaldTrump After Republicans failed to pass #Trumpcare through Congress, they’ve been looking for any possible way to subvert the will of the American public, who stood up and spoke out against their regressive plans.
When @realDonaldTrump and his Justice Department abandoned their duty to defend the law of the land, they put the health care of 130 million Americans with a pre-existing condition at risk. It’s another example of Trump’s health care agenda of discrimination. https://t.co/Xl5rYRY3AK

My bipartisan #HempFarmingAct w/ @SenateMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley and @RandPaul will help farmers unlock the full economic potential of industrial hemp, spurring economic growth and creating good-paying red, white, and blue jobs in rural communities across the country.

Americans with pre-existing conditions already struggle with periods of uninsurance. @realDonaldTrump wants to make it even harder for them to get the care they need and deserve. https://t.co/rITHX3zSvc

.@realDonaldTrump can’t just deny detainees their rights to legal counsel or to talk with their families. That’s why I am working with my colleagues in the Oregon delegation to fight back: https://t.co/u6lhOiqiNT
Leaving the fate of America’s democracy up to hackable election machines is like leaving your front door open, unlocked and putting up a sign that says ‘out of town.’ It’s not a question of if bad guys get in, it’s just a question of when.
For Americans to have confidence that their votes count, and that election results are free and fair, there absolutely have to be paper ballots and mandatory audits for each and every federal election.
I’m proud @SenGillibrand, @SenMarkey, @SenJeffMerkley, @PattyMurray and @SenWarren are joining in introducing legislation to require state and local governments to take basic steps to secure elections from hackers, &amp; ensure every American’s vote counts.
Russia’s attack on our democracy in 2016 was the last straw – Congress must act immediately to protect our democracy from cyberattacks. I’ve introduced the Protecting American Votes &amp; Elections Act to mandate paper ballots &amp; risk-limiting audits in all federal elections.

I fought this proposal before and I will continue to fight this corrupt scheme to bail out coal barons and swindle American families.
Oregon has a 50% target for renewable power by 2040, and our utilities are working with the state to make it happen. That is what the future should look like.
The Trump admin is reaching into Americans’ pocketbooks only to hand that hard-earned money to mismanaged utilities and uncompetitive coal companies, many of whom are Trump donors.
The Trump administration’s commonsense-defying plan will raise utility rates for consumers from $30 billion to $65 billion - The average family will pay between $250 - $500 more per year for NOTHING, because this plan will not make the grid more secure or more reliable.
.@SecretaryPerry &amp; @realDonaldTrump are propping up their coal cronies at the expense of American families. Their absurd, unnecessary scheme to subsidize uncompetitive coal plants will raise your electric bill by $250 - $500 a year. https://t.co/UWS4LacGdf

@realDonaldTrump @FCC To #SaveTheInternet, the Senate passed a resolution to protect #NetNeutrality and give communities, students and businesses equal access to information.
Today, @realdonaldtrump’s @FCC new rules go into effect, ending a free &amp; open internet by allowing the creation of fast lanes for the wealthy and slow lanes for the rest of us. #SaveTheInternet

@SenJeffMerkley @RandPaul Today, more than a quarter of the Senate – Democrats &amp; Republicans – have signed on to our #HempFarmingAct to end this brainless, anti-farmer, anti-American jobs policy. Momentum is growing, and I am not going to stop looking for every opportunity to make progress on this issue.
Hemp is a HUGE opportunity for American farmers and red, white and blue jobs – which is why @LeaderMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley, @RandPaul &amp; I intro’d the #HempFarmingAct in April – the latest version of legislation I’ve intro’d every Congress since 2012. #HempWeek
Hemp = The only Schedule I controlled substance you can sew into a tee shirt and wear through TSA. #HempWeek
Hemp = NOT a drug. Having one too many hemp granola bars might give you a stomach ache, but it won’t put you in the hospital. It defies common sense that our laws consider hemp to be as dangerous and addictive as meth. #HempWeek
Hemp products make up a $1 BILLION industry in the U.S. - Hemp growers in Canada and China are laughing their way to the bank, while hemp farmers at home have their hands tied with restrictions on growing this Schedule I controlled substance. #HempWeek
Products made with hemp are perfectly legal, but growing industrial hemp is a federal crime. It’s simple - If you can buy hemp products in a supermarket in America, farmers should be able to grow it in America. #HempWeek https://t.co/HSWLpgkNKN
Happy #HempWeek! I’m headed to the Senate floor to speak in celebration of #HempHistoryWeek and to encourage my Senate colleagues to end the anti-farming restrictions on growing industrial hemp.

To date, the Trump admin appears to be pursuing a trade policy that creates economic chaos and uncertainty rather than jobs for hard working Americans.

Trump needs to stop lobbying for payoffs to Big Oil executives and focus on helping regular Americans – starting by urging the OPEC oil cartel to stop inflating gas prices.
.@realdonaldtrump’s reckless decision to break our deal with Iran has only added to the spike in oil prices, and created massive uncertainty in oil markets that translates to more pain at the pump for drivers.
Any tax benefit working families might have seen from Trump’s law will be wiped clean by the rise in gas prices.
7 of the largest Big Oil companies announced $13 billion in stock buybacks after Trump signed his #TrumpTax bill into law. These schemes fatten the wallets of wealthy CEOs &amp; shareholders worldwide - NOT working Americans.
🚨 Since @realDonaldTrump took the wheel, he’s driven gas prices in one direction – straight up. Gas prices have risen more than 25% since Trump took office, hitting an average of nearly $3 a gallon nationwide.

@realDonaldTrump Since 2010, 83 rural hospitals have closed services, and hundreds more are in dire conditions. We must prevent rural America from turning into that sacrifice zone where people can’t get the care they need.
@realDonaldTrump Rural areas feel like their local hospitals are already teetering on the brink of closing their doors. If they lose their local hospital, the emergency department goes with it.
Rural communities feel like there’s a wrecking ball headed their way because the @realDonaldTrump, his admin &amp; Congressional Republicans have spent the last 15 months desperately trying to make huge cuts to Medicaid - a lifeline for rural hospitals and patients.
When I hold open-to-all town hall meetings in every rural Oregon county, I meet with many leaders from the rural health care community and Oregonians who depend on quality care.
The #TrumpTax has Harley-Davidson shareholders riding all the way to the bank – at the expense of its workers and their communities. https://t.co/GBVtBTndYn

I’m proud to announce with my @SenateFinance colleagues 22 bipartisan Medicare, Medicaid and Human Services bills that take a significant step forward in finding a lasting fix.
Congress must take real and lasting action to confront the growing opioid epidemic that’s devastated far too many people and their loved ones in Oregon and across the country.
@realDonaldTrump This is an attack on @PPFA &amp; an attack on vital sources of care for women. Women could lose access to the doctors they trust &amp; to life-saving services like cancer screenings, routine physicals, as well as birth control &amp; prenatal care.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans in Congress used to talk about “patient-centered care.” What they really put into action is politics-centered care.
Limiting health care choices for women is wrong. @realDonaldTrump’s administration is putting itself right in the middle of women and their doctors, denying access to critical information millions of women rely on from the physicians and providers they trust. https://t.co/QCtO5fJiwO
When so many Oregonians can’t afford a roof over their heads, our entire community suffers. With rent &amp; housing costs soaring in OR, this much-needed public housing funding will help ensure the availability of this basic necessity all Oregonians deserve. https://t.co/IX1rEBezZY
@realDonaldTrump The bottom line - A woman’s ability to access the health care she deserves and make informed decisions about her body should be an unimpeachable right. We must fight against this attack on women’s health care.
.@realDonaldTrump wants to put the government in charge of what conversations doctors can have with their patients and which health care services women can receive - That’s as ‘Big Brother’ as it gets.
@SenateFinance Stock buyback schemes boost CEO pay by inflating stock prices – but Big Oil execs on this stock buyback spree are already out-earning their average employees by up to 935 times.
@SenateFinance Since Trump signed his tax law, 7 of the biggest oil companies have announced stock buybacks totaling $13 BILLION. https://t.co/MmF8TOeIGE
@SenateFinance Big Oil CEOs are funneling their #TrumpTax cuts into BILLIONS of dollars into stock buybacks. Oil execs and foreign shareholders are raking in these big benefits while working families watch prices at the pump skyrocket.
@SenateFinance By giving corporations a permanent tax cut, the #TrumpTax is giving Big Oil major tax windfalls year after year. Over the next decade, 4 of the biggest oil companies are estimated to rake in nearly $15 BILLION in tax benefits.
.@SenateFinance staff analyzed Big Oil earnings calls and financial documents that exposed how #TrumpTax set up Big Oil to rake in billions and billions of dollars in tax benefits over the next decade. https://t.co/MmF8TOeIGE
@USDOL Diversity of skills &amp; backgrounds is what makes our country a powerhouse of innovation. This draft legislation is an important first step toward helping businesses harness the immense brainpower, talent and economic potential the American workforce has to offer.
@USDOL My draft ELEVATE Act will help workers access on-the-job training and support services like child care &amp; transportation, allowing more workers to succeed and stay on the job, helping their families, their employers &amp; their communities thrive. https://t.co/twvvReR8Hr
According to @USDOL, there’s a job opening for every American who needs work. The reality is that folks who are out of work want a job. But more needs to be done to connect Americans to good-paying jobs &amp; help everyone climb the economic ladder.
Unemployment is at a post-recession low, but there’s still a huge gap between current job openings &amp; workers needing good jobs. I’m announcing a proposal to fund employment programs to narrow the workforce gap and help more Americans find work &amp; support. https://t.co/342fnZurAI
It's high time for the government to drop this misguided effort, which will only make Americans less safe from criminals, hackers and predators. 
https://t.co/Q1PEq0J2Uw

What do Americans get in return for @realDonaldTrump saving Chinese jobs at ZTE? https://t.co/AxIgoJkWQ3
After months of fruitless trade negotiations, it’s stunning to see how rapidly the Trump administration sprang into action to save these jobs at ZTE, a Chinese firm that schemed to use shell companies to violate our sanctions on Iran &amp; North Korea. https://t.co/uBT2wbd42B
While the #TrumpTax is filling the pockets of Big Oil execs, Oregonians are facing some of the country’s highest gas prices. Hardworking families are forced to pinch pennies. https://t.co/AncO7KOzuy
Americans are seeing gas prices skyrocket under the #TrumpTax. On top of that, @realDonaldTrump's decision to withdraw from the #IranNuclearDeal has American families paying even more at the pump: https://t.co/o5rtW2QqkJ

When I see the students and young people who organized the March for Our Lives in our nation’s capital, in Oregon and across the country, I see the spirit of those Thurston youngsters violently stolen from their families and loved ones. https://t.co/4Kw0SZsxuE
Congress must push back against special interests that have blocked every reasonable effort to protect our children and communities from gun violence. Congress must finally honor the lives lost by passing commonsense gun laws.
Today I’m remembering the shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, 20 years ago. The horrific epidemic of gun violence in our schools rips away the lives of children and teachers, forever wounding the body and spirit of entire communities which never truly heal.
That said, Dana Baiocco’s nomination is one more in a pattern. When a consumer protection job comes open, the Trump administration fills it with a corporate swamp creature who has actively opposed the protection of consumers. I’m voting NO on her nomination tonight.
.@USCPSC is consumer protection 101. For example: making sure the toys toddlers put in their mouths aren’t covered in poison. Somehow the Trump administration found a way, with this nominee, to put itself on the wrong side of the poisoning children “debate.”
Dana Baiocco defended a company that sold dangerous children’s toys containing lead paint. Now she’s the Trump administration’s nominee to regulate … wait for it … *THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN’S TOYS* as a @USCPSC commissioner. https://t.co/b7lR6FFGB5

@realDonaldTrump It’s time for Congress to do some real bipartisan oversight. We need to pin down any connection between these conflicts and Trump going soft on China.

Until China actually agrees to action helping American workers and there’s evidence of follow through, I’ll keep pushing for the fundamental reforms creating more high-skill, high-wage jobs for American workers.
After all the tough-guy rhetoric, the Trump admin is getting rolled on trade with China. Last year, this admin thought it had a meaningful deal with China, but it delivered little more than broken promises. @realDonaldTrump, it’s not mission accomplished.

The fight isn't over to protect food assistance for the 1 in 8 Americans who relies on SNAP. I remain committed to protecting this essential food assistance program that millions of Americans are counting on &amp; will do all I can to ensure it is available for those who need it.
The #GOPFarmBill would have made it harder for families to access SNAP benefits by implementing burdensome paperwork requirements, while states would be left footing the bill to create new standards to evaluate SNAP participants.
Good news for children &amp; families in Oregon &amp; across the country: the #GOPFarmBill failed today in the House. This bill threatened to take vital food assistance away from millions of Americans who are working hard just to get by.
Trump seems to think Big Pharma will magically lower their prices for American consumers if other countries pay more. If Trump’s tax law is any indication, those profits are going right back to Pharma’s worldwide shareholders while U.S. families keep paying more and more. https://t.co/hvSIGTWiC1
The Trump administration wants to gut funding for lifesaving health care services that millions of women rely on. Telling women what kind of care and information they can and can’t receive is Trump’s agenda of health care discrimination on full display. https://t.co/TUCS5fC6BO

A hacker could have used this site to know when you were in your house so they would know when to rob it.  A predator could have tracked your child’s cell phone to know when they were alone.
Wireless carriers and LocationSmart appear to have allowed nearly any hacker with a basic knowledge of websites to track the location of any American with a cell phone. They value profits over privacy.
This leak, only days after the lax security at Securus was exposed, shows how little companies throughout the wireless ecosystem value Americans’ security. https://t.co/CaxtI7MUl4

There is much more that the full Senate and the public should know about Haspel’s background, and I am convinced that, if they did, her nomination would be rejected.
In our democracy, confirmations are not supposed to take place in secret. Nominees do not get to decide what is and isn’t known about them. With Haspel’s nomination, these principles have been thrown out the window.
Gina Haspel and the @CIA have conducted an unprecedented and entirely self-serving cover-up, and the U.S. Senate has been a willing partner. I’m voting NO on Haspel’s confirmation to be CIA director.
.@CIA nominee Gina Haspel is exercising unprecedented power to personally censor any facts that might get in the way of her confirmation. I’m speaking out on the Senate floor against the CIA’s A – Z cover-up: https://t.co/N0fCE9KZgr
Anyone who voted AGAINST this #NetNeutrality resolution voted FOR Big Cable and AGAINST the American public. They voted in favor of higher prices for streaming services like Netflix &amp; Hulu, squeezing every last dollar they can out of consumers, while Big Cable cashes in.
I was the first to introduce #NetNeutrality legislation in the Senate, over a decade ago, and I’m committed to fighting for telecommunications policies rooted in openness, non-discrimination, and freedom online.
Voting to protect #NetNeutrality is the biggest win for the Internet since beating PIPA SOPA. I’ve spent my career fighting for a free and open internet, because I believe that EVERYONE should have fair &amp; equal access to information. #RonReport https://t.co/V7Q0SYyHIj
The temporary tax breaks for craft beverage job creators will not be repealed by Democrats. Republicans are playing politics with a provision they chose to write in disappearing ink.
My bill has overwhelming support in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle. It would make reductions in excise tax burdens for the beverage industry last.
https://t.co/mbewavpFS3
The bitter truth – #TrumpTax abandoned my bipartisan bill that gave permanent tax breaks to distillers, brewers and vintners – making it more difficult for #smallbiz to make new hires and make new investments they need to thrive.
The American people just scored a BIG victory in the fight to protect real #NetNeutrality and stop Big Cable. Now it’s time for the House to listen to the American people and pass this resolution to #SaveNetNeutrality.
This is beyond absurd. It’s vital that Bolton and @realDonaldTrump retain a dedicated cyber advisor to ensure that our nation, critical infrastructure, and economy are protected from the ever-growing cyber-attacks on the U.S.

Since I became the first Senator to introduce net neutrality legislation more than a decade ago, I’ve fought for open, free &amp; transparent telecommunications policies. The Senate must do the right thing to protect consumers &amp; #smallbiz by voting to save #NetNeutrality
Oregonians know what’s at stake in this fight. Ending #NetNeutrality = snail’s pace internet, rural business will have a harder time getting off the ground &amp; rural health care providers miss out on lifesaving technological marvels.
If Senate Republicans let the Trump admin to get away with ending #NetNeutrality, Americans will be charged more for their Netflix &amp; Hulu subscriptions and music services. The Trump FCC is handing Big Cable more money and power.
This Senate vote on #NetNeutrality will have the biggest direct impact on Americans’ wallets than any other vote in 2018. @realDonaldTrump and @AjitpaiFCC want to end our free and open internet. https://t.co/ydO0ZQAcUa

No one should have to choose between putting food on the table &amp; accessing lifesaving treatment for an illness. While the Trump administration refuses to take real action, I’m ready to work on a bipartisan basis to make good on Trump’s promise to lower drug prices.
Drug companies continue to funnel their massive tax windfall from Trump’s tax law into tens of billions of dollars in stock buybacks for their wealthy shareholders, including those overseas, instead of lowering drug prices for families here at home.
The execs in pharmaceutical board rooms across the country are breathing a sigh of relief today - @realDonaldTrump still isn’t delivering on his promise to make prescription drugs more affordable.

There is still an urgent need for more low-income housing options. Oregon is stronger and more prosperous when everyone has a safe place to call home. #OurHomesOurVoices
In March, Congress expanded the low-income housing tax credit, so more Oregonians will now be able to have a roof over their heads. This legislation is expected to create 35,000 new affordable housing units and 40,000 jobs across the U.S.
No one should have to decide between paying rent or putting food on the table. That’s unacceptable. #CutsHurt #OurHomesOurVoices
Ryan Bounds misled the independent committee that considers potential nominees in Oregon by withholding inflammatory writings revealing disturbing views on sexual assault and the treatment of vulnerable people. https://t.co/Dti4i5c8fY

Congrats, @UO_MNCH! As a proud @uoregon alum and son of a librarian, I know firsthand how valuable libraries are to our state. They enrich our communities and encourage a commitment to higher learning for people of all ages. #GoDucks https://t.co/yzMKAIUp5I
#ListeningToTheFuture today at Baker High School in Eastern Oregon, I heard fantastic feedback at the  #2018townhall from students and adults in Baker County about ways to build on the strength of our state’s rural counties and create more jobs https://t.co/8z5mtobQNt
Looks like former Trump @HHSGov Secretary Tom Price agrees with @SenRubioPress. The #TrumpTax is bad for your wallet and your health.

Great #ListeningToTheFuture conversation at this morning’s #2018townhall in Grant County about rural jobs, civil liberties, vote-by-mail, healthcare, gun violence and more with the smart Prairie City students &amp; the entire community. https://t.co/xCdWSJ5JrP
Prairie City felt like #RipCity this morning talking hoops with these students after my #2018townhall about the #NBAplayoffs and the prospects for the @Trailblazers next year. https://t.co/xL6S4ZQ3ta
So far in 2018, $290 BILLION in share buybacks have been announced, benefitting executives and wealthy shareholders. That's over 40 times greater than the one-time bonuses and wage hikes paid out to employees.
Yes, @SenRubioPress, corporations and wealthy shareholders are raking in benefits from the #TrumpTax - at the expense of workers and Main Street. https://t.co/lk1cvq0SSx
Proud to sign the petition to force a vote to #SaveNetNeutrality. #OneMoreVote https://t.co/XwkZkEgr7E
More people are without health insurance for the first time since 2014 after a year of GOP’s reckless political games with Americans’ health care. So much for @realdonaldtrump’s promise of “insurance for everybody.” https://t.co/iHLlNwI1xJ

Coming a few days before World Press Freedom Day, the attack in Kabul that killed journalists and others this morning is another sad reminder of the extraordinary risks many reporters take to cover war, corruption and dangerous parts of the world.
In Burns for today’s Harney County #2018townhall, I heard great #OregonWay questions from students &amp; adults about veterans, education, healthcare, gun violence, net neutrality, agriculture, Syria &amp; more. #ListeningToTheFuture. https://t.co/uhStSP0Ywx
A good summary by @1110KBND of my recent central Oregon fire briefing in Bend — specifically that weather in the next few weeks in May &amp; June will dictate the severity of the fire season ahead:

Today’s Marion County #2018townhall in Salem represented the best of the #OregonWay w/ a 90-minute conversation where no topic was off limits and the emphasis was on solutions for healthcare, campaign finance &amp; transportation. Thanks to all who came https://t.co/yXDGPm09XU

Thanks Washington County for today’s fantastic 
#2018townhall conversation about DREAMers, gun violence, homelessness, vote-by-mail &amp; more. This was my 888th Oregon town hall — these meetings are a huge part of what I call the #OregonWay focused on solutions. https://t.co/JGmLZlH44z
Really enjoyed #Listeningtothefuture at Sisters HS yesterday hosted by these four dynamic students that I met when they came to DC #MarchForOurLives
Thanks @townhallproject. Looking forward very much to lots of conversations with Oregonians all over the state in the days ahead at a #2018townhall. Here is my schedule: https://t.co/3cGcudbITA https://t.co/2EbUfrR8kV

After today’s @CentralORFire wildfire briefing, I am even more gratified to have worked on a bipartisan basis to pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act that improves fire prevention and more: https://t.co/jPsJVbSsML

It’s time to put the power back into the hands of working Americans rather than allow companies to keep workers stuck in jobs that don’t provide a competitive wage. https://t.co/iuaWFUSz3H
Proud to introduce the Workforce Mobility Act w/ Senator Murphy &amp; @SenWarren to allow workers the freedom to seek higher wages using the experience they’ve gained, without fear of legal action from their employers.

I voted NO on Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State. He has demonstrated a casual relationship to both the truth and principle. He doesn’t have the character or judgment to serve as America’s top diplomat.
It is unacceptable that @ENERGY and its private contractor can’t ensure that the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant is safe. https://t.co/d3Zo7Cov40
The ban on gun violence research began with the passage of the 1996 Dickey Amendment. Honest, unbiased and scientific research is critical to creating policies that prevent gun violence, including mass shootings and suicides. https://t.co/GC9xg2j4tU
Congress ended the ban on life-saving research on gun violence at the @CDCgov and gave the agency $10 million a year for that research – but they’ve yet to start. NOW is the time for the CDC director to begin treating gun violence like the public health crisis it is.
Attacks on campaign finance laws are why I’ve cosponsored legislation to create a constitutional amendment allowing Congress and the States to regulate and restore faith in our campaign finance laws. #WebofDeceit

#JunkPlans are “short term” health care plans with long term consequences. Insurance companies can once again discriminate by age, charge more, and leave important benefits uncovered.

@SenateFinance #SmallBiz owners are facing many challenges with #TrumpTax – They’re in the dark about what they’re going to owe this year under the new rules. What happened to Trump’s promise of simplifying the tax code?
@SenateFinance The #TrumpTax has done little for people who work hard to earn a wage. Where are the workers’ promised $4,000 wage increases?
The ink on the #TrumpTax is barely dry, but already there are calls for a SECOND round of tax cuts. Republicans in Congress should think twice about big new promises if they can’t deliver on the ones they’ve already made. @SenateFinance: https://t.co/BNfNE6XvQV

We must #ProtectOurCoast from catastrophic oil spills. I’ve signed on to the #CleanCoastsAct to implement safety recommendations created after the BP oil spill – the largest offshore oil spill disaster in U.S. history.
Oregonians don’t want to see oil derricks on the horizon when we look at Haystack Rock. Opening our coast to drilling would threaten coastal economies &amp; go against the wishes of local communities. #ProtectOurCoast
@MikeCrapo @forestservice At today’s @EnergyDems hearing, I asked for a game plan for how the @ForestService will use our bipartisan wildfire funding fix to get back to work in the woods.
My bipartisan wildfire funding solution w/@MikeCrapo liberates funding at the @ForestService for much-needed wildfire prevention work. This isn’t a blank check. The @ForestService needs to start immediately getting ahead of infernos threatening our communities. https://t.co/eExXim0TbV
#TrumpTax promised $4,000 to every wage worker, but that hasn’t happened. Republicans in Congress should keep their old promises before they make new ones.

4 out of 10 working-age Americans suffering from opioid addiction rely on Medicaid. As the largest source of funding for treatment in the country, Medicaid is a key part of a solution to the opioid epidemic. Right now, Congress has an opportunity to take bipartisan action.
In 2015, more than 52,000 Americans died of a drug overdose. In 2016 - 64,000. In 2017 - 71,000. I’ve heard powerful and agonizing stories from parents in Oregon who’ve lost children to the opioid epidemic.
Opioid (or drug) manufacturers have misled the country about the dangers of opioids. Opioid executives have avoided the spotlight congress put on big tobacco executives.
It’s long past time @SenateFinance holds opioid executives accountable for their role in creating a public health calamity that’s killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. https://t.co/GwmOr744gH
.@SenateFinance is holding a hearing on opioid and substance use disorders in Medicare and Medicaid. People deserve to hear answers about what Congress and the Trump Administration are doing about this public health calamity. Watch LIVE: https://t.co/g8JrgsT5AU

@SenRubioPress U.S. taxpayers deserve a return on their investment in the form of better encryption technology and enhanced privacy protections. #SecureMPC

I’m not going to stop working to end the outdated, misunderstood federal ban on growing industrial hemp. I’m calling on Congress to join us. #HempFarmingAct
Here’s my bottom line on hemp ➡️ If you can BUY it in a supermarket in America, farmers should be allowed to GROW it in America. #HempFarmingAct
The market for hemp products is nearing $1 BILLION. The federal government’s misguided policy means that hemp has to be imported. Hemp products on supermarket shelves today can never be considered fully American-made.
Federal law treats hemp like it’s a dangerous drug, but the only thing you’re going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting breath, time and lighter fluid.
Today, I introduced legislation co-sponsored by @SenateMajLdr, @SenJeffMerkley and @RandPaul to end the anti-farmer, anti-consumer, anti-common sense ban on growing industrial hemp in America: The #HempFarmingAct. https://t.co/YwUlLL3xeG

@SenateBudget This week @USCBO projected the federal deficit will rise to $804 billion in 2018. This will only embolden @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans in Congress to cut heath care &amp; earned benefits seniors were promised.

Last #EqualPayDay, I joined my colleagues in reintroducing the #PaycheckFairnessAct. Women should be able to hold their employers accountable for not paying a fair wage. Congress must pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct NOW.

Thinking of my mother a lot today, on both #EqualPayDay &amp; #NLWD18. She was a librarian who worked just as hard as her male colleagues but always seemed to be paid less. Gender should never shortchange how much you get paid to do your job. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/0E2W08fDwW

Kudos to Union County for the #OregonWay solutions-focused discussion at this afternoon’s #2018townhall at @eoumountaineers in La Grande. Covered #DACA, wildfires, healthcare, Russia investigation, protecting public lands &amp; much more. https://t.co/xRPQCacqmI
Learned a lot about robotics from the smart @umatillaschools students I met today. Parents, teachers and entire Umatilla community should be very proud of these fantastic kids. #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/A4GfYwmUaF
Thanks @Umatillaschools students &amp; all of Umatilla County for today’s outstanding #2018townhall discussion about veterans, #DACA, education, rural economy, and stopping gun violence in schools. #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/ho7CTrCZcS
As millions of Americans file their taxes, @realDonaldTrump won't release his - unlike every president since Watergate.
It’d be helpful to everyone with a 401k if @realDonaldTrump didn’t tweet every little thought that flitted into his head.
Very impressed by students’ questions today about net neutrality, gun violence, college affordability, #DACA and more at Condon High School at my Gilliam County #2018townhall.  #ListeningToTheFuture https://t.co/kReybcbW9E
Thanks Gilliam County for such a wonderful #2018townhall in Condon. Great conversation about wildfires, rural economy, healthcare &amp; keeping down the cost of prescription drug prices. https://t.co/7cOwdCxpiY
My first town hall was in Wheeler County, and it was great to be back for today’s #2018townhall in Fossil — my 882nd townhall overall in Oregon. Happy to report the #OregonWay spirit of participatory democracy is thriving. https://t.co/JEnZeV3ucR
Here’s my #2018townhall schedule for today, Tuesday and Wednesday in Wheeler, Gilliam, Umatilla, Union, Morrow and Sherman counties: https://t.co/3cGcudbITA
Wealthy and powerful corporate executives are boosting their bank accounts with stock buybacks – while laying off American workers. The #TrumpTax does not lead to red-white-and-blue jobs. https://t.co/cVpSpH2Cpb https://t.co/NYJfDyDOPb
Here’s how the right mix of “pulling, pushing and prodding” produced a common-sense fix that will help in the fight to battle wildfires better &amp; smarter: https://t.co/0G3RH9CBp6
.@realDonaldTrump promised not to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Cutting these valuable services is another Republican broken promise.
🚨 #TrumpTax was only the beginning. After giving massive tax giveaways to wealthy &amp; powerful shareholders, Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
https://t.co/9YTuAYnOWw
The fight to #ProtectOurCare isn’t over. Right now, Republicans in Congress are coming for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security: https://t.co/9YTuAYnOWw https://t.co/2n8zapoFqi
I'm requesting further information from the @NRA after the organization admitted to accepting foreign contributions. https://t.co/pTd4leBbDB
The @NRA acknowledged in a letter to me on March 19 that it maintains accounts with foreign donations that could fund political activities intended to sway the American political debate and influence campaigns. https://t.co/LtwO27VyL9
The fight to stop gun violence and school massacres doesn’t end with this weekend’s #MarchForOurLives. Students and young people are just getting started - I’ll be right there with them. https://t.co/GgcahZqbOT
Oregon young people are leading the way on political change – great story about Mt. Tabor Middle School students fighting to save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/8k5hHBECTK
Southern Oregon high school students are saying #NeverAgain at #MarchForOurLives in Medford. https://t.co/w8FuLM3AbX
I’m inspired by the #MarchForOurLives in Salem. https://t.co/sjGmTbilKe
I’m amazed by the people power at #MarchForOurLives in Oregon and across the country. By speaking out and getting loud, the American people will make a difference. #NeverAgain

Trump barrels ahead with reckless, bigoted transgender ban, despite criticism from many military leaders.  I will oppose his ban. https://t.co/16vVBZu4BF
Too many working families in Oregon struggle to find affordable, high-quality child care. I’m happy the bipartisan omnibus spending bill includes the biggest child care increase in history to address our child care crisis. #ChildCare4all #ChildCareNow
Instead of taking our country back to the days when health care was reserved for the healthy and wealthy, @realDonaldTrump should be working with Congress to lower families’ costs and secure bedrock consumer protections.
The consequences of @realDonaldTrump &amp; congressional Republicans’ sustained attacks on Americans’ health care will be higher premiums, the return of junk insurance, &amp; an agenda of discrimination against vulnerable Americans.
Today - on the 8th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, the Trump admin is doing everything in its power to make the @realDonaldTrump’s proclamation that ‘Obamacare is dead’ come true.
The ACA was created to increase access and affordability for all Americans – including the @LittleLobbyists. I’m amazed by their stories and courage. https://t.co/jH28bjFHfq
This is a long-overdue, bipartisan solution to the madness of 'fire borrowing' and will finally treat these infernos like the natural disasters they are. Millions of dollars will now be liberated each year for essential wildfire prevention.
https://t.co/fkhaQxiVYV
Fire seasons are getting longer and more expensive to fight. Our bipartisan provision fixes how the Forest Service pays to fight historic forest fires that devastate homes and communities in Oregon and the West.
https://t.co/NQjpyddGLy
The fight against record-breaking wildfires just got a heavy dose of common sense thanks to a provision in the omnibus government funding bill I co-wrote with Senator @MikeCrapo. #RonReport https://t.co/wM8ZsQZdNY
The last thing our country needs is another belligerent ideologue beating a constant drum of war.
Between this appointment &amp; the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State, @realDonaldTrump isn't even trying to pretend the that era of sending American troops into endless foreign conflicts is over.
John Bolton's answer to seemingly every foreign policy crisis is war.  He supported the catastrophic invasion of Iraq in 2003 and continues to publicly call for first strikes on Iran and North Korea.
I’ve renewed my call for paper ballots and mandatory audits after @DHSgov @SecNielsen said that paperless voting machines pose “a national security concern” at yesterday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. https://t.co/IWNXs46dfX
Today we take a real step backward, backward, and down a path we will regret.
We are in a fight for the Internet every day. Big Internet companies are NOT engaged in this fight - Their only interest is currying favor with the nations where they wish to do business.
My amendment gives the right people the resources they need to bring these monsters to justice.
I’m offering an amendment that provides $20 million a year for 5 years to the Attorney General to spend in coordination with the FBI &amp; Homeland Security to investigate and prosecute sites that criminally facilitate sex trafficking.
The #SESTA #FOSTA bill before us today will not stop sex trafficking. It will not prevent young people from becoming victims. The #SESTA #FOSTA bill before the Senate will punch a hole in the legal framework of the open internet.
I have authored laws to support victims and provide ongoing funding paid for by those convicted of crimes against children, and I’ve authored laws to improve the child welfare system to help prevent children from becoming victims in the first place.
I take a backseat to NOBODY when it comes to policies that bring sex traffickers to justice and help the victims of their hideous crimes.
The #FOSTA #SESTA legislation before the Senate will prove to be ineffective, it will have harmful unintended consequences, and it could be ruled unconstitutional.
In fighting sex trafficking, our country has failed victims on almost EVERY level. Following on the failures of federal law enforcement &amp; big internet companies, the Congress is responding to a serious challenge with flawed policy changes w/ #SESTA.
@facebook @YouTube @tumblr There was a time when the biggest internet companies had mottos like “don’t be evil.” It’s time for them to aspire to a more modest motto, “don’t spread evil.”
Websites like @Facebook, @YouTube &amp; @tumblr have an undeniable role to play in fostering a civil environment.
Far too often, the big internet companies refuse to recognize content to take down even when they see it.
Big tech companies have become bloated &amp; uninterested in the larger good. They’ve made it easy for the creators of vile content to move from one platform to another.
#Section230 is on the verge of collapse because the big internet companies have utterly failed to live up to the responsibility they were handed two decades ago.
@CatoInstitute @HRC @ACLU Without #Section230’S protections, civic organizations exercising their right to free speech could be silenced by their more powerful political opponents.
.@CatoInstitute, @HRC &amp; @ACLU have voiced concerns about #SESTA in its current form because #Section230 protects the coordination of free speech.
Without #Section 230, the internet as we know it would shrivel. ONLY those platforms run by people with deep pockets and a deeper bench of lawyers would make it.
With #Section230, our economy has grown by trillions of dollars because the government got this policy right from the beginning -- just as internet-based commerce was preparing to take flight.
Thanks to #Section230, marginalized groups of vulnerable Americans have a better opportunity than ever to make their voices heard – And small nonprofits have the ability to take their causes nationwide.
I co-wrote #Section230 to create the Internet’s rules-of-the-road. As a result, a small, gutsy entrepreneur with a big dream working out of his garage has a real shot to succeed.
Now I'm turning it over to my staff.
I fear the current bill will be another failure, I’m speaking out on the Senate floor about why #SESTA #FOSTA will do more harm than good for preventing sex trafficking: https://t.co/qHuupI9iKk
Federal law enforcement have failed to root out &amp; prosecute traffickers – and internet companies have failed while sex traffickers operate on their platforms.
I firmly agree with my congressional colleagues. We MUST do more to combat sex trafficking. It’s a profound &amp; tragic failure of American institutions that trafficking has not only continued to plague this nation and has INCREASED.
It’s time to #endthelies and ensure women can get ALL the facts when making choices about their health care. Learn more about NIFLA v. Becerra:

#TrumpTax picked winners and losers. High-fliers are furiously consulting with high-priced lawyers, while real #smallbiz owners are struggling to understand what this means for them: https://t.co/eIWj7aWPLz https://t.co/MGkt4YHSQU
Here are the challenges a #smallbiz would face while navigating the #TrumpTax https://t.co/eiWLTPGbK0
Privatizing the Bonneville Power Administration would risk higher rates for Oregon families &amp; businesses. For generations, Bonneville has provided affordable, clean power to the Northwest. @realDonaldTrump selling it now? Not on my watch.
A week after an @Energy Dept. employee raised concerns about the viability of the $17 billion nuclear Waste Treatment Plant at Hanford, the employee was transferred. I have difficulty believing this was a coincidence. 
https://t.co/cxWMqeeIHf
Today at the @EnergyDems hearing, I pressed @Energy @SecretaryPerry over a possible Hanford safety cover-up and the Trump admin’s scheme to privatize Bonneville power. https://t.co/yA5YoxFW2k
Women deserve to know their rights and services available to them when making choices for their health care. Allowing women to make informed decisions does NOT violate the First Amendment. #SCOTUS
https://t.co/4nKpj1qiFi
With little oversight &amp; no meaningful intervention from @Facebook, Cambridge Analytica was able to use Facebook- developed &amp; marketed tools to weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.
I have serious concerns about the role @Facebook played in facilitating and permitting the covert collection and misuse of consumer information by Cambridge Analytica.
I’m troubled by the New York Times reporting and @Facebook’s own admission that about 50 million users’ data was downloaded and subsequently used by Cambridge Analytica, a political advertising firm, without the affirmative knowledge or consent of those users.
I wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg asking @facebook to detail the extent of misuse of its users’ private information: https://t.co/N9CYC50AHG
No doubt after this weekend that our state owns women's basketball. Congrats to @BeaverWBB &amp; @OregonWBB for both advancing to the #Sweet16. #GoBeavs #GoDucks
Great to catch up at last night's 12th straight @trailblazers win with long-time friend Harry Glickman -- a huge part of what makes Portland #RipCity. Feels like this team has a deep playoff run in them. https://t.co/qoyXqdTJ9c
The #OregonWay was on full display at today’s Linn County #2018townhall at @lbcc in Albany. Fantastic turnout &amp; conversation about earthquake preparedness, veterans, net neutrality &amp; gun violence in schools. https://t.co/UMRtgYaFog
Thanks this #StPatricksDay to the appropriately dressed (and appropriately named)Tracy Green for coming to today’s #2018townhall in Lincoln City. https://t.co/7N4EeQWjLS
Heard at today’s Lincoln County #2018townhall from residents about gun violence in schools, the Russia investigation, green energy, Trump administration assaults on public lands, &amp; more. https://t.co/wZOEO7mLWq
Happy #StPatricksDay, Oregon. Hope you can spend part of it at a #2018townhall today in Lincoln City &amp; Albany: https://t.co/3cGcudbITA
Thanks @OR_Cannabis for inviting me to speak at today’s conference in PDX. Good to have so many strong allies in our fight to modernize outdated #cannabis laws &amp; grow jobs in this biz. #ourcannabisfuture https://t.co/oulF8P47pH
Great to meet today in Portland with @Deray, @Bobbin_Singh &amp; @OJRCenter officials to hear their ideas for achieving true social justice in Oregon &amp; nationwide. https://t.co/dngFpRzAaD

The Marketplace Fairness Act harms the U.S. economy and places burdensome policies on small businesses and entrepreneurs. It shouldn’t be the role of local #smallbiz &amp; entrepreneurs to help shore up the finances of other states &amp; cities through an online sales tax.
As Senators representing states without a sales tax, we’ve introduced a resolution against this.
The Marketplace Fairness Act would require businesses selling products or services over the internet to collect sales tax, even if the seller is located in a state without a sales tax.
Proud to join @SenatorTester, @SenJeffMerkley, @SenatorShaheen &amp; @SenatorHassan in taking a stand against a nationwide online sales tax. https://t.co/A3B6SJAd2p
FOSTA-SESTA is going to pass, and when it does, it should include REAL money to put sex traffickers in jail, not just make politicians feel good. I’m pushing for an amendment to guarantee $20 million a year to investigate and prosecute sex traffickers.
So glad to see the @oregonpta during #PublicSchoolsWeek to talk family engagement and how we can work to improve high school graduation rates in Oregon. https://t.co/BQgOS90CiZ
Idaho wants to bring back discrimination over pre-existing conditions. @realDonaldTrump &amp; his admin are saying, “Go ahead and discriminate, just don’t be too obvious about it.”
That’s not the only example. The Trump team is also green-lighting junk insurance that drives up the cost of health care for women with pre-existing conditions.
Need proof that the Trump agenda of health care discrimination is hurting women? Look at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, where ideology is leading to overreach and paternalism, and young women are being denied their right to health care services. #JusticeforJane https://t.co/6B4thZlAqb
Proud of the students at Benson Polytechnic High School in Portland and students all across Oregon who stood strong on #NationalWalkoutDay. They’ve had #enough of gun violence. @BensonTechPride https://t.co/67UXMdqEoj
Banks just got a big Republican tax cut from the #GOPTaxScam. They don’t need an exemption from rules protecting consumers, too.
Instead of working to provide more protections for hardworking families, the Senate banking bill stacks the deck in favor of banks.
Today I voted against the Senate banking bill that would cut protections for consumers Congress put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. https://t.co/C4u9RRro7e
I joined @maddow on @msnbc to share why a vote for Gina Haspel to lead the @CIA is a vote for secrecy. The American people have a right to learn about Haspel’s reported involvement in the CIA torture program. https://t.co/7LRDl95gsw
The U.S. is spending DOUBLE on drugs compared to other countries for similar results - at the expense of family budgets and taxpayer dollars. It's high time to get Rx prices under control.
https://t.co/8NTAZ7oF8j
.@realDonaldTrump said during his campaign that he would bring back “a lot worse” than waterboarding. Now – he’s nominated Gina Haspel to lead the @CIA who, according to press &amp; former CIA officials, has been directly connected to torture.

Shahir Muhammad Rahman created a working smart microwave, and Raley Schweinfurth completed a study on the effect of insecticides on bees.

This morning for #NationalWalkoutDay, I joined students from across the country who are raising their voices to let lawmakers know they’ve had #enough of gun violence. #NeverAgain https://t.co/nCUhsbaZsx

.@SecretaryZinke isn’t listening to Oregonians – or any American who appreciates our natural treasures. Oil and gas executives are the only folks who seem to have his ear.
During the most expensive wildfire season in recorded history, @SecretaryZinke got caught taking money from a wildfire account at @Interior to pay for an unrelated helicopter ride. https://t.co/mW1rahZ9Ye
DON’T FORGET - @SecretaryZinke proposed opening Oregon's and most of America’s precious coasts to offshore drilling. #ProtectOurCoasts #ProtectThePacific https://t.co/CkNdIMSd1m

The CLOUD Act will give Trump - or any president- far too much power to approve surveillance agreements with human rights abusing foreign governments without real oversight by Congress. The House shouldn't attach it to the spending bill.
.@BetsyDeVos, do your homework. Teachers want to teach. Instead of giving them guns, we should give them the resources they need to improve outcomes for ALL students at our nation’s public schools. #PublicSchoolsWeek https://t.co/fe4NSRUjME
The UK says it’s highly likely Putin tried to kill a father and daughter on British soil with a deadly nerve agent.  The U.S. must stand by our allies against such flagrant attacks but Trump won’t even mention Russian involvement. https://t.co/B95f7mD3DT

Instead of a bill that stacks the deck in favor of banks, Congress could be working on commonsense gun safety measures, a permanent solution for Dreamers &amp; creating jobs by repairing our roads &amp; bridges.
After the 2008 financial crisis, Congress took steps to protect American consumers from big banks. In the wake of the Equifax security breach and Wells Fargo customer abuses, there’s clearly more work to be done.

I agree, Eva. Gun violence in schools makes me sick, too. It’s students like Hood River’s Eva Jones who are making a big difference in addressing gun violence.
https://t.co/k2CFILwe7L
As stories continue to mount about Trump money man Michael Cohen, it is inexcusable that the Senate would give him a pass. He needs to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in open session. https://t.co/C0oBTtdkbq
If passed, this would create an underground, privatized tax-collecting bureaucracy. It’s particularly shocking as only two years have passed since President Obama signed legislation making the Internet Tax Freedom Act permanent.
I'm extremely concerned to hear @HouseGOP are sneaking a massive internet tax increase into a totally unrelated spending bill. Apparently a vote for a Republican rep in Congress is now a vote to allow New York &amp; California to tax Oregonians, Pennsylvanians &amp; Texans.
I’ve been trying to audit the Pentagon for many years. It shouldn’t take another ten years to produce a clean audit. Oregon taxpayers expect more. From @morningdefense: https://t.co/LfXIsacDNT

Today, Hood River student Eva Jones spoke out at a hearing to call on Congress to act on gun safety. I was impressed by our discussion at my #2018townhall in Odell. Eva is leading by example to push for change at every level &amp; hold lawmakers accountable. #RonReport https://t.co/UAhprVCEKt

The American people will not be fooled by the #GOPTaxScam’s $200 billion buyback bonanza.
.@USATODAY Editorial Board is SPOT ON regarding the #GOPTaxScam ➡️ “Corporations have been showing more concern about shareholders than about employees or the economy as a whole.” https://t.co/iFrTTDtgjE
The #GOPTaxScam’s “buyback boom” is more proof Republicans will continue to shower corporations and the politically powerful with tax breaks at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/t7t1rINSxh
Drug companies alone have spent $50 billion dollars on stock buybacks – all to pad the financial portfolios of executives and shareholders vs. lowering the cost of prescription drugs or investing in life-saving cures of tomorrow.
Here’s a fact for Republicans in Congress ➡️ For $800 billion, every single American worker could get a bonus of nearly $5,000.
Since the #GOPTaxScam was signed into law, corporations have spent 45X MORE on buying up their own stock than on one-time bonuses for workers. Independent strategists expect stock buybacks to reach $800 BILLION by the end of 2018.
Joining Leader @SenSchumer, @SenatorBaldwin &amp; @SenBooker to call out the #GOPTaxScam for what it is – a rip off for American Taxpayers and a buyback bonanza to line the pockets of wealthy &amp; foreign shareholders. https://t.co/lj0q4Wmzj9
.@RepBonamici, @senorrinhatch and I, along with a host of bipartisan members of Congress are fighting to reauthorize Secure Rural Schools and fully fund Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT). We are going to stay at this until it gets done.
Since I wrote the legislation to create the Secure Rural Schools program, it has generated more than $7 billion to rural counties in Oregon and nationwide.
The federal government has a responsibility to support basic county programs for people who live in these counties that lack large tax bases because they host our public lands. #SecureRuralSchools
Secure Rural Schools expired in 2015. Without SRS, residents in rural counties across Oregon are facing deep funding cuts to essential services that keep students in class, put cops on the beat &amp; maintain roads and bridges. https://t.co/hFgvDTDIg9
Heading to a news conference w/@RepBonamici, @NACoTweets &amp; bipartisan members of Congress to push for Secure Rural Schools in must-pass government funding bill to fund public schools, roads &amp; bridges, libraries &amp; emergency services in 700+ counties &amp; 40+ states
More than 21,000 #Dreamers have lost their #DACA status. Until Congress creates a permanent solution, thousands will be removed from our workforce &amp; become at risk of deportation from the country they call home. #ProtectDreamers.

Fifth Third Bank’s corporate buybacks are projected to reach $3 BILLION, while the bank has paid $48 million in wage-hikes &amp; one-time bonuses. Wealthy &amp; foreign shareholders are disproportionately benefiting over families &amp; working Americans. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/D7zKiUc2t3

The #GOPTaxScam’s record breaking corporate buybacks send huge amounts of cash overseas straight into the pockets of wealthy foreigners. American taxpayers are on the hook borrowing billions of dollars to make wealthy foreigners even wealthier.

Corporations are shoveling money into investor windfalls at a rate 30 TIMES greater than worker bonuses. Republicans in Congress said workers would see bulging paychecks. Wealthy shareholders are disproportionately benefiting from #GOPTaxScam.

@SecAzar @HHSGov This is a real-world threat to people in Idaho, and the question for the Trump administration is black and white. Are you going to protect people who have pre-existing conditions, or are you going to let insurers discriminate?

The #MnuchinRule - the promise that there would be no absolute tax cut for the wealthy – is a fallacy. The #TrumpBudget admits the tax cuts don’t pay for themselves, so it hits Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid with massive cuts.

This is proof that Congress is capable of bipartisanship &amp; an example of how principled bipartisanship should work – taking each other’s good ideas. It creates a  clear contrast w/ the partisan #TrumpBudget that would starve the child welfare system through block grants.
With #FamilyFirstAct, more funds will be available for evidence-based mental health &amp; substance use treatment, family counseling &amp; parent skills training. It’ll also raise standards for group homes.

The Director of National Intelligence won’t tell us if #FISA702 can be used to collect communications the government KNOWS are entirely domestic. But the administration may release a memo the FBI says jeopardizes national security.
Remember when we were told a program that collected millions of innocent Americans’ telephone records couldn’t be revealed to the public?
If this memo comes out, I have a long list of less sensitive, but still classified, information that the American people deserve to see.  #secretlaw
If the White House releases this memo over the FBI’s objection, I don’t want to hear another word from these people about how pervasive secrecy is necessary for national security.

Massive increases in defense spending will make defense contractors rich and do nothing to make America safer. We can’t afford to waste money on Republicans’ cronies while neglecting schools and roads.
.@realDonaldTrump has replaced one disgraced Health Secretary who worked to undermine health care with another who made a fortune raising drug prices. #SOTU

Americans want more red, white and blue jobs. They want to grow things here, make things here, add value to them and then ship them somewhere. Trump has no plan to make that happen.
So much talk about trade and manufacturing, but very little action. Where is the strategy on enforcement?
Remember when the Trump Administration told America’s steelworkers to get in line and wait until after Republican tax cut?  They are still waiting. #SOTU https://t.co/51DnUGPQVu

The House spending bill doesn’t include a single penny for any of the other health extenders - like Community Health Centers, home visiting programs for new moms &amp; provisions for our rural hospitals vital to the health care of the American people.
The House bill is a historic missed opportunity. If Congress permanently funded CHIP, or at least extended it for 10 years, it would save taxpayers $6 billion dollars. It’s a sad state of affairs when America’s kids continue to take a back seat to wealthy Republican donors.
There are bipartisan solutions for DACA &amp; funding for Secure Rural Schools, deadly wildfires &amp; other natural disasters. Instead, congressional Republicans gave  $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to multinational corporations.
I will vote NO on a spending bill that fails to protect children at every turn and does not permanently protect Dreamers in Oregon and across the country. https://t.co/HrMlOYgGAF
Americans are left with a deeply flawed bill that is actually worse than current law. The rights of Americans who talk to foreigners overseas are at stake. #FISA #Section702
Americans should be deeply concerned about the Senate’s vote yesterday to end real debate and prevent the Senate from considering any amendments to the #FISA #Section702 re-authorization bill. This is not regular order.

Federal marijuana policy is an issue where the government is light years behind the times. Jeff Sessions &amp; the Trump admin are still trying to fight a 1980s drug war that’s socially unjust, economically backward &amp; against the will of the American people.

The American people will be ready to fight again. We will NOT forget this vote on the #GOPTaxScam.
Americans must know that the far right architects of the #GOPTaxScam will be coming for your Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid &amp; more before you've taken down the Christmas tree.
Middle class consumers across the country are already walking an economic tightrope. You can’t spend what you don’t have. https://t.co/BvIrbDlsAU
Even conservative economists are calling the #GOPTaxScam an absurd alternate reality.
NEW from @jctgov - the #GOPTaxScam is a tax hike on 9 million Americans in 2019. https://t.co/QYdpHzWNLB
The #GOPTaxScam:
- Showers corporations in handouts
- Raises taxes on the middle class
- Puts Medicare and Social Security at risk
- Historically unpopular with Americans
Today, the Republican party officially turns its back on America’s middle class with the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/FzsXNdo8mU
With Republicans disregarding all of the norms for careful tax policy making, they have guaranteed significant instability in US tax policy for many years to come.
The louder Americans protested, the faster Republicans raced to pass a #GOPTaxScam that will hike taxes on over 1/2 the middle class, AND leave 13 million Americans uninsured &amp; increase premiums on millions more.
The American people have exposed Republicans’ scam on the middle class &amp; their betrayal to guarantee handouts to powerful CEOs and the donor class. #GOPTaxScam
While Republicans met in SECRET for weeks, they thought the American people weren’t paying attention – but we’ve been watching the ENTIRE TIME.
From the BEGINNING this bill has been a shower of tax break goodies on multinational corporations, special interests &amp; heirs-in-waiting. Who will be paying for the #GOPTaxScam's massive handouts? The middle class. It’s a cruel double standard.
Republicans are DESPERATE to make good on promises to their wealthy donors while the American people are raising their voices to scrap this historically unpopular #GOPTaxScam.
It takes effort to completely ignore the voices of the people and give away $1.5 TRILLION to tax cheats and corporations. Americans will hold Republicans accountable.

Thank you, @ACLU, @FreedomWorks and @DemandProgress for standing up for Americans’ rights. #Section702 https://t.co/yMX11zyVHv
I will oppose any effort to short-circuit debate by jamming #Section702 re-authorization on a CR.
Congress needs an OPEN debate and an opportunity for amendment on #Section702. The American people deserve to know about the laws this Congress is passing.
The Trump admin is going BACKWARD on transparency by refusing to provide an estimate of the number of Americans swept up under #Section702.
#Section702 of FISA now is an end-run around the 4th Amendment. Our government is sweeping up untold number of Americans’ communications &amp; performing searches WITHOUT warrants.
So glad to join with @RandPaul, @SenatorLeahy, @SenMikeLee &amp; more defenders of Americans’ rights to say NO warrantless spying on year-end spending bills. Congress shouldn’t pass laws in the dark. https://t.co/LuF3tKQDdo

#Dreamers are vital contributors to our nation’s success, including more than 800 in our nation’s military. #DreamActNow

Democrats agree that the tax system is broken. It’s not too late for bold members on the other side to REJECT this this reckless partisan process and work on a bipartisan basis to put the middle class first.

Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump said “a very tiny little sliver” would be worse off because of the #GOPTaxPlan. The American people know that’s not true.
Remember this - Republicans are going to try and break this deal. Democrats aren’t going to let it happen.
After Republicans add $1.5 TRILLION to the deficit for goodies to corporations and tax cheats, they’ll say we don’t have money for basic assistance Americans need. @SpeakerRyan said so yesterday.
Make no mistake – the #GOPTaxPlan trades the health of millions of middle-class Americans for money into the pockets of corporations and the wealthy.
The #GOPTaxPlan has consequences:
- 10% higher premiums
- Rise in off-market plans w/o consumer protections
- 13 MILLION more uninsured Americans
Not only is this Republican #GOPTaxPlan going to hurt people’s paychecks – it’s going to make their health care WORSE.

It’s not too late for Republicans to change course. Instead of going to a sham conference - the Senate can have a REAL  bipartisan debate on a tax plan that gives every American a chance to get ahead.
I heard repeatedly at town halls in Oregon last weekend that the American people do NOT want #GOPTaxPlan to become law.
Now @realDonaldTrump is calling for MORE speed and secrecy in the #GOPTaxPlan process-- just so he can claim a victory and Republicans in Congress can appease mega-donors.
There is no telling what swamp creatures have crawled their way up Capitol Hill to get their claws on this bill at the eleventh hour.

REMEMBER, working Americans and families will be on the hook for massive handouts to multinational corporations.
What does #GOPTaxPlan mean for the middle class? Everything will become more expensive:
- Buying a house
- Buying a car
- Getting a credit card
- Taking out student loans
Every day there’s more frightening news about how the #GOPTaxPlan will hurt working and middle class Americans.
That is NOT what was promised in the 2016 campaign. That’s NOT what Republicans have spent month after month telling Americans their #GOPTaxPlan would do.

THE VOTES ARE IN: Senate Republicans put corporate handouts over the health and well-being of America’s middle class. 🚨 SPEAK OUT. The time for action is NOW. 🚨 #RonReport #GOPTaxPlan https://t.co/i4qMeHe8jw
This is indefensible, partisan legislation, and this is a dark day for this storied committee. But Democrats will continue to fight.
Don’t forget - 13 million Americans are going to get kicked off their health care. Premiums will skyrocket for millions more. All because of massive handouts to corporations.
Because of the #GOPTaxPlan, millions and millions of low-income and middle-income Americans are going to get HIT with a tax hike they can’t afford.
This will be remembered as the day Republicans traded the health and well-being of millions of Americans for massive corporate handouts.
@RoyBlunt The @USTreasury has told us that a 2-year provision would expire before they can even write the regulations to implement it.
@RoyBlunt A short-term proposal puts small brewers, vintners, cider makers &amp; distillers in a position where every year or 2 they have to grovel for lawmakers to extend their tax incentive.
@RoyBlunt The #GOPTaxPlan makes it temporary, and turns it into a full employment program for lobbyists paid to keep it from dying.
.@RoyBlunt and I wrote a bipartisan bill contributing to jobs in the beverage industry. What’s in the Chairman’s modified mark is NOT our whole bill. Instead - it’s a 2-year version.
Bottom line - Tax cuts for hard-working families should NEVER, ever be held hostage to lock in tax cuts for corporations. #GOPTaxPlan https://t.co/bOmgArjUI6
Making tax cuts for families contingent on tax cuts for multinational corporations in #GOPTaxPlan is WRONG, reckless, and the kind of cynical legislating the American people find revolting.

@jctgov @SenateFinance @SenSherrodBrown @realDonaldTrump When the history of the @SenateFinance Committee is written, this will be a dark, dark chapter.
@jctgov @SenateFinance @SenSherrodBrown @realDonaldTrump It’s easy to see this #GOPTaxPlan process is about getting this bill out of committee and back behind closed doors.
@jctgov @SenateFinance Yesterday @SenSherrodBrown proposed an amendment to keep red, white and blue jobs from going overseas. @realDonaldTrump has TWICE said he supports it. Senate Republicans BLOCKED it.
@jctgov @SenateFinance Americans, while you’re reaching for the cranberry sauce, Republicans are going to be reaching for your pocketbooks to give handouts to multinational corporations.
@jctgov This is shameful and reckless haste. And once this @SenateFinance process wraps up, the #GOPTaxPlan is back behind closed doors.
@jctgov Senate Republicans, why is it a good idea to hike taxes on parents who are barely staying afloat to pay for a massive corporate handout?
@jctgov In 2027 – Families earning $75,000 and under would have a tax hike of $27 BILLION. Meanwhile,  multinational corporations get a PERMANENT CUT.
Low income Americans - Families earning $30,000 and under in 2021 are going to get walloped by a tax hike of nearly $6 BILLION, via @jctgov.

JUST IN: Not only are Republicans trading Americans' health care for corporate handouts, but they shot down every amendment for veterans, Medicare &amp; Social Security and red, white and blue jobs. Recap of @SenateFinance #GOPTaxPlan markup day 3 #RonReport https://t.co/QgmSzDF01c
The public is not going to get any time to see what the House and Senate Republicans hash out. Americans deserve to know where the Senate stands on the House #GOPTaxPlan.
Tonight @SenBennetCO gave Republicans a chance to protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts caused by their plan. They voted NO.
The revisionist history in this room is shocking. Republicans claiming to be solving problems in the economy but they conveniently forget that Republicans CAUSED those problems in the first place. How can they be trusted to FIX them?
These are amendments that impact millions of Americans, and we’re hastily rushing through this #GOPTaxPlan markup. We NEED time to ask questions. The American people deserve answers.
I can’t say it enough. TEMPORARY tax cuts for the middle class to pay for PERMANENT tax cuts for multinational corporations is wrong. That’s the #GOPTaxPlan. https://t.co/YPRheuAnQl

For congressional Republicans, it’s not enough to take away health care from millions by making the middle class pay for multinational corporation tax cuts.
Millions of Americans are going to lose their health care, see their premiums skyrocket, and get hit with a tax hike – all to give multinational corporations massive handouts. https://t.co/wWqgNeDo6Q
Bottom line - My colleagues on the other side have shown their hand. For middle class families, this deal is looking worse and worse.
Does the Treasury Secretary remember when he said the administration would draw a line in the sand for permanent breaks for multinational corporations. But where are they now when it comes to helping middle class families?
Today, Americans are learning that what they’re getting out of the bill as individuals is TEMPORARY, and what corporations are getting is PERMANENT, set in stone.
Let’s not kid around. This is not just a another attack on the Affordable Care Act. This is repeal of that law and officially a health care bill.
Cut to yesterday 1:30pm- The new scheme? Permanent corporate tax cuts should be paid for, in part, by kicking 13 million Americans off their health care and raising premiums for millions more.
This #GOPTaxPlan proposal seems to be getting worse by the hour. It began as a tax hike on nearly 14 million Americans to pay for multi-trillion dollar handouts to corporations and new loopholes for tax cheats.
I’m back in @SenateFinance on markup day 3 to protect the middle class and wage earning Americans from a #GOPTaxPlan that gets worse by the hour. My staff will be providing updates here. Tune in: https://t.co/VnnYQGciWe

@POTUS Bottom line, this entire bill is about putting an economic double standard into black letter law – and the American people won’t like it.
Medical expense deduction: gone. @POTUS didn’t tell seniors during his campaign that they'd lose the ability to deduct health expenses.
College grads will lose their write-off for student loan interest, but corporations will still be able to write off their interest payments.
Corporations will still get to deduct their state and local taxes, but individuals and families won’t.
It’s a double standard. Corporations get permanent breaks while wage-earning families get the rug pulled out from under them.
The bill's about giving enough crumbs to some of the middle class to distract from multi-trillion $ giveaways &amp; shipping jobs overseas.

@senorrinhatch No child should be unsafe in foster care yet far too many are. Our legislation increases oversight of child welfare https://t.co/eZqK20bLHf
@senorrinhatch What’s even more outrageous is that efforts to fix flaws in the system have been held up by stonewalling in the United States Senate.
@senorrinhatch The system has so little oversight the government can’t even collect data about gaps in the system that advocates tell us are getting worse.
@senorrinhatch It exposes widespread failure to protect children at every level of our child welfare system.
@senorrinhatch Our investigation examined the circumstances around multiple cases of child abuse, neglect &amp; even child deaths.

The GOP tax plan is a heist to take trillions from Social Security &amp; Medicare &amp; give it to the wealthy in tax breaks. We will not stand for it. 15/15
#TaxReform ought to be all about giving everybody in America the opportunity to get ahead &amp; be partisan. #TrumpTaxScam is the opposite. 14/
.@SenateDems laid out our principles on #taxreform. @SenateMajLdr rejected them within hours. That’s not bipartisanship. 13/
The Republican framework looks less like a real effort at tax reform than a shameless attempt to accommodate the president’s boasting about the biggest tax cut ever. 12/
#TrumpTaxScam means millions of middle-class Americans are facing the prospect of a big tax hike. 11/
Current middle-class tax breaks on the chopping block:
❌The personal exemption. 
❌The state and local tax deduction. 
❌Incentives for retirement savings, education, home ownership, &amp; more.
10/
When you do the math on what Republicans have on offer, you’re looking at upward of 4, 5, 6 TRILLION dollars in tax giveaways to the most fortunate. 9/
The top income tax rate goes down, the bottom income tax rate goes up. #trumptaxscam 8/
#TrumpTaxScam eliminates the AMT &amp; the estate tax, which today only touches estates worth more than 11 million dollars or 5.5 million for a single individual. 7/
There’s a brand new passthrough loophole -- the Grand Canyon of loopholes -- that invites tax cheats to skip out on paying their fair share to Social Security &amp; Medicare. 6/
The Republican tax cut framework green-lights the entire wish list for big corporations and the wealthy. 5/
There is no comparison between the bipartisan #taxreform I wrote &amp; the #TrumpTaxScam – ZERO. 4/
What GOP have offered in the Trump tax plan is a tax INCREASE to millions of middle-class families to pay for massive, unprecedented tax giveaways to corporations and those at the top. 3/
If you have a minute, I laid out exactly what real bipartisan #taxreform looks like. It is the opposite of what GOP is pushing. 2/

20 senators support my #votebymail bill. Learn more here: https://t.co/KVKHiigbDx
#Votebymail means paper ballots, weeks to fix any registration problems and audits afterward.
Too many questions about security last election. We need #votebymail for the strongest protection against hacking https://t.co/WkeJAQEeeb
I raised serious concerns about these abhorrent comments Bradford alleged a "hacker" made. https://t.co/K4dyyIUbGL
Good. There's one iota less of hate in the Administration today. https://t.co/n0aiCfC9Dt
Trump's tax "plan": Crumbs for the middle class, cakes for the fortunate few. That's not tax reform, that's highway robbery.
Who benefits the most from the tax "plan" Trump's @whitehouse released? The top 0.1% https://t.co/6yjnBCsz0L
Wait, that's it?? No details?
Facts Schmacts https://t.co/pyIY3QLuAa
No evidence that lower corporate taxes mean higher wages. They mean higher profits and bigger dividends.
The only thing you are surrendering to with this tax "plan" is big special interests
Democrats are not looking to obstruct *real* tax reform. Our letter to Trump &amp; GOP leaders: https://t.co/Q2k2UPTdhg
We will not know if Trump would benefit from tax "reform"since he refuses to release his tax returns.
Tax cuts ≠ Economic Growth https://t.co/5Sfbn6d6oy
What do you know about workers, Mr. President? Besides ripping them off at Trump Org.
Work with Democrats, Mr. President? Your office hasn't called...
Trump is about to give a speech on tax “reform.” I’ll be live tweeting &amp; fact-checking as he goes. https://t.co/yBKE5gSgQ5
This strikes at the heart of the rule of law in America. It violates his oath of office.
The Arpaio pardon says, if you are a law-enforcement official who supports Trump, break the law &amp; he'll protect you.
.@realDonaldTrump playing politics w/military &amp; servicemembers makes us less safe/less free. This isn't who America is #ProtectTransTroops
Thx Tillamook Co. for coming on a beautiful Manzanita day to educate me about veterans, environment &amp; more at my 64th #2017townhall this yr. https://t.co/fX8cMzdp7H
Thnx Clatsop County for today's great #2017townhall in Seaside focused on the Oregon Way wanting solutions on tax reform, healthcare &amp; more. https://t.co/jnYm93MAhq
@SecretaryZinke Keeping this report secret = administration ignoring Oregonians who spoke publicly to protect #CascadeSiskiyou. #KeepItPublic
Retweet if you agree: Decisions about our #publiclands must be made in public. @SecretaryZinke #ReleaseTheReport #MakeItPublic

Gratified to hear this AM in PDX how @Lines_for_Life is expanding its role on the front lines helping veterans needing crisis hotline help. https://t.co/vXvxWpuifD
If Trump pardons this man and sanctions this brand of lawlessness, he will again be endorsing white supremacy and attacking the rule of law.
Law enforcement refusing to obey the courts threatens the foundations of our republic. That’s what Joe Arpaio did.
Joining w/all Oregon to say thanks to the firefighters battling the Chetco Bar, Milli, Warm Springs fires &amp; all the blazes raging statewide.
Bannon is gone, but Trump hasn't changed. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. We have to keep up the pressure.
When there are so many patients who can't afford EpiPens, Mylan's low-ball settlement adds insult to injury.
A $465 million settlement to a single firm that ripped off taxpayers by $1.3 billion looks like another awfully sweet deal for big pharma https://t.co/B63pU5UEb9
Claiming you'd murder prisoners only helps recruit more terrorists. https://t.co/c69enoWhNM
We must stand against all terrorism, including the heinous attack in Barcelona.
Ridiculous that Trump chose to abandon effort to promote American jobs to focus on defending monuments glorifying slavery and treason.
The president is too busy defending 20th century shrines to white supremacy to focus on fixing roads or creating jobs https://t.co/LqG3LzTuyi
Immigrant youth make such valuable contributions to Oregon &amp; America. #DefendDACA
My parents fled Nazi Germany. There's no "many siding" this Mr. President.
Off prompter and in his own words, the president gives comfort to white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Absolutely horrifying.
That's only making insurance companies "great" - not America.
Trump's games will cause Americans' health premiums to skyrocket 20 percent. https://t.co/DIe3XWUX6W
White supremacists and neo-Nazis are truly bad people. Try saying that. https://t.co/20f0iCppv2
What happened in Charlottesville is domestic terrorism. The President's words only serve to offer cover for heinous acts.

Proud to lead @SenateDems to introduce the #EqualDignity for Married Taxpayers Act. https://t.co/usSMcHWYjc

.@SenateGOP: Time to govern so we can provide economic relief to middle class. That means including @senatedems today in #taxreform talks.
All @senatedems agree: #TaxReform must help middle class, not the fortunate few https://t.co/KcCp5G2vSB
Basic proposition: #TaxReform should put money in the pockets of the middle class. Should not lower taxes for wealthiest few or add to debt. https://t.co/GiB63QvGBD
This is damaging &amp; irresponsible. Joined @SenSherrodBrown &amp; @SenFeinstein to demand answers. https://t.co/RkMcblD25s
Kobach's voter suppression commission published Americans' sensitive, personal information from when they commented to the commission. https://t.co/BlCswH4Ryf
This sabotage will cost families dearly. Expected to raise premiums by double digits in just a few months.

I am voting no on this bill. For every Oregonian &amp; American who has spoken out, THANK YOU.
On the floor now speaking out against this travesty of a bill https://t.co/MpgYmFMSGh
This isn't "freedom." This is gutting for millions of Americans
#Trumpcare "skinny" repeal text is out. Destroys insurance markets &amp; defunds Planned Parenthood.
How come no GOP senator will come on the floor and defend their #Trumpcare bill?
How much time will the @SenateGOP make the #Trumpcare bill public before the vote? (Price is right rules)
Don’t be fooled. ‘Skinny bill’ packs a wallop. Premiums soar 20% IN ONE YEAR. 16 million lose coverage.

On the day Senate is set to vote, the future of American health care got a rewrite btwn the salad course &amp; entrée https://t.co/pXwTeDmulw
This fight for our health care is just one example of what’s at stake if GOP rolls back #netneutrality protections that allow us to organize
Strong #NetNeutrality protections make sure that Big Cable or moneyed interests cannot filter out our speech.
In all of this, we cannot forget our fight for #netneutrality. Net neutrality is what allows us to organize &amp; communicate online!
@SenateGOP What we do know is that we have to leave it all on the field. Make those calls. Show up. Do not relent. Your pressure is key.
Today is the day. @SenateGOP will have a "final vote" sometime in the next 24 hours on a bill. Which bill? We don't know.
This is why @PattyMurray and I fought to get this CBO score so quickly. Americans deserve to know what impacts policies have!

Remember: Mitch McConnell's end goal is "skinny" repeal. It's a fraud. House won't accept it. It's an on-ramp to #Trumpcare, nothing less.
America isn’t fooled. Laid out with @SenSanders the damage #Trumpcare does to Americans &amp; the gifts it gives the wealthy. https://t.co/FhxvZx5W7U
I see your tweets. Thank you for continuing to fight even when it's exhausting. We cannot relent.
On the floor to lead @SenateDems against this partisan plan to rip health care from millions of Americans &amp; raise costs for millions more. https://t.co/A6rCtgch73
Trump chooses bigotry over security. Shutting out transgender Americans who want to serve our country makes us less safe, not safer.
It's on us to make sure every senator knows they will be held accountable if they vote for a policy that hurts Americans.
Mitch McConnell will swoop in with a mystery bill at the end.  It will be a mystery to your GOP senator, too.
Senate GOP voted to move onto Trumpcare without knowing what the bill will be. Wrong &amp; irresponsible.
Mitch McConnell is working hard to get this bill passed. We need you to work harder to stop it.
This is not over. You've got time to call, to tweet, to email, to show up.
It's 12:30 pm in DC, vote is in 2 hours, have you called your senator on health care today? Retweet once you have!
As I said on @maddow, you are a grassroots juggernaut. #Trumpcare vote is hours away. KEEP IT UP. https://t.co/WZzgEle4xs
It says a lot about the president that he's attacking his single most loyal supporter -- Jeff Sessions.
About to be on @maddow discussing health care &amp; Russia investigation. Tune in if you can.
Prove our commitment to not throwing 22 million Americans to the wolves on health care. #KillTheBill
This is it, folks. Leave it all on the field. Call. Tweet. Text. Email. Show up. https://t.co/GIcaI40Vye

It's clear the buck stops anywhere but with the Commander in Chief.
The president would rather sabotage health care markets &amp; gamble with people's health than do bipartisan work https://t.co/IA9hHgOJze
Republicans have had 7 years to agree on a replacement. 6 months in full control of gov't. It is not happening. #RepealAndRun
HALF of US will have no insurance options in market next yr if #RepealAndRun passes. That’s no stable transition GOP https://t.co/4G3LrIxv8e
The GOP talk about a 2 year transition is a fraud. With #RepealAndRun, health care markets collapse instantly, and GOP knows it.
#RepealAndRun is back. 
Tax cuts for the wealthy.
Medicaid slashed. 
No tax credits for middle-class families.
Instead of working together to improve health care Republicans would rather rip it away for political gain.
#Trumpcare is on the brink because people are speaking out and standing up. Keep pushing to make health care better, not worse.
When you don't like the rules so you make yourself the umpire https://t.co/MIAXFcsl0n

✔️Ripping off middle class

Republicans are buying votes by blowing a hole in the American health care system, and then they're shoveling taxpayer dollars into it.
Taxpayers are going to get stuck with the astronomical costs of cleaning up the damage from this Cruz scheme.
By including Cruz proposal, Trumpcare will:
—destroy marketplace
—send premiums skyhigh
—make care unaffordable if you have pre-ex condition
No one in Oregon or in America is ok w/a #Trumpcare bill that just delays tax breaks for the fortunate few. Yet that’s what the GOP is doing
HAPPENING NOW: Press conference on still disastrous version of #Trumpcare https://t.co/dbZdUeAjkJ

Trump also wants Oregon to send voters’ personal information to an insecure email address – a bonanza for hackers. https://t.co/d7bV2lVMQs
There is no way the federal govt should get Oregonians’ sensitive information when it can’t even keep classified staffer data safe.
This request is also a tool of voter suppression and should not be validated in any way, shape or form.
Complying with the request is a direct threat to Oregonians’ security, privacy &amp; right to vote.
.@OregonSOS Richardson should follow the lead of other SOSs &amp; not send Oregonians’ voter data to Kobach's commission https://t.co/cWwuqDYjob
Here is a link to the full CBO report on the long-term effects of #Trumpcare cuts to #Medicaid https://t.co/OoNyMwSHFW

Speaking on the floor w/@SenateFinence members about our continued fight against policy that makes health care worse https://t.co/rP3wl2cJBY
@SenateGOP We will not stop until Republicans end this partisan process that will make health care worse. #trumpcare
We will work harder. We will show up. We will speak out. @SenateGOP cannot hide from their constituents.
McConnell will work over the Fourth of July to get the votes to take away health insurance from 22 million Americans.
Fighting hard against #Trumpcare b/c it does not make health care better. It only raises health costs to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.

Premiums for folks in 50s &amp; 60s will skyrocket. Kids &amp; Americans with disabilities risk losing care. Women pay more. #Trumpcare

My questions to James Comey about Trump's efforts to quash the Russia investigation #ComeyHearing https://t.co/15DvrYHiJF
VP Pence was the head of the transition.  To your knowledge, was he aware of the concerns re: Flynn prior to, or during Flynn’s tenure?
Did you get the impression that the President knew when and how frequently Flynn had talked with the Russians or what they talked about?
Mr. Comey, in a patronage relationship isn't the underling expected to behave in a manner consistent w/the wishes of the boss? #ComeyHearing
Mr. Comey, you said that you believed the president was trying to create "some sort of patronage relationship." #ComeyHearing
How would you characterize AG Sessions’ adherence to his recusal particularly in regard to your firing? #ComeyHearing
What was it about Sessions’ interactions w/the Russians, or his behavior that led FBI to determine not to discuss Trump’s actions with him?
Mr. Comey, you and I have had strong policy differences over the years. But I believe the timing of your firing stinks. #ComeyHearing

In all the Comey craziness, do not forget that @SecPriceMD is coming to testify in @senatefinance on Trump's disastrous budget.

Americans must know the answers to these questions.  Nothing could be more in the public interest.
Testimony about whether the President tried to stop an investigation is not classified and must not be relegated to a closed session.
I'd say the hypocrisy is stunning. But I'm not surprised.
DNI says sweeping up calls &amp; emails from American citizens is fine. But figuring out how many of those comms = huge invasion of privacy.
Can the government use Section 702 to collect communications it knows are entirely domestic?
Dir. Coats, will you clarify this testimony and tell us the types of targets under Section 702?
The government has given several different explanations of who is targeted under FISA sec. 702
Did any of you write memos/take notes/otherwise record yours or anyone else’s interactions with POTUS related to the Russia investigation?

Chairman Burr asked the Admin to return the #TortureReport &amp; the Trump Admin said yes.
Remember – the U.S. shut down compounds in response to Russia’s attack on our democracy in last year’s election.

It cuts $33 BILLION from #Medicare. Which Trump promised not to touch. https://t.co/Z4UJonDYQN
#TrumpBudget slashes #Medicaid by over $600 billion, putting kids’ care &amp; seniors’ nursing home benefit on the chopping block.
#TrumpBudget cuts care for kids under bipartisan program (CHIP) that provides health insurance for 8 million+ kids. KIDS. Unbelievably cruel
#TrumpBudget is a giveaway to special interests at the expense of kids, working families &amp; seniors.
#TrumpBudget is brainless. It is heartless. And it relies on Madoff-style accounting tricks.
This is where the #TrumpBudget belongs. https://t.co/5YtP39OPVx
Demanding answers on @SeemaCMS’s attempts to hold Americans’ health care hostage for support of #Trumpcare. Unacceptable. https://t.co/veB3h6Gheq
@realDonaldTrump The GOP’s political games mean Americans won’t know if their health care will be there for then when they need it. It’s cruel.

I cannot support any tax plan that doesn’t focus on American jobs, stimulate our economy &amp; preserve progressivity.
You may follow GoT. I follow tax reform. And the Trump tax plan is a disaster: https://t.co/ST0fD5gCmE

As I told @allinwithchris - I'm going to stay on this. We will not stop following the money in the Russia investigation. #inners https://t.co/1Rs69P6wuz
Tonight I'll be on @allinwithchris at 8 pm to discussing the Trump/Russia investigation. Tune in if you can!
This appointment didn’t just happen. It happened because Americans said enough was enough &amp; demanded accountability.
Mueller must have the resources and independence necessary to carry out a thorough investigation with integrity.
This is a start at figuring out what exactly happened to our democracy. https://t.co/fc4ljbOnbr
Heading to the floor to lay out why #netneutrality is incredibly important &amp; why FCC’s rollback would decimate it ➡️ https://t.co/ylmct0Xukk
Tomorrow, Trump’s FCC will vote on beginning the rollback of #NetNeutrality. We won’t stand for it! https://t.co/zN2q6FKOhN
Did Attorney General Sessions violate his recusal? Joined @MartinHeinrich &amp; @SenWarren to demand answers: https://t.co/2MSmGnYcU2
It is more important than ever for Director Comey to testify in an open hearing. Americans need to hear from him what happened.
It bears repeating: Did Trump ask Comey to end the investigation? My take on why that's important on @theleadCNN https://t.co/mIA9NunQcN

Trump is hurting our security. Allies are already saying they may not share intelligence on threats to Americans.
Further, naming a politician as FBI Director would be a grave mistake &amp; an insult to the rule of law &amp; the men &amp; women of the FBI.
The president’s actions have made a special counsel necessary. Absolutely no FBI Dir should be considered until special counsel is appointed
This kind of disclosure could harm national security by jeopardizing important sources of information needed to disrupt terrorist attacks.
These reports, if true, are of the gravest possible concern https://t.co/VzEprQgGwI
Reminder: @SenateGOP is still writing a terrible health bill behind closed doors with an eye for passage this summer https://t.co/6dRYRlYwnm
From Trump's own words, it looks like Comey was fired to make the Russia investigation go away. My take on @maddow https://t.co/UmLlUvysoy
Will be on @maddow tonight to discuss Russia investigation &amp; Comey’s firing. Tune in if you can!
Trump (again) shows exactly why we need an independent special counsel and why we need it NOW. https://t.co/GxRhMJuV6H
The only question is whether Trump, or someone associated with him, also coordinated with the Russian efforts.
So the question is not whether Trump actively encouraged Russians &amp; Wikileaks to attack our democracy. He did. That's an established fact.
Trump also said repeatedly that he loved Wikileaks. https://t.co/GxTOxL2OA9
I fear my colleagues are forgetting that Donald Trump urged the Russians to hack his opponent.
...I said that if the information didn’t come out before Inauguration Day, it might never come out. https://t.co/MgKGsGHGpT
In January, when Comey refused to give an investigation update...
Dir. Comey should be here testifying to the American people about where the investigation he’s been running stands.
The timing of Comey's firing is wrong to anyone with a semblance of ethics.
Asking questions now: https://t.co/xTGsgKL1HZ
Turning my twitter over to @WydenPress
Tune in. Senate Intelligence OPEN hearing starts now. Acting FBI Director testifying. https://t.co/xTGsgKL1HZ
Important that Mr. Comey has been invited to testify on Tuesday. But he should testify in an open hearing as well. Public deserves answers.

In America the truth always comes out, @realDonaldTrump.
Comey should be immediately called to testify in an open hearing about the status of Russia/Trump investigation at the time he was fired.
.@AjitPaiFCC @brianschatz Protecting #netneutrality is extremely important &amp; it's critical the comment form can handle the influx of voices.
