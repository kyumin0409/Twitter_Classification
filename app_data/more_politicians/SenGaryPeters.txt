I’ve been very disturbed by Saudi Arabia’s actions: from the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  I’ve previously voted to end support for Saudi-led coalition in Yemen—and am cosponsoring @SenSanders’ effort for today's vote https://t.co/Epdl4X4Z5l
Even President Trump’s agencies agree: if we don't take climate change seriously, it will devastate our economy, environment &amp; our way of life. Climate change can be an opportunity for new, clean-energy jobs in MI &amp; across the U.S. We must act now. https://t.co/jfaTuYnwnt
Congress and the Trump Administration must focus on policies that encourage automakers to invest in American R&amp;D and manufacturing facilities to create good-paying jobs in the United States and ensure continued American leadership in the automotive industry. (3/3)
As GM considers further investment and employment decisions, I strongly encourage them to hire, invest and grow here in the United States. American workers make the best products, and they can out-compete anyone when given a level playing field. (2/3)
I’m extremely disappointed by GM’s announcement to cut thousands of jobs, and my heart goes out to the Michigan workers and their families who are receiving this terrible news during the holiday season. (1/3)
From my family to yours, #HappyThanksgiving! Thankful today for family and friends—and our brave men and women in uniform spending this day away from loved ones to keep us safe. https://t.co/q1QTNNEuPV

That’s why I’m glad the Senate passed my provision to establish a Center of Expertise for Great Lakes oil spill response. This is an important step in ensuring we are better prepared to protect our resources for future generations. https://t.co/hLtTlpFqye
Last year the Coast Guard Commandant told me they were not prepared for an oil spill in the #GreatLakes &amp; that more research must be done. That’s incredibly alarming—40 million people rely on the Great Lakes for safe drinking water.
#PFAS contamination is a national health crisis—and the EPA must prioritize it accordingly. I’ll continue pressing the Trump Administration for swift action. From @WNEMTV5news → https://t.co/kx3swsGrZM

It’s more important than ever that Congress take action to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. America cannot tolerate threats to our democracy from foreign adversaries like Russia who seek to interfere in our elections https://t.co/kW4JdDzaAW
President Trump’s replacement of AG Sessions is alarming. The Russia investigation is about our national security, not politics. Given his views on limiting the investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from oversight of Special Counsel Mueller https://t.co/U3RcE9CgPP
Congratulations Andrea! Appreciated your testimony on PFAS contamination at a recent Senate hearing. This is an issue impacting Michiganders and families across America. https://t.co/muBgPGe08G

As Americans continue to reel from the atrocity in Pittsburgh, my thoughts are w those who lost loved ones. I’m thankful for police who took on the shooter &amp; sustained injuries to prevent more deaths. Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to protect us.
I ask all Americans to unify against this anti-Semitic act of hate. But we need to do much more to help keep Americans safe from this kind of deadly violence. https://t.co/44fYPeLtQ5
Shocked and horrified by the news from Pittsburgh that Jewish people were targeted &amp; murdered while worshipping on Shabbat. Once again our worst fears were realized as a shooting rampage terrorized a house of worship. I pray for the victims and their families.

The Senate today had a chance to protect people w/pre-existing conditions and stop the Trump Administration’s expansion of plans that don’t cover basic, essential health benefits. Unfortunately Senate Republicans blocked this bill from moving forward. https://t.co/BGcD7yCKGc

Very disappointing. EPA committed to community engagement meeting on #PFAS contamination.

It’s a win-win-win: it —

✅ Reduces financial burdens on students
✅ Gives employers the opportunity to hire skilled workers
✅ Boosts economy in rural &amp; small communities

I visited @BakerCollege’s Auto/Diesel Institute in Owosso to learn more about their career and technical ed programs. These are great ways to close skills gap and fill job openings that need specialized skills https://t.co/yWuGkkwPyO
We need change in culture at MSU &amp; other institutions so when young people come forward, they are heard, respected &amp; action is taken. Disappointed w/ responses I heard yesterday from Mr. Engler &amp; concerned not enough is being done. Watch below via @WOODTV: https://t.co/LQa8yQlKfi

Sergio Marchionne invested in Chrysler &amp; Michigan’s engineers and autoworkers. His ingenuity and passion helped save thousands of jobs in our state. I’m saddened by his passing, and my thoughts are with everyone at FCA during this difficult time. https://t.co/IUs1fBeOmE

#Montenegro has overcome repeated acts of aggression from Russia to join @NATO—they are a welcomed ally in countering Putin’s destabilizing activities. I was proud to support Montenegro’s accession to NATO &amp; stand w/them in upholding democracy.
Michigan’s entrepreneurs are making our state the startup capital of the Midwest. I saw that firsthand earlier this week at @ferriswheel in Flint. Check out my floor speech on #StartupWeek: https://t.co/Jc5H4R07vq
#StartupWeek is an important reminder why we need #NetNeutrality. An open internet lets innovators access new opportunity. Without it, they can be relegated to a slow lane while major corporations call the shots. I urge the House to pass CRA restoring #NetNeutrality protections.
This week is #StartupWeek! Proud to highlight the amazing work done by Michigan entrepreneurs. Did you know over 500,000 entrepreneurs start new companies every month? I’ll be talking about it on the Senate floor soon —tune in here: https://t.co/8PD0uuzKjb
The Trump Administration froze a payment program ensuring those w/pre-existing conditions have access to affordable care. Without it premiums will skyrocket.

And in case my Republican colleagues needed any more justification, today’s press conference in Helsinki should leave no doubt that Congress must act swiftly to protect Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference https://t.co/wAzivmu2PQ
Absolutely appalled by President Trump’s press conference &amp; fact that he openly sided w Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies. Russia must be held accountable for election meddling, but Trump has given Putin green light to continue undermining our democracy, nat’l security

Our next Supreme Court justice should represent and respect the worth of all Americans, protect free speech and preserve the individual rights of all citizens, including the ability to make their own health care decisions. I urge President Trump to do the right thing.
I hear all the time from Michiganders worried about high health care costs. The Trump Administration’s actions will only raise costs on more Americans and take us back to the days when insurance companies denied care to people w/pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/xtl7uN8Ot1

I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to respond to this ruling with legislation—because when labor unions are strong, working class families are strong.
Yesterday’s Supreme Court ruling was very disappointing ruling for Michigan families who rely on labor unions to fight for them at the negotiating table for better wages and opportunity. https://t.co/ANjTiNx43W
Labor unions built America’s middle class. Guided by the ideal that workers have the right to band together and collectively bargain for a better workplace, the labor movement has lifted millions of Americans into the middle class.
Spoke with @FIRSTweets students from Michigan yesterday about importance of #STEM—these students are the next generation of innovators! https://t.co/uIPaSW5UC5
Three years ago today, #MarriageEquality became law of the land. We've made progress but there's still more to be done in the fight for equality. Proud to continue standing w/Michigan's LGBT community #PrideMonth
This divisive executive order does nothing to keep us safe and serves as a propaganda tool for recruitment by terrorists and extremist groups intent on attacking the United States and our allies.
POTUS has made clear this ban is intended to be discriminatory—like previous versions that couldn't pass legal muster. I am proud to represent a vibrant Arab American and Muslim American community &amp; have heard firsthand from local leaders about the consequences of the #TravelBan
As a member of the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, I am focused every day on steps we can take to keeping Americans safe from those who wish to do us harm.

During #SmallBusinessWeek let’s remember how the internet gave startups &amp; small businesses unlimited growth potential with new ways to reach more consumers. Protecting small businesses’ access to the internet is one of the reasons why I'm fighting to save #NetNeutrality https://t.co/peiLLaW7PB
I’m joining my colleagues in signing the petition to force a vote in the Senate to save #NetNeutrality because big corporations should not be able to dominate the internet at the expense of Michigan families and small businesses. https://t.co/W7qbuhASNy

Watch: I questioned U.S. Coast Guard Commandant nominee Karl Schutlz on the Coast Guard’s investigation of Line 5 damage and the need for suitable resources to quickly respond to an oil spill in the Great Lakes. https://t.co/Myp3I3lrwr
As EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt has: 

❌ A dangerous anti-environmental track record
❌ Spent taxpayer money on luxury travel
❌ Violated federal spending laws 

It is past time for President Trump to fire Scott Pruitt. https://t.co/1HBNxwomAK
Big congratulations to Michigan’s own @des_linden on becoming the first American woman since 1985 to win the #BostonMarathon! https://t.co/R60rQW7dwU
Not only is there a lack of clear understanding of the damage to Line 5, but the on-site response equipment available is completely inadequate to clean a potential oil spill under current conditions, putting the Great Lakes in grave - and unnecessary - danger.
It is simply reckless and irresponsible to operate Line 5 under the current weather conditions. I was able to work with PHMSA in pressing Enbridge to suspend Line 5 operations through the storm.
Breaking: Due to storm conditions Line 5 operations are currently suspended. https://t.co/RzMZIC093x
Americans who work hard their entire life &amp; play by the rules deserve to retire w/ dignity. Today, the sad fact is too many do not have access to a pension or retirement plan.

There are few greater dangers to the Great Lakes than an oil spill in the Straits of Mackinac, which would devastate Michigan’s environment and our economy.
Given the damage caused by vessel activity, lack of visual inspection, &amp; impending storm, I am calling for PHMSA &amp; DEQ to suspend operation of Line 5 until a visual evaluation is complete &amp; Michiganders can be sure that Line 5’s integrity has not been compromised https://t.co/WVTd7RYQiF
Following reports of multiple dents in Line 5 caused by vessel activity in the Straits of Mackinac, I demanded answers from U.S. Coast Guard officials on the decision to keep the pipeline operational. https://t.co/LCHJy4NjIC
President Trump needs to drain his own swamp and fire Scott Pruitt.
As EPA Administrator, he’s not only rolled back critical environmental protections but he’s also wasted taxpayer money with first-class travel, lavish raises &amp; more
I voted against Scott Pruitt for EPA Administrator because I knew he would put special interests &amp; big oil corporations ahead of our environment, clean air and safe water.
The investigation into Russia’s election interference is critical to protecting our democracy from foreign manipulation. President Trump needs to stop undermining this investigation with threats to fire Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy AG Rosenstein #ProtectMueller https://t.co/Knd5p5xIqW

Congrats to @boyscouts Troop 215 in Grand Rapids on turning 100! As an Eagle Scout, I’m proud to honor this troop that has instilled the value of leadership through service in countless scouts – including President Gerald Ford and Astronaut Roger Chaffee https://t.co/vsQr4yYZ9k
I urged Senate leaders to include funding for community health centers &amp; I’m glad this deal will help health centers across Michigan stay open so they can continue to offer affordable health care to Michigan veterans, seniors and families.
The budget deal offers certainty to our military and addresses many outstanding funding priorities. I hope Congress quickly passes this bipartisan solution that keeps the government functioning &amp; helps middle class families. https://t.co/IWCNQurIHh
As a member of @SASCDems I hear regularly from Dept. of Defense officials about underfunded military priorities. Not once have I been told “we need money for a parade.” https://t.co/2RVI3Uinx9
I’m joining a bipartisan group of my colleagues – led by @SenStabenow – in calling for Senate leadership to extend funding for community health centers so they can continue to provide cost-effective care https://t.co/paMxd1A7t3
Community health centers offer preventative care to families in both cities and rural communities, they help fight the opioid epidemic and they offer affordable, quality medical, dental, vision and behavioral health care to more than 27 million Americans

State of MI just informed my office that next month, they’ll start notifying MI families w/ kids on CHIP that their children may lose their health care if we don’t #ExtendCHIP. Meanwhile, Congressional Rs are boarding charter buses to celebrate tax cuts for corporations &amp; CEO’s https://t.co/UfxEZYMLd1
Republicans are saying corporate tax cuts will raise wages. Here’s why that’s not true. https://t.co/bLrAa2jcSm
In 1986, our last major tax reform bill passed Senate 97-3 after 36 days of public hearings over 10 months. 
 
This time? The bill was written completely behind closed doors, no input from Democrats, and is being rushed to meet an artificial, self-imposed deadline. (5/5)
GOP tax bill blows $1.4 trillion hole in our deficit, leaving our children and grandchildren to foot the bill while hamstringing long-term funding for our military, Medicare &amp; Social Security (4/5)
Health care costs for middle class families will go up &amp; number of insured will increase by 13 million. For the sickest Americans, health insurance costs could make coverage simply unattainable (3/5)
This bill overwhelmingly favors the wealthy &amp; corporations with permanent tax cuts that CEO’s admit will go to shareholders  -  not passed down to workers. Since the Senate passed its version, $70 billion of stock buybacks have already been announced. (2/5)
THREAD: The Senate is set to vote on the Republican tax bill tonight. I can’t support this plan b/c it’s not a good deal for Michigan middle class families (1/5)

Even under the rosiest projections, the #GOPTaxPlan would still add over $1 trillion to the national Debt. That is not fiscally conservative, it’s fiscally irresponsible.

Extending #overtime pay to salaried workers earning less than $50,440 will lift families &amp; our economy. Hard work should pay off. #TimeforOT
Outdated rules deny workers the time-and-a-half #overtime pay they deserve. I support @POTUS' plan to strengthen protections. #TimeForOT
#OTD in 1964: LBJ signed Civil Rights Act into law, sweeping bill to prohibit discrimination &amp; enforce desegregation. http://t.co/fsLQ1HMq4E
Nearly 1 in 5 experience some form of mental illness. Helping ID symptoms &amp; address crisis situations is critical: http://t.co/H6oMmOjA8w

Second Chance Act supports critical programs to help ex-offenders find path to a better life after they're released: http://t.co/fYTVwYJDg5
#FairElectionsNow bill establishes voluntary citizen-funded elections for Congressional campaigns, empowering small-dollar donors &amp; voters.
Our campaign finance system is broken. #FairElectionsNow bill will help every American have an equal say, regardless of their net worth.
I'm supporting a plan to reduce the influence of special interests, corporations &amp; mega-donors in our elections: http://t.co/kR2EFG1XcI
ICYMI: @ExImBankUS charter expired at midnight, shutting down a critical resource for Michigan small biz. #ExIm4Jobs http://t.co/FfprUNvxlm

Billions in U.S. exports are at risk. @EximBankUS has bipartisan support &amp; I call on Congress to renew its charter: http://t.co/jcGRvnXFLr
Countries around the world use their own export credit agencies. @EximBankUS helps level the playing field for American biz &amp; workers.
Extremely disappointed that small minority in Congress is blocking renewal of @EximBankUS b/c of ideology. #ExIm4Jobs http://t.co/Hw9p2fGGoI
From Motor City &amp; our Great Lakes to craft beer &amp; pasties, no surprise #PureMichigan is ranked #1: http://t.co/YS4SOwUkGB via @Thrillist

This is a watershed moment in fight for equality, but LGBT Americans still face discrimination &amp; lack many legal protections. More to do.
Thousands of same-sex couples in MI will finally be afforded opportunity to marry who they love including our own April DeBoer &amp; Jayne Rowse
No American should face discrimination b/c of who they love. Proud to have joined my colleagues urging SCOTUS to support marriage equality.
Today’s SCOTUS ruling affirms every American has right to marry who they love &amp; raise a family without fear of being torn apart. #LoveWins

Millions of Americans are finally gaining some measure of security &amp; stability through affordable health coverage. It's clear that #ACAworks
Almost 300K in MI enrolled in the exchange. Today, SCOTUS protected the nearly 80% who count on tax credits for affordable health coverage.
#ACA's intent has always been clear: all Americans should have access to affordable health insurance, regardless of what state they live in.
