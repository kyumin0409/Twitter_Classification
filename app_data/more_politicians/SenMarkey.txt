Jamal Khashoggi’s gruesome and brazen murder is consistent with Mohammed bin Salman's behavior. He has purged dissidents, caused a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and slaughtered civilians.

This new law will improve the nation’s response to this ongoing public health crisis. It’s past time for the Trump administration to join Congress in taking real action to combat this scourge.
Today, important bipartisan opioid legislation was signed into law, which included my provision to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for families and communities impacted by the #OpioidEpidemic.
This new drug is an important, necessary tool to add to our treatment arsenal, but we need to keep focusing on flu prevention. That’s why we need a universal flu vaccine that could be taken only once and provides a lifetime of protection.

The Trump admin’s priority shouldn’t be giving the Saudis “a few more days” to invent a narrative about what happened to #Khashoggi. It should be calling for a truly impartial investigation. A UN-appointed team of criminal investigators would be a good start to finding the truth.

Jamal #Khashoggi will help reveal Mohammed bin Salman for who he really is: an authoritarian, not a reformer. His death, the latest and most brazen in a well-documented history of the Saudis violently repressing dissent, must be a turning point in our relationship.

Today, I want to send a simple but important message to all of those impacted: you are not forgotten. https://t.co/kS3e3MHJBX
We should respect the wishes of Dr. Ford and delay this hearing. The disregard for her well-being and how deeply traumatizing this process must be for her is shameful. Victims deserve to maintain control over their confidentiality and decide who knows their story.
Around 8,000 residents were displaced by the #MVGasFires. Dozens of homes were damaged or destroyed by the explosions and fires. @ColumbiaGasMA owes immediate and robust financial assistance to those affected so they can begin to recover and rebuild from this disaster.
This is patently false. In 1991, the White House directed the FBI to conduct “a full, thorough, and expeditious investigation” into Anita Hill’s allegations against Clarence Thomas. The investigation was completed in three days. https://t.co/8AOrmyPu9w

We cannot let Senate Republicans rush this nomination and sweep under the rug serious and credible allegations of a sexual assault. Some things matter more than politics.
The Senate must allow the FBI to fully investigate Dr. Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh before a hearing is held. And any additional hearings must include other relevant witnesses.
So-called “low-yield” nukes have the potential to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons and increase the risk of entering the U.S. into nuclear war.

Throughout his hearings, Brett Kavanaugh has asked for the benefit of the doubt. On Roe, on William Pryor, on Manuel Miranda. Now, he doesn’t want us to give the benefit of the doubt to the woman accusing him of sexual assault. 

Let’s believe women when they come forward.
It took tremendous courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward. Her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are credible and must be investigated. The Judiciary Committee should not vote on his nomination this week.
The latest from ⁦@NTSB⁩ indicates that alarms went off in a ⁦@ColumbiaGasMA⁩ control room. Were they missed? Ignored? We need a minute-by-minute accounting of what happened before and during the #MVGasFire. We need answers immediately as to how and why this occurred. https://t.co/Z2GjLuhYmf

Before any hearings, the Senate needs to see ALL of Kavanaugh’s records, they need to come from the National Archives, and we need time to review them.

Instead, barely 1% of his documents have been made public and they were cherry-picked by his former deputy. #WhatAreTheyHiding?
Scheduling #Kavanaugh hearings for before midterms is the height of hypocrisy after what the GOP did to Merrick Garland. We shouldn’t have hearings until after Election Day &amp; only if the Senate has had time to review ALL relevant documents, which haven’t even been made available. https://t.co/l0A0nASlQn

Mr. President, if you are so displeased with your DOJ, then you should instruct it to undo the dangerous settlement it reached with Defense Distributed that allows 3D-printable gun blueprints to be posted online. Americans are waiting for you to fix this problem that you created.
.@NRATV likes to say “Nothing Triggers Like Truth”. There’s nothing truthful about @DLoesch's accusations or the NRA’s policies. A better slogan is “Nothing Lies Like The NRA”.
 
#StopDownloadableGuns
And a terrorist organization could make undetectable, downloadable guns from American blueprints to attack American soldiers overseas. Whose side is the NRA on?
Downloadable guns are untraceable and will threaten the safety of law enforcement, who won’t have serial numbers to reference.
You don’t need a $50,000 3D printer to make a gun. Some cost as little as a few hundred dollars, and the technology is becoming cheaper and better every day.
Yes, it’s true prohibited persons are not allowed to own a gun… but that’s exactly why 3D-printable guns are so dangerous. It’s naïve to expect we can prevent prohibited persons like felons from accessing the internet and printing a firearm without a background check.
People can print guns with easily removable metal parts – so a metal detector won’t detect them. Democrats tried to close this loophole in 2013, but Republicans refused at the behest of the @NRA.
“18 USC 922 G Section O” doesn’t exist. Maybe you meant 18 USC 922 (p), the Undetectable Firearms Act? But it has a serious loophole created by technology like 3D printing.

Brett #Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on this case, and his record and judicial philosophy inspire no confidence that he will protect the basic right to health care. His nomination could be the Trump admin’s most harmful health care sabotage effort. We must #StopKavanaugh.
It won’t matter whether you have private or public insurance, conditions like cancer, diabetes, a substance use disorder, or Alzheimer’s. It could mean you are denied coverage or charged unaffordable premiums.
Texas &amp; 19 other states are arguing in the courts that the entire ACA must be ruled invalid. The Trump admin refuses to defend it. If the TX judge sides with these states, it means all of the ACA could be struck down, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

The Trump administration says it met the family reunification deadline, but that’s only because they classified the children whose parents they deported as “ineligible” for reunification. Now, the admin can’t account for the parents and has no timeline to reunite these families.

President Trump prematurely took credit for the remains of 200 American soldiers being returned. That never happened. When it comes to what #NKorea will do, we know we can’t take Kim Jong Un at his word. Now we know we can’t take Trump at his word either.

America and Russia, taken together, possess 10,000+ nuclear weapons. More than enough to destroy the world many, many times over.

Independent journalists and concerned citizens use the internet to expose injustice and speak truth to power. I’m fighting for #NetNeutrality to protect the First Amendment online.
Your internet provider shouldn’t be allowed to decide what news you consume and what voices are heard online. #NetNeutrality is about ensuring that the internet remains an open forum for all. The strength of our democracy depends on it.
Confirming #Kavanaugh to #SCOTUS would be an invitation for anti-choice advocates to intensify their crusade against abortion access, taking them closer to achieving their dream of overturning #RoevWade, and turning back the clock on women’s health freedom and economic security.
Today, the FCC must reject the proposal - supported by special interests like the Kochs - to weaken rules respecting educational TV shows for kids. Just because a family can’t afford Netflix doesn’t mean their kids shouldn’t get educational programming.

Forcing parents to choose between taking their American-born children with them to a dangerous country or being separated and leaving them in America is totally immoral. #FamiliesBelongTogether

Kavanaugh opposes #NetNeutrality. It’s now more important than ever that Congress passes the resolution to save the internet, so #SCOTUS doesn’t get the last word.
In 2017, Brett Kavanaugh argued #NetNeutrality violates the First Amendment rights of *internet providers*, calling it unconstitutional. A free and open internet is the greatest platform for expression of First Amendment rights. We see whose side #Kavanaugh is really on.
Brett #Kavanaugh wrote: “The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility."

The Trump administration already lacks credibility and functionality due to its corruption &amp; incompetence.
Brett Kavanaugh was the only nominee on Trump’s shortlist who has written that a sitting president should not be indicted. It’s not a coincidence that he was selected. #SCOTUSpick #WhatsAtStake
If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, women’s freedom to make decisions about their bodies, reforms to our health care system, the quality of our air and water, and much more will be at risk.
Brett Kavanaugh is a right-wing ideologue selected off the ultra-conservative Federalist Society’s judicial wish list. His record on important issues portends a rubber stamp for an agenda that would move us backwards as a country. The Senate must reject this nominee. #SCOTUSPick

As acting EPA Administrator, Andrew Wheeler will not work for the American people, he will work for the fossil fuel industry. He is every bit as dangerous as Scott Pruitt and we need to fight him just as hard.
This was the secret March 29, 2017 meeting about the plan to "save coal". The photographer who took this was fired.

SOON: I’ll be on @CNN discussing my recent trip to the border and ICE facilities, #SCOTUS and more. Tune in!
One thing became crystal clear after my conversations with those being detained at ICE’s Port Isabel facility: the Trump admin still has literally NO plan or procedures in place for reunifying families. The agencies are as much in the dark as the separated parents themselves.
At the ICE facility I visited, I met a woman from Mexico who has lived here for 18 years. She called 911 after her husband brutally beat her. They turned her over to immigration authorities. She now fears deportation. She has 3 kids.

There should be no agency with this mission.
ICE's activities have become inhumane and brutal. It has turned into a massive deportation army that is experiencing the worst kind of mission creep and strikes fear in the hearts of immigrants who are simply working for a better life. We need to dismantle ICE.
LIVE: As much as I am heartbroken by what I saw at the border during my trip this weekend, I am enraged. I'm in Boston to share what I saw while visiting ICE facilities in TX and what I learned after hearing the stories of the people being detained there: https://t.co/7BGA7TFHRY https://t.co/BDsZw6vbDq
Yesterday, I visited ICE’s Port Isabel Detention Center near the border where mothers and fathers who still haven’t been reunited with their children are being detained. This administration tore these families apart and now it must put them back together. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/9xtCvnOdJu
Secretary Azar claims to be able to find any migrant child in seconds, so this should be easy. Ending the family separation policy was just the beginning of righting this historic injustice. Now the administration must quickly reunify the families.

The clean energy revolution is a blue-collar job revolution. It’s the greatest force for blue-collar job creation in a generation. #ClimateAction
Coal is losing because it can’t compete with renewables in the free market – it’s not conspiracy, it’s competition. In 2016, we created as many jobs in #solar energy as exist in the coal industry today – 50,000. #ClimateAction
The Republicans have a pretty clear agenda when it comes to #ClimateChange and clean energy: Deny, Delay, and Defund. So my approach is Fight, Fight, and Fight. #ClimateAction
If President Trump is waging an assault on clean energy and our climate, then we have to fight back.
 
We have to fight in Congress, in the courts, and in the streets with grassroots activism. #ClimateAction

Overturning #RoevWade would not end abortion, it would just end safe abortion.
A new #SCOTUS justice will shape the law on issues that impact every American for generations. The Senate should not consider ANY Supreme Court nominee until after the midterm elections.
#RoevWade is the law of the land and must remain the law of the land. Supreme Court vacancy or not.
We are now 132 days away from the 2018 election. When Republicans committed to stealing Merrick Garland’s #SCOTUS seat, we were 269 away.
Trump got a weaker deal with fewer commitments than any of his predecessors, and it is no surprise #NorthKorea is already taking advantage of its ambiguity. Congress is ready to step in to tighten the screws even if the President is not. https://t.co/QYsKIo8JZN
The 5-4 #SCOTUS #Janus decision may not be as high-profile as the #MuslimBan but it’s another big win for the right-wing in its decades-long war on the working class. The billionaires who want to lower wages and bust unions scored a major victory today.

A Republican-controlled Senate steals a #SCOTUS seat &amp; confirms an archconservative Justice to a bench that is now enshrining Donald Trump’s legacy of hate with 5-4 decisions like today’s upholding his Muslim ban. This is the end result of a process that starts at the ballot box.

“Nice” internment camps are still internment camps. Children don’t belong there. https://t.co/70p4N3R4uy
The border crisis that Trump created is not over. Thousands of families may be imprisoned indefinitely, possibly in military-style internment camps. Thousands of children remain separated from their parents. 

How we respond will define the character of each and every one of us.
The zero-tolerance policy is an anti-immigrant dragnet. We can only assume this executive order would imprison children in the same correctional facilities as their parents. They will be sleeping in cages instead of cribs.

Families and children don’t belong in jail. Period.
Trump’s executive order doesn’t end the zero-tolerance policy of prosecuting anyone and everyone who crosses the border improperly, it reaffirms it. This evening, I’ll be on the Senate floor speaking out against this cruel policy. Watch here: https://t.co/5VtsjvFSTu
The weakening of California’s #NetNeutrality bill shows what the forces we are facing are capable of. Every state deserves gold standard rules. That’s why the House of Reps should pass my CRA resolution immediately to reinstate net neutrality nationally.

The executive order doesn't end the zero-tolerance policy that created this crisis. In fact, the President now wants to detain parents and children together indefinitely, and contemplates DoD building internment camps to house them. This is no solution to a problem Trump created.
Declaring June National Ocean Month is a nice sheen on Trump’s ocean policy, but between opening up 90% of our coasts to offshore drilling and now repealing the #NationalOceanPolicy, his admin is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill.

Here’s what’s not confusing. Robert Mueller’s investigation has thus far resulted in 19 people being indicted or pleading guilty. Mueller is a top-tier investigator. If there’s crime, he’s going to find it. It’s not surprising that Trump is trying to undermine our justice system.
Trump accuses those investigating Russian meddling in U.S. elections of meddling in U.S. elections &amp; still hasn’t said the same about the Russians... who meddled in U.S. elections.

You can't begin a negotiation with NK by advocating for the worst conclusion for its leader &amp; expect that negotiation to succeed. President Trump did little to disavow this declaration from his advisors &amp; has approached this summit from the outset with naivete and inconsistency.
When @VP Pence and John Bolton declared that Libya was a model for persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, they confirmed Kim Jong Un’s deep-seated fears that the upcoming negotiations would be nothing more than a tactic to invade &amp; disarm his country.
I urge President Trump not to continue with the kind of threatening rhetoric that he used today in his letter, as it only serves to enflame and destabilize the region. While the challenges to a lasting agreement with North Korea are great, we should not abandon diplomacy.

https://t.co/Ml9COtfBXk
America is exporting 2.5 million barrels of oil a day to China and elsewhere while we import that exact same amount from OPEC and the Middle East. That only makes sense to the #BigOil executives getting rich while American families are getting turned upside down at the pump.
OPEC, Russia, &amp; others have been conspiring to boost oil prices to hurt Americans. I’m introducing legislation that requires President Trump to negotiate with these nations to put an end to this cartel manipulating markets &amp; take action against any country that refuses to stop.

Tech underpins 34% of jobs in Massachusetts. In 2017, 70% of tech leaders in #MA said they plan to increase workforce in the next 12 months. Repealing #NetNeutrality puts all of that in jeopardy.

Simply put, my CRA resolution will put #NetNeutrality back on the books because in 2018, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a RIGHT.

#OneMoreVote
Third, the CRA will prevent ISPs from setting up internet fast and slow lanes. ISPs won’t be able to charge large websites for access to an internet fast lane while websites that can’t afford the internet EZ pass will load at a bumper to bumper pace.
Second, the CRA will ensure ISPs cannot throttle, or slow down, a website of their choosing, especially a competitor.
First, the CRA will protect websites from being entirely blocked by ISPs (internet service providers). That means an ISP cannot block a video chat service, just so you’ll use their own service. And it will prevent ISPs from blocking a website with a contrary political viewpoint.
Next week’s vote on my resolution to *fully* restore #NetNeutrality will be the most important vote for the internet in the history of the United States Senate. 

Here's what the CRA resolution means for you:

The American people are paying close attention to who is fighting for them and who is sitting on the sidelines.


This vote on #NetNeutrality is coming, and when it does, it will be crystal clear who is protecting corporate buddies and who is fighting for everyday Americans.
Don’t be fooled by the voices that say this is all doom and gloom &amp; that the ISPs would NEVER block or throttle content. Mark my words, without #NetNeutrality, these are not alarmist &amp; hypothetical harms. They are real, &amp; without #NetNeutrality they may become the new normal.
The fight to save #NetNeutrality is a fight for the most powerful platform in the history of the planet, the internet. And in 2018, access to a free and open internet is a right, not a privilege.

The reason why the @realDonaldTrump administration repealed #NetNeutrality is simple: it sides with the rich and the powerful first, and consistently, without fail, puts everyday Americans last.

But today, the internet is fighting back.

#OneMoreVote #SaveTheInternet
#NetNeutrality ensures that those with the brightest ideas, not merely the deepest pockets, can thrive in the 21st century economy.

https://t.co/eWjV83xYQm
Leaving the #IranDeal frees Iran to immediately re-start nuclear activities, encourages its rivals to pursue their own nuclear weapons programs, risks a calamitous military conflict in the Middle East, and bolsters Iran's hardliners.

@realDonaldTrump has made a terrible mistake.
Tomorrow, the petition that allows @SenateDems to force a vote on my resolution to save #NetNeutrality will be officially filed.

He’s opposed to the #IranDeal, the Paris Climate Accord, and advocates military action when diplomacy should be our primary response. My opposition to Pompeo's nomination is because he cannot credibly fulfill his duties as the nation’s chief diplomat. #StopPompeo
Pompeo has said that he might bring back waterboarding. A man who has said those who have carried out such actions were “not torturers, they are patriots” won't be able to credibly convey to gov'ts with histories of human rights abuses that these actions are reprehensible.
Pompeo has suggested homosexuality is a “perversion.” At the CIA, he cancelled a Pride Month event that featured an appearance by the parents of a young man beaten, tortured, and left to die on account of his sexual orientation. He cannot credibly represent LGBTQ Americans.
Mike Pompeo once called an Indian-American political opponent “just another turban topper we don’t need in Congress or any political office that deals with the U.S. constitution...” With a viewpoint like that, he cannot credibly represent Indian Americans.

We must fight back – with education, with urgency, with the facts – with ACTION. We must take the climate deniers and their fossil fuel funders to task for their opposition to the clean energy opportunities that could win the battle against climate change.

The Koch brothers aren’t doing this alone. They have found their most ardent ally in their campaign to attack climate science in @realDonaldTrump. Throughout the Trump admin, there is a concerted effort to deny and defund the science of climate change in an unprecedented way.
The first year of the Trump administration has been a Koch brothers’ wish list – and they are popping their champagne bottles all the way to the bank.
Just last week, the Koch brothers bragged to donors in a report that they were responsible for @realDonaldTrump’s policies: repealing the Clean Power Plan, attacking public lands, leaving the Paris Climate Accord and tax giveaways to #BigOil.

https://t.co/9tMIM97wxX
It has been 8 years since the BP oil spill, the worst environmental disaster in American history. This anniversary is a reminder why we must fight @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to hand over nearly all of our coastlines to the highest fossil fuel bidder for oil drilling.
Momentum is on our side, but time isn’t. Help us #SaveTheInternet by making your voices heard NOW. Members of Congress need to know that there will be a price to pay for being on the wrong side of internet history.
With #OneMoreVote in the Senate, we can vote to reverse @realDonaldTrump's attack on the internet. The House can do the same with 218 votes. It currently has 160.

But we won’t get those votes unless lawmakers hear from people who care about protecting the future of the internet.
3 days from now - Monday, April 23rd - @realDonaldTrump’s FCC will officially repeal #NetNeutrality. That means Charter can start slowing download speeds, Verizon can start charging you more, and Comcast can start blocking any content it wants.

But this fight is far from over…
For 40 years before 2015, oil companies were banned from exporting American crude to protect our nat'l security and consumers. Now they export 1.5M barrels of oil a day and gas prices are up nearly 20%.

If he wants to put “America first” the crude oil ban should be reinstated. https://t.co/kkhlnjpo6H

With the nomination of Mike Pompeo and the appointment of John Bolton, it is clear @realDonaldTrump wants a war cabinet. 
 
The Senate shouldn’t give it to him. 
 
The President’s cabinet shouldn’t be full of yes-men and warmongers who enable his worst impulses.
Mike Pompeo defended the CIA’s use of torture, voted against the Violence Against Women Act, &amp; proposed anti-LGBTQ laws. His career is a laundry list of extremism.

America’s top diplomat should embody America’s values, not defend torture, promote division &amp; ignore human rights.
Commissioner @MClyburnFCC has served the American people with integrity, distinction, and compassion during her nearly nine years at the Commission. She will be deeply missed.
Muslim Americans. LGBTQ Americans. Even my friend @JohnKerry. Mike Pompeo demeaned them all and is unfit to serve as our chief diplomat. That’s why I will vote NO on his nomination to be Secretary of State.
For @realDonaldTrump’s administration, “energy dominance” is just code for “drill, baby, drill”. Instead of using our coasts to drill for oil, we should be harnessing them for #cleanenergy creation. #ProtectOurCoast

No wall is going to stop fentanyl from coming into the United States. 13th century technology isn’t the solution to a 21st century problem, 21st century technology is.
Using high-tech, handheld chemical screening devices - technology that is home grown and built by Massachusetts companies - @CBP agents can quickly detect, identify, and seize illicit drugs like fentanyl on the spot.
That is why I introduced the INTERDICT Act. It provides high-tech equipment and other scientific resources to @CBP to catch illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United States, mainly from China and Mexico. I was able to secure more than $65 million to implement my law.
.@CBP fentanyl seizures in 2013: 2 lbs. In 2017: 1,485 lbs.

That’s a 74,000% increase &amp; enough fentanyl seized in 2017 to kill nearly every man, woman, &amp; child in America.

Congress has spent more time trying to cut Medicaid than it has finding solutions to the #OpioidCrisis. Medicaid is the #1 source of funding for substance use disorder treatment in the U.S. Cutting would be like throwing gasoline on an already raging fire. #RxSummit

But there is so much more we need to do. That’s why I’m introducing the Opioid MILESTONES Act. This bill will require the federal government to set tangible benchmarks for how we are addressing the #OpioidCrisis in our country and measure progress on key objectives every year.
The spending package also included funding for legislation that I authored with @SenRubioPress called the INTERDICT Act. This bill equips our border patrol agents with advanced technological tools and resources to help stanch the flow of fentanyl across our borders. #RxSummit

Gun dealers who turn a blind eye to middle-men buying hundreds of weapons to sell on the streets use PLCAA to avoid legal liability. No one should be able to profit from gun deaths. Repeal PLCAA now.
Bars can be liable for accidents when they negligently sell alcohol to people they have reason to think will drive drunk. But under PLCAA, gun makers and dealers can escape accountability for similarly negligent conduct. The gun industry does not deserve special privileges.
In 2008, a gun shop owner was sued for allegedly selling a firearm to a fugitive off the books. The fugitive used this gun to kill a random bystander 2 days later. 

Despite repeated violations of federal gun laws, the seller was found to be immune from liability under PLCAA.
When other businesses are harmfully negligent, they can be held legally responsible. When it’s the gun industry, there are no consequences because the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act broadly shields them from liability.

We must repeal PLCAA now.

7. Ban assault weapons

In Massachusetts, the sale and possession of assault weapons have been permanently banned since 2004. 

Every state should do this.
6. Get the data

One of my bills, S.834, will give the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention $60 million to fund gun violence research. Research has effectively halted over the past two decades because of a Republican appropriations rider called the Dickey amendment.
5. Store guns safely

In Massachusetts, gun owners are required to keep their guns safely secured in a locked container or equipped with a tamper-resistant lock.

Every state should do this.
4. Regulate dealers

#MA is considering a law to require private sales to be completed at licensed dealers. In MA, dealers are required to verify a purchaser’s license, conduct a background check for every sale, and maintain a record of all sales to share with law enforcement.
3. Protect consumers

In Massachusetts, manufacturing, safety and marketing standards for guns are strictly regulated. 

Every state should do this.
2. Protect the vulnerable

Massachusetts is considering enacting an Extreme Risk Protective Order law to allow families and police to remove guns from high-risk homes. 

Every state should do this.
1. Empower local communities

In Massachusetts, if anyone wants to purchase a gun, they must obtain a license. Obtaining a license requires approval from the local chief of police, which typically includes an in-person interview. 

Every state should do this.
If every state had Massachusetts’s gun laws, we could save thousands of lives. My bill, the MASS Act – Making America Safe and Secure – incentivizes states to adopt similar gun laws. The @BostonGlobe outlined 7 steps we should take to reduce gun violence:

John Bolton supports proactively bombing Iran and conducting a first strike on North Korea without provocation. Appointing him to be Nat Sec Advisor is a grave danger to the American people and a clear message from @realDonaldTrump that he is gearing up for military conflict.
With the appointments of Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, @realDonaldTrump is successfully lining up his war cabinet. Bolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War. We cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict.
In his @Recode interview w/ @KaraSwisher, Zuckerberg doesn't accept that the buck stops with him on the #CambridgeAnalytica scandal. He is accountable for FB’s role in this breach. That means he has the obligation to testify before Congress, not another company lawyer or staffer. https://t.co/zp1L3xY6mz

Victims deserve justice. Perpetrators deserve consequences.

You need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath.

We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our allies to say—unequivocally—that we did everything in our power without resorting to armed conflict.
Today marks the 15th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Although the current situation we face with NK is not identical to the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003, the NK situation is, in fact, worse. 

We must learn the appropriate lessons regarding the use of military force.
But we must be clear. There is no military solution to the #NorthKorea crisis.
I am concerned that if these talks do not go well, @realDonaldTrump will be able to claim that we tried economic pressure and we tried diplomacy, but neither has worked. He will be left with the conclusion that the only approach remaining is military force.
Despite his recent announcement that he would accept a meeting with Kim Jong Un, @realDonaldTrump has systematically undermined the effectiveness of the very agency – the U.S. Department of State – that he will need to make talks successful.
More than a year into the Trump administration, we still don’t have:
-a U.S. ambassador to South Korea
-a confirmed assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs 
-a Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues 
-a Sanctions Coordinator

Let’s return the United States of America to the forefront of statecraft, allowing our diplomats to advance our interests without risking a frivolous loss of life.
Talks are not synonymous with concessions. Talks backed by targeted pressure and stronger alliances is the path pursued by countries that are strong, confident, and wise. While the drumbeat of war, on the other hand, is the sound of fear and insecurity.
Congress must demand that the Trump administration exhaust all diplomatic and economic options in #NorthKorea short of war. Our pressure on North Korea must be combined with simultaneous and direct engagement with the regime.
We should be open to talks with #NorthKorea. But the State Department is already alarmingly under-staffed to handle the threats from the regime. And we still don’t have a U.S. ambassador to South Korea – more than a year into @realDonaldTrump's administration.
We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our allies to say that we did everything in our power to curb #NorthKorea’s dangerous behavior without resorting to armed conflict.

Let's put our money where our mouth is &amp; put $60M toward gun violence research at the CDC.

We have 56 legislative days to #SaveTheInternet. 

If you’re tired of the @GOP siding with corporate interests over ordinary Americans, join me in fighting to keep the internet free and open for all. Ask your Senators if they support my CRA to save #NetNeutrality. 

#OneMoreVote https://t.co/p6iWvKsNY3
The entire #MA Congressional delegation – Democrats and Republicans alike – is united in fighting @realDonaldTrump’s offshore drilling proposal. We sent a letter to @SecretaryZinke asking that the Commonwealth be exempted from this plan that could devastate our iconic coast. https://t.co/5ZKmaR7t1t
Trump is obsessed with energy industries of the past.

His offshore drilling plan opens our coasts to the oil industry of the 20th century.

What's his next brilliant plan for US energy dominance?

Steam engines?

Whale oil?

Candle making?

It’s time for energy of the future.
Rare diseases aren't actually that rare - 1 in 10 Americans live with one. On #RareDiseaseDay, let's recommit to investing in research for new treatments and cures and protecting quality, affordable health care so individuals with rare diseases can access the care they need.
Today, the NIAID released a strategic plan to develop a universal #flu vaccine. I will fight to secure the funding the NIAID needs so that one day, the flu will be relegated to the history books.

ONE YEAR AGO TODAY. Now we know this wasn't true because @realDonaldTrump actively sabotaged the Senate’s bipartisan immigration bill just a couple weeks ago.
 
Donald Trump may say he's a deal-maker, but his actions prove he's a hardliner.

https://t.co/ko01u9BiOD
On #NetNeutrality, it’s clear @SenateGOP is listening to corporate lobbyists and not their constituents. Because if they were, there would only be one choice: support my resolution to save #NetNeutrality.  

#OneMoreVote https://t.co/cr6fMidBpO
The Communist Party of China arrested the relatives of U.S. @RadioFreeAsia journalists in retaliation for reporting on the #Uyghur ethnic minority and China’s use of big data for preventive policing in #Xinjiang.
 
https://t.co/PTOdtNUkOe
It gives me hope that companies like @DICKS understand that preventing mass shootings is more important than money.
 
The same cannot be said for members of Congress who do the bidding of the @NRA and refuse to support even commonsense gun safety legislation.
We are coming for our #NetNeutrality and we are not going to stop.

#OneMoreVote https://t.co/FKOOYtUaYi
Skeptics say that the #NetNeutrality fight is all just political posturing.

To them I say, this isn’t just a months-long campaign. It’s a movement for the gamers, the grandparents, the gearheads, the geeks, the GIF-makers, the genealogists, &amp; Generations X, Y, &amp; Z.

#OneMoreVote
This is the resolution that can save #NetNeutrality. Today, I officially introduced it.

With #OneMoreVote, we can pass it in the Senate. https://t.co/wHbSppB5DD
#NorthKorea is making a mockery of the international effort to stem weapons proliferation. Instead of playing whack-a-mole with North Korea, the Trump administration needs to cut off crude oil to North Korea to help compel the regime to negotiate.
https://t.co/kR6XCN34EW
The fight to save #NetNeutrality is not limited to the halls of Congress. 

✅ Just today 76 mayors signed a letter opposing the repeal 

✅ 25+ state legislatures are considering net neutrality legislation 

✅ 23 state AGs have filed suit to reinstate the rules

#OneMoreVote
Do you see your Senators?

If not, they need to know how you feel about #NetNeutrality TODAY.

#OneMoreVote https://t.co/PK6Xpd6wvM
Sometime this spring, @SenateDems will force a vote on the CRA to save #NetNeutrality. With #OneMoreVote, we will pass it and the fight will move to the House where @USRepMikeDoyle's companion resolution has 150 co-sponsors. 

We are so close, but now we must fight even harder.
83% of Americans disapprove of @AjitPaiFCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality, including 4 out of 5 Republicans! I implore all of my colleagues in the House and Senate to listen to your constituents, and join us in fighting to #SaveTheInternet.

The clock is ticking. https://t.co/evCGFH2akZ
Simply put, my CRA resolution will put #NetNeutrality back on the books.

#OneMoreVote
Third, the CRA will prevent ISPs from setting up internet fast and slow lanes.   ISPs won’t be able to charge large websites for access to an internet fast lane while websites that can’t afford the internet EZ pass will load at a bumper to bumper pace. 

#OneMoreVote
Second, the CRA will ensure ISPs cannot throttle, or slow down, a website of their choosing, especially a competitor.

#OneMoreVote
First, the CRA will protect websites from being entirely blocked by ISPs (internet service providers). That means an ISP cannot block a video chat service, just so you’ll use their own service. And it will prevent ISPs from blocking a website with a contrary political viewpoint.
Today, with the entire Senate Democratic caucus, I am officially introducing a CRA - Congressional Review Act - resolution that will *fully* restore #NetNeutrality and we only need #OneMoreVote to pass it in the Senate.

Here's what the CRA means for you:
Make no mistake, when it comes to #NetNeutrality, we are truly locked in an historic battle. A battle for who controls the internet: the American people, or corporate interests. 

#OneMoreVote #SavetheInternet
The reason why the @realDonaldTrump administration repealed #NetNeutrality is simple: it sides with the rich and the powerful first, and consistently, without fail, puts everyday Americans last.

But today, the internet is fighting back.

#OneMoreVote #SaveTheInternet
The internet is for everybody, not just Verizon, Charter, AT&amp;T, and Comcast.  

But don’t agonize, organize! Keep making noise! Keep speaking out! We just need #OneMoreVote.
 
#NetNeutrality is our 21st century right and we will fight to protect it.
When we vote on my CRA to restore #NetNeutrality, @SenateGOP will face a choice: stand with hardworking American families for whom the internet is essential, or stand with the big money corporate interests and their army of lobbyists.

#OneMoreVote
Today, we are officially introducing the CRA resolution, which would reverse the @FCC’s actions and restore #NetNeutrality. 
 
And when we take this vote on the Senate floor, every one of my colleagues will have to answer this simple question: Whose side are you on? #OneMoreVote
LIVE: Today is the #NetNeutrality National Day of Action. @SenateDems and @HouseDemocrats are joining forces with innovators, entrepreneurs, students and advocates to fight for #OneMoreVote for my CRA to #SaveTheInternet.

TUNE IN HERE: https://t.co/7BGA7TFHRY https://t.co/j1LdO6KDIu

Diplomacy plus continued pressure - including crude oil sanctions on China - is our best chance of reducing the North Korean threat.

.@realDonaldTrump says that if new sanctions don't work, "Phase 2" could be "very rough." Let's be clear: these new sanctions do not exhaust our non-military options with #NorthKorea. Phase 1 should cut off Chinese crude oil. And Phase 2 should never include nuclear annihilation.
Presented without comment:

At #CPAC the @NRA just gave @AjitPaiFCC the “Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire” award (a "Kentucky handmade long gun") for his work to repeal #NetNeutrality...

Gun violence is a public health emergency. But the @CDCgov isn’t allowed to research it due to an @NRA-backed amendment called the "Dickey rider". @SecAzar said he supports my efforts to lift the research ban, but he needs to be held to his word.

U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services is erasing "Nation of Immigrants" from its mission statement.

@realDonaldTrump can rewrite a mission statement, but he can't rewrite history. We ARE a nation of immigrants and that will never change no matter the hate Trump tries to sow.
After #Parkland, @realDonaldTrump claims he’s making mental health a priority, but he wants to gut Medicaid, which:
-covers ~20% of adults with mental illness
-accounts for ~25% of all spending on mental health services
-is the single largest payer for mental health services
Today, the @FCC picked an expiration date for #NetNeutrality. We have just 60 legislative days to #SaveTheInternet, but we’re so close to victory in the Senate. Help @SenateDems find just one more Republican Senator to support my CRA. #OneMoreVote https://t.co/ScXg7HIq6i
My legislation eliminates the “Dickey rider” that bans the CDC from studying #GunViolence and puts $60m toward research. In the wake of the #Parkland tragedy, some Republicans like @SecAzar are voicing support, but we need action now. Today I asked @HHSgov how Congress can help. https://t.co/aHQ0sSDIBC
Not only is @realDonaldTrump putting virtually all of our coasts and oceans up for sale, he’s pawning them off to #BigOil with big discounts.

60 legislative days from now, the free and open Internet will be on life support UNLESS we find one more Republican Senator to support my CRA to save #NetNeutrality. We have a real shot at victory in the Senate, but we have to keep the pressure on the @SenateGOP.
Wayne LaPierre’s speech at #CPAC made one thing clear: leaders need to stop listening to Wayne LaPierre and the @NRA &amp; start listening to the voices that actually matter - those of the students of #Parkland &amp; all of the people rising up &amp; demanding real action on #gunviolence.
The @NRA must be thrilled @realDonaldTrump’s “solution” to school shootings is to sell more guns to teachers.
 
To prevent mass shootings, we don't need laws that put guns in the classroom, we need laws that keep guns out of the hands of killers.
The clock starts ticking TODAY. @AjitPaiFCC just triggered a timeline that will culminate in a Senate vote on my CRA to save #NetNeutrality. We now have only 60 legislative days to find one more vote. Is your Senator on the right side of history? https://t.co/oW3TzE6s00
We cannot condemn future generations to a world where mass shootings are normal. But that’s exactly what we’ll do if we fail to act on gun violence. I’m inspired by these young people and I agree with them – we need #GunReformNow.

https://t.co/aZPel7gFMJ
This was a missed opportunity but we can’t lose focus on what is important: North Korean engineers are scrambling at this very moment to perfect a nuclear-armed ICBM. We need tougher sanctions on NK’s enablers to help bring about peaceful denuclearization.

84 kids have died from the #flu this year. A universal vaccine could have helped prevent that. With the current flu shot effectiveness at just 36%, we need to pass my legislation that puts $1 billion into research for a universal flu vaccine.

Banning bump stocks is a positive step, but it’s too late for the victims in Las Vegas. And it wouldn’t have saved any of the victims in #Parkland. The goal shouldn’t be just revising our gun laws after massacres, it should be real action to prevent them from ever happening.
To the students and families of Parkland, of Newtown, of Aurora, of Orlando, Las Vegas and so many others – I am with you. I thank you. And I will fight for you.
https://t.co/GZQ6ozh1KW
We should immediately repeal the PLCAA so we can hold the gun industry accountable for their wrongdoing and provide justice for their victims. #GunReformNow
In 2005, the @NRA successfully lobbied for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. It shields gun manufacturers from being sued by victims of their wrongdoing. Congress has done more to protect gun manufacturers from lawsuits than to protect children from mass shootings.
.@realDonaldTrump is trying to curry favor with the Saudi Crown Prince by trading U.S. security interests for commercial ones. Any #nuclear cooperation with the Saudis must include the highest non-proliferation and safeguard standards – a gold-standard!

https://t.co/q7NrtH4QHU
These are sensible steps that most Americans support. I hope that this movement of young people standing up and saying “enough is enough” will push Republican leaders to once and for all take meaningful action on gun violence. #GunReformNow
Let’s repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act — or P.L.C.A.A. and take away the gun manufacturers’ immunity from civil liability.
Let’s close the loophole that allows domestic abusers to buy guns.
Let’s close the gun show loophole, as well as the one that allows someone on the terrorist watch list to purchase a weapon.
Let’s pass legislation that ensures there is a background check on ALL gun purchases.
Let’s ban these military-style assault weapons like the AR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass casualties on civilians. These are weapons that belong in combat, not in our communities.
Let’s end the research ban on the @CDCgov so our scientists can study the causes and prevention of gun violence. It is time we treat gun violence like the public-health emergency it is.
.@realDonaldTrump, his Republican allies and the @NRA want us to think there is not much that can be done to prevent mass shootings like #Parkland. #WeCallBS. Here are some reasonable, commonsense actions we can and must take to achieve #GunReformNow:
LIVE: We need immediate action on gun safety. I’m with @HarvardChanSPH and @WeSayItsNotOkay calling for reasonable, commonsense steps like an assault weapons ban and an end to the ban on gun violence research at the @CDCgov. #GunReformNow. Watch here: https://t.co/7BGA7TFHRY https://t.co/IPVO4zqQoR
Young people are pleading for real action like an assault weapons ban and universal background checks that will prevent the next #Parkland, not a modest step like this. My full statement: https://t.co/3W15Qdn1DT
This is nothing but lip service from @WhiteHouse. If this one bill is all the White House wants done legislatively to address the tragedy in #Parkland, then @realDonaldTrump has already failed.

We cannot let Trump and his allies off the hook this easy.

https://t.co/xNsi1t1XzX
In the wake of the tragedy at #Parkland, I’m inspired by the youngest people in our country rising up &amp; leading a crusade against the @NRA. They’ve had enough empty talk. Our children are demanding action on gun violence &amp; the adults in power must listen.

I believe that in the 21st century, our national security would be better served by funding education, not annihilation. If you agree, share how you think we could better spend this money.
So far, $1.8 billion in contracts has already been awarded to build this weapon. With that money, we could double the budgets of the National Endowment for the Arts AND the National Endowment for the Humanities.
The Pentagon also thinks it will cost $6 billion to operate and sustain the missile fleet over its expected life. With $6 billion, we could build an opioid treatment facility in EVERY COUNTY in America.
The Pentagon projects the cost to acquire the new missile fleet at about $11 billion. With $11 billion, we could hire 190,000 new teachers, enroll 1 million new children into Head Start, or provide nearly 5 billion additional free or reduced lunches for disadvantaged students.
THREAD: This is a nuclear-tipped cruise missile. Defense contractors are developing a new one called the LRSO (Long Range Stand Off weapon). We have sunk BILLIONS into it. Billions more will be spent unless we cancel it. I have some ideas on how we could better spend that money: https://t.co/peu8yVjsFR

These Russian conspirators must be prosecuted and Robert Mueller's investigation must be protected. #TrumpRussia
We now have proof that this was a well-funded, well-organized, well-executed Russian operation to interfere with our election and elect @realDonaldTrump. Every American should understand the magnitude of these charges, the President most of all. There can be no more denying.
When the history of Russia's interference in our elections is written, there will be a before and after today’s indictments.
Our best and brightest need resources if they are going to overcome the challenge of developing a universal #flu vaccine. My Flu Vaccine Act will inject a desperately needed $1 billion into their research efforts. 

https://t.co/a1GViaQeJP
Today HHS @SecAzar said he will support @CDCgov research into gun violence, something that’s been prevented since 1996 by a pro-gun lobby Republican appropriations rider.
 
Sec. Azar should commit to what he said &amp; get researchers working NOW so we can prevent the next #Parkland. https://t.co/kzZFhghkiu
Since 1996, a Republican appropriations rider has banned the @CDCgov from researching gun violence because the @NRA fears what scientific studies will show. We should pass my legislation that ends this ban &amp; study gun violence like the public health crisis it is. #GunReformNow
LIVE: The #flu is reaching epidemic levels across the country.

Americans are living in fear that their community could be the next #Parkland. If Trump cannot muster the courage to call for measures that are supported by overwhelming majorities, he should know that Americans will hold him &amp; everyone that holds hands with the NRA accountable.
.@realDonaldTrump will soon speak in the wake of the #Parkland massacre. If he's at all serious about confronting the gun violence epidemic, he will take this opportunity to call for commonsense #gunsafety measures including universal background checks &amp; an assault weapons ban.

Heads of @CIA, @FBI, @NSAGov, @ODNIgov and @NGA_GEOINT all agree that Russia will continue to interfere in our elections. Yet @realDonaldTrump refuses to enforce new sanctions nor explain why. We shouldn’t need a Kremlinologist to explain the @WhiteHouse’s decisions.
No one knows what spies will do better than other spies, and ours say Russia will continue to try to meddle in our 2018 and 2020 elections. @realDonaldTrump should listen to them and enforce the sanctions on Russia that Congress passed 517-5.

Health and Human Services -$17.9B (21%)
 
After the #GOPTaxScam, we know this isn’t about deficits &amp; “fiscal responsibility”, it’s about eviscerating vital programs.
Today, @realDonaldTrump unveiled his infrastructure plan while releasing a budget that cuts funding for the Department of Transportation by 19%. That’s a blueprint for a highway to hell no.

I will not stop fighting for these #Dreamers, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. #DreamActNow
America is a nation of immigrants built and fueled by communities coming to our shores to create better lives. We take in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. Our country is enriched by diversity &amp; we believe that the American Dream is not determined by where you were born.
Right here, right now we could pass a bill to protect these young immigrants. But instead, the Republicans decided to use #Dreamers as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations. This is shameful. It is immoral. It is a national tragedy.
#Dreamers are young people like Estefany, who study, who serve, who work, and who live next-door to us every single day. They are our friends, our neighbors, and our loved ones. They are not “too lazy”. They are not “bad hombres”. They are some of our best and our brightest.
As Estefany put it, “After so many tears and sleepless nights, it felt like all my hard work was being thrown away.” But Estefany is a fighter and she is not giving up on her college education or a career. I know she will succeed if she is just given the chance.
Estefany is now attending UMass Boston, where she is pursuing a degree in International Relations and a minor in public policy. So, it sounds like a happy ending. But sadly, it is not. On Estefany’s first day as a freshman at UMass Boston, @realDonaldTrump repealed #DACA.
Her work ethic and desire to deserve her family’s sacrifices were what motivated Estefany and got her through the many hardships that come with being undocumented – fear, uncertainty, anxiety.
Estefany was overjoyed to be reunited with her mother, who had come to the United States a few years before the rest of the family. Estefany was grateful for the opportunity. she was given and did not want to squander it.
She came to the United States at nine years old to escape violence in El Salvador. She was brought here by her grandmother along with her two sisters and a baby cousin.
I would like take a moment to speak about one of these Massachusetts #Dreamers who benefited from #DACA. Her name is Estefany.
#DACA created security and opportunity for hundreds of thousands of young #Dreamers, allowing them to live and work in our great nation without the threat of deportation. So what DACA really stands for is Deserving A Chance in America.
#Dreamers know no other home than the United States. And many of them have spent their lives in limbo, identifying as Americans but lacking legal status and under the constant threat of being sent back to countries that are completely foreign to them.
LIVE: In every way but their immigration status, #Dreamers are Americans and they deserve a chance in America. I’m on the @DSenFloor fighting for a #DreamActNow and asking my colleagues to do the same. WATCH HERE: https://t.co/7BGA7TFHRY https://t.co/Px7SaVqgdl

We have a big choice to make: a future of clean coasts and #cleanenergy. Or a future of the rigs, drills and spills of #BigOil. My colleagues and I will not stop until this offshore drilling plan is blocked and we #ProtectOurCoast once and for all.
Instead of using our coasts to drill for oil, we should be harnessing them for #cleanenergy creation. The offshore wind industry has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs up and down the East Coast. And there is no such thing as a tragic wind spill. #ProtectOurCoast
We are exporting more than 1.5 million barrels a day of crude to China and other nations. #BigOil is now asking our coastal states to bear all of the environmental risk of offshore drilling so that they can send even more oil to China to get a higher price. #ProtectOurCoast

About to join @msnbc @AriMelber to talk protections for our #Dreamers and the need for long-term funding for community health centers, the #opioidcrisis, and disaster aid. Tune in.
The futures and families of #Dreamers will not be assured by a promise from Republican leadership. We need a long-term budget proposal that includes real protections for our Dreamers, not a short-term IOU.
I remain deeply skeptical of any short-term budget agreement that relies on the good faith commitment of @realDonaldTrump. A budgetary vision without funding is a hallucination.
I cannot support a budget deal that falls so far short of fulfilling our moral and Constitutional obligation to the American people.
This is the choice the @GOP is offering:
 
Abandon #Dreamers and allow millions of young Americans to be deported, or, abandon millions of sick, low-income children and let #CHIP go unfunded.

A budget without funding to fight the #OpioidCrisis will leave families without hope and help. We owe it to them to fight as hard as possible to get the funding they need. I won’t vote for a CR that doesn’t include it. https://t.co/dZx7aVzKYH
A health care tear-down, an Internet slow-down &amp; now a government shut-down are symptoms of a larger political paralysis in D.C. The @GOP’s inability to govern actually serves their ultimate goal - to incapacitate the government. We're working hard to stop that. #TrumpShutdown

The @GOP isn’t even pretending to govern with any amount of humanity. Their strategy is to turn Americans against one another with this kind of hostage negotiation. I refuse to accept the Sophie’s choice they are offering. We need to fund #CHIP AND protect our #Dreamers. https://t.co/HgLVPoIhSr
SOON: I'm hitting the @DSenFloor to talk about why I cannot vote for a CR that includes no certainty for DREAMers and no funding for community health centers, #PuertoRico disaster aid, the #OpioidCrisis and #CHIP. WATCH: https://t.co/cZalSUSAzs
They were busier giving tax breaks to the wealthy than health care to kids. This is a budget crisis of their own making.
THIS disgusting attempt to leverage #CHIP is the reason the @GOP has kept millions of low-income families in a state of panic for months. They could've brought up #CHIP at any time. Every Dem would have voted for it. Worried parents &amp; sick children have suffered… for this tweet. https://t.co/iqH1STkR3E

My CRA to restore #NetNeutrality is ONE Republican away from having the votes to pass in the Senate.

#NetNeutrality is good for free speech, democracy, small businesses, entrepreneurs. 83% of Americans support it. If the @SenateGOP votes to kill it, you have to wonder who they really work for: their constituents or their corporate cronies?
.@SenateDems are standing with the millions of Americans who have raised their voices in favor of #NetNeutrality. The Internet should belong to YOU, not the @GOP's corporate cronies.
Every Senate Democrat has now signed on to my CRA to restore #NetNeutrality. We’re all in for a free and open Internet.

The risk of miscalculation and war is far too high and @realDonaldTrump’s tweets have made things worse. We need to focus more on getting back to the negotiating table and less on reckless rhetoric.
A false alarm can lead to war. If the world’s most advanced nuclear power can make a mistake like this, imagine the susceptibility of North Korea’s warning system to potentially deadly errors. 
https://t.co/xSl702Z4At
Remember: “low-yield” nuclear weapons are what leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We should put a full stop to this low-yield plan because @realDonaldTrump should have fewer, not more, nuclear weapons.
Reports about the Nuclear Posture Review are disturbing. @realDonaldTrump wants more nukes + more ways to use them, which = lower threshold for nuclear war. https://t.co/SfqJqlwgtJ
I’m pleased the U.S. will, for now, continue to honor our commitments under the Iran deal. But @realDonaldTrump must stop threatening to go back on our word.

#MA’s coastal economy generates tens of billions of dollars each year. If #offshoredrilling is too dangerous for Florida, it’s too dangerous for Mass, and every single mile of coastline that would be opened by the Trump admin’s reckless plan.

"By 2027, the #GOPTaxScam will raise taxes on over 53 percent of American households. And at the same time, a full 83% of the tax cuts will flow to the top 1% of Americans."
“The American people are waking up to the fact that they have been sold a bill of goods. They are seeing that this plan is simply a Trojan horse full of giveaways to the wealthy, corporations, and Republican political donors.” #GOPTaxScam
@DSenFloor "Republicans are moving ahead with reckless speed to pass this disaster of a bill. So that is why we will be here in a few hours. Yet again voting in the dead of night on a 500 page bill that has had no hearings, no amendments, and has had no real debate." #GOPTaxScam
LIVE NOW: I’m on the @DSenFloor fighting against the disgraceful #GOPTaxScam that will force hardworking, ordinary Americans to pay for tax breaks for billionaires and massive corporations. Watch here: https://t.co/MHqiUjnrze
@MClyburnFCC @SenatorCantwell That’s why I am introducing a Congressional Review Act resolution, with the support of 23 of my @SenateDems colleagues, that will reverse the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality. We aren’t giving up and neither should you.
Thank you to @MClyburnFCC and @SenatorCantwell for hosting their Twitter town hall on #NetNeutrality and to all of those who participated. It is clear the American people believe this is a fight worth having.
The #GOPTaxScam is phase one of a larger con game the @GOP is running. Next up: the evisceration of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. When they come for your benefits – and they will – I pledge to fight to protect them.

@MClyburnFCC @SenatorCantwell How will the repeal of #NetNeutrality impact entrepreneurs and online start-ups that have relied on a free and open internet to get their businesses off the ground?
