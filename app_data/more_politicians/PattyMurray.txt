It was an honor to attend the funeral for President George H.W. Bush today. I send my thoughts and condolences to the Bush family and urge all of us to aspire to the dignity, civility, and service that President Bush modeled throughout his long, remarkable life.
From his courageous sacrifice as a Navy pilot during WWII, to his advocacy for people with disabilities, to his dedication to giving back, President Bush lived his life as a testament to the enduring values of public service and putting your country before yourself.

In just this past year e-cigarette use rose:  
 
- 48% among middle school students 
 
- 78% among high school students
 
We must be vigilant and work to reverse this alarming trend. 
 
https://t.co/dgwg4WKVwf
As of 2018, 1 in 5 high school students use e-cigarettes. Youth tobacco use is an epidemic that needs to be addressed with urgent action. I‚Äôm glad @US_FDA announced new steps, and I'm going to keep pushing to make sure we do more.

I am going to stand with women and survivors across the country and I call on every woman, man, mom, dad, and anyone else who cares about campus safety and preventing sexual assault to make your voices heard.
The Trump Administration is trying to take another step toward sweeping the scourge of sexual assault under the rug, weakening protections for students and survivors, and allowing colleges and universities to shirk their responsibility to keep students safe.
For those of us who have seen President Trump and this Administration attack and undermine women, their health care, their rights, and their well-being over and over‚Äî@BetsyDeVosED's new Title IX rule is deeply disappointing, but far from surprising.

We need to tackle drug prices, but after all the lies from President Trump about protecting people with pre-existing conditions while undermining their care, no one takes him at his word. We heard big talk on drug prices a few months ago too‚Äîwe'll believe it when we see results.
This legislation also provides meaningful support and flexibility to states to help tribal communities address the most pressing problems associated with substance user disorders, and much more.
Our bipartisan bill takes steps to address the root causes &amp; ripple effects of the opioid crisis by providing training to help out-of-work individuals, expanding access to addiction treatment services, &amp; increasing support for pregnant women and infants impacted by opioid misuse.
This week, @SenWarren and I released a report holding the Trump Administration accountable for making empty promises and focusing more on headlines than solutions when it comes to helping our communities face the opioid crisis.

President Trump tried to repeal families‚Äô health care. He expanded junk insurance plans that are not required to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Now, he is backing a lawsuit to strike down those protections. 

#ProtectOurCare #NoJunkPlans

https://t.co/Ej03mrRfcH
If President Trump and the GOP get their way, pre-existing condition protections will be gone, and millions of people will be left paying more for insurance or even losing their coverage. We must protect health care for families and patients. 

https://t.co/Ej03mrRfcH
President Trump is lying about his support for protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

President Trump claims to care about protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but is backing a lawsuit to strike them down. His empty words &amp; gestures will not fool the families &amp; patients that continue to reject the GOP's backward agenda.

Remind Republicans: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are not piggy banks for the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.

2018: GOP sees credit card bill, acts shocked, &amp; now says we must cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid for workers and families (the non-richest).
This ruling is a victory for the more than 100,000 students who were defrauded and stuck with useless credits and massive debt while waiting for relief.

What we saw of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs temperament and the lack of credibility &amp; honesty he demonstrated in his hearings is absolutely disqualifying‚Äîand I‚Äôm not the only one who believes this.
I believe Dr. Ford.

I believe her when she shared her experience.

I don't want my grandchildren to hear that message. I want my country to be better than that.
I listened to Dr. Ford. We all did. I heard her voice &amp; it rang so true to me.

I ran for the Senate after what happened to Anita Hill in 1991‚Äîand I'm confident that if women and their voices are disrespected once again, we‚Äôre going to see a wave of anger, frustration, and activism that makes 1992 look like a ripple. 
 
We still have time to do this right.
If this does end up being jammed through, it would eliminate any trust people have in Senate GOP leaders‚Äîit would cause tremendous anger &amp; backlash across the country from those who are shocked to see the voices of women &amp; survivors ignored like this.
This isn't a partisan issue‚Äîit's common sense. 
 
Like so many people watching last week‚Äôs hearing, I was shocked by Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs rage, anger, &amp; condescension. And I know President Trump loved Judge Kavanaugh's performance &amp; it inspired him to openly mock &amp; attack Dr. Ford.
Based on everything I know about the allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh‚Äîhe should not be confirmed &amp; be in a position to make decisions on the Supreme Court that impact women &amp; families.
 
He testified under oath‚Äîand made claims that simply defy belief &amp; were contradicted.
We've heard from other women‚ÄîMs. Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick‚Äîwith their own experiences. They should be listened to, they should be heard, we should presume they are telling the truth.

I urge my colleagues to vote NO and STOP this mad dash to a rushed confirmation. 
 
I believe Dr. Ford. She has no reason to lie. She was brave &amp; real. Her memories &amp; fear are heartbreaking. Millions of people watched her‚Äîand many women &amp; survivors were inspired by her bravery.
I can say that absolutely nothing I saw in the FBI report makes me believe Dr. Ford any less‚ÄîI'm even more concerned about what we weren‚Äôt able to see because the investigation was limited. 
 
Once again, the voices of women &amp; their experiences have been silenced &amp; pushed aside.
This was rigged from the start to protect Judge Kavanaugh.
 
Dr. Ford wasn‚Äôt interviewed despite her repeated requests. 
We know Judge Kavanaugh wasn‚Äôt questioned again. 
We‚Äôve heard from so many other witnesses who were desperate to talk to the FBI were never even contacted.
This morning, I went in for a briefing on the new FBI investigation and it was very clear that Senate Republican leaders &amp; President Trump cut the FBI off and refused to allow them to conduct the comprehensive and thorough investigation promised to Democrats and Republicans.

It‚Äôs reported that the WH is doing everything they can to limit the FBI investigation that they assured us would be thorough. 

Will the Senate do its job‚Äîor will we allow politics to take over &amp; rush this through before our job is complete?
Last night, President Trump stood on a stage and openly mocked Dr. Ford for not remembering some details of what she has described as the most traumatic event of her life.

4) This is clearly a partisan attempt by some Republicans to discredit Dr. Ford. No fair and independent investigation would come to a conclusion before hearing from witnesses and gathering more info. ‚ÄìPM
3) This is not a trial. Dr. Ford is not on trial. And Judge Kavanaugh is not on trial. The Senate‚Äôs role is to use our judgement ‚Äì not that of a prosecutor ‚Äì to make a decision about his fitness to be on the Supreme Court.
2) Senate Republicans chose to make this a he-said-she-said hearing, it didn‚Äôt have to and shouldn‚Äôt have been. We should have heard from ALL relevant witnesses after full investigation to bring in all facts and info.
1) I watched Dr. Ford share her story &amp; I believe her. She was honest, real, &amp; when she said she was 100% sure, she had absolutely no reason to lie. I watched Judge Kavanaugh &amp; I don‚Äôt believe him. He seemed angry, defensive, entitled &amp; untruthful about a range of subjects.
I have four points I want to make about the partisan memo released by Senate Republicans from the prosecutor they brought in to cross examine the sexual assault survivor they were too scared to question themselves.

Dr. Ford was so brave this morning and I was so proud of the message of hope and inspiration that she sent to all sexual assault survivors. We are here for you, we will support you, we will listen to you, and we will believe you. ‚ÄìPM #BelieveSurvivors
When I watched the Anita Hill hearings in '91, I didn‚Äôt see anyone asking the questions I would ask. This morning I saw a Dem side that looked and sounded like our country asking Dr. Ford respectful questions, and GOP men hiding behind a hired prosecutor cross-examining her ‚ÄìPM
Dr. Ford is so incredibly courageous. I am watching her at this hearing with tears in my eyes. ‚ÄìPM
This hearing is an important step, but it can't be the last one. Two other women want to come testify to share their experiences, and there must be investigation and additional hearings. -PM #BelieveSurvivors
I am joining millions of women watching this hearing right now and paying very close attention to this question: will the Senate listen to women, or will it once again attack and ignore us? -PM
.@BetsyDeVosED's proposal to rescind the rule that allows students defrauded by for-profit colleges to have their student loans forgiven is further proof that Secretary DeVos would rather pad the pockets of for-profit colleges instead of help students.

Women are paying attention‚ÄîRepublicans need to get this right. Because right now, I have some serious concerns.
President Trump &amp; some Senate GOP want to jam Judge Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court no matter what he's done &amp; w/out all the facts.

This isn‚Äôt a box to check.
Women &amp; their experiences aren't things to be ‚Äúplowed through.‚Äù
Women‚Äîand all survivors‚Äîshould be heard &amp; respected.
Republicans are already talking about rushing to a vote‚Äîbefore we even got to this hearing, before there is an investigation, and while women are sharing more stories.

It‚Äôs disgusting, it‚Äôs disgraceful‚Äîand women across the country are paying attention.  #BelieveSurvivors
Senate Republicans are facing a key test right now: are they going to listen to women? Are they going to actually listen‚Äîhear what they say‚Äîtreat them with respect‚Äîand truly investigate their claims?

It only takes one story of a teacher accidentally firing a gun in a classroom, leaving a gun in a school bathroom, or threatening a child with a gun, to know we need fewer firearms in schools‚Äînot more.

I call on @BetsyDeVosED to end this dangerous proposal immediately.
In the aftermath of many school shootings, we should be doing everything we can to address gun violence and make our schools safer. Unfortunately, Secretary @BetsyDeVosED is heading in the opposite direction by allowing schools to use federal funds to purchase guns for teachers.

When working on the Opioid Crisis Response Act, we heard about the many different faces of this epidemic and its root causes and ripple effects. I‚Äôm going to keep fighting for more solutions for families in Washington state and across the country.

Scheduling a hearing for Monday, a week after Dr. Ford made her accusations public, is a shameful attempt to jam this through without giving anyone the time they need to investigate and put together the questions that need to be asked.

The Opioid Crisis Response Act is a result of the Senate working together to create legislation that looks for common ground and common sense solutions for families on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic.

People in Washington are seeing the impacts of President Trump‚Äôs trade war. That's why I will continue working to put an end to these tariffs and continue to call for trade deals that work for everyone‚Äîour growers, exporters, &amp; workers.

We should be doing more, not less, to keep dangerous greenhouse gases out of our atmosphere &amp; reverse the impact of climate change on our environment‚Äîif for no other reason than we should care more about people &amp; public health than increasing profits for Big Oil &amp; Gas.

This week‚Äôs Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh should be delayed. This is not a difficult decision. The fact is that Senators have new information about a potential crime committed by a Supreme Court nominee and an accuser who has come forward.

I'm glad that Chairman Grassley has started to listen to members telling him he can‚Äôt simply sweep  allegations against Judge Kavanaugh under the rug.
 
It‚Äôs not just going to go away, and I am glad Republican leaders are starting to realize that.
We must listen to Professor Ford. We must treat this survivor with empathy. We must evaluate this new information. Anything less for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court would be an abdication of the Senate‚Äôs constitutional role and it would be absolutely wrong.
We cannot allow Republicans to attack Dr. Ford in a misguided attempt to protect Judge Kavanaugh and put politics ahead of their jobs as United States Senators, and I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to put a stop to it wherever they see it.
Women who come forward should be listened to, heard, and believed‚Äîand investigations and all appropriate actions should be taken once they have come forward to share their experiences.
An all-male Judiciary committee dropped the ball in 1991, and we cannot allow an all-male Republican side of the Judiciary Committee do the same in 2018. https://t.co/3A9RqIRnH6
Happy Birthday @usairforce! Thank you for your hard work and service in keeping our country safe. I am grateful for your continual sacrifice to protect the American people.
Transparency can do a lot to help patients and families, but it‚Äôs not enough on its own to fix President Trump‚Äôs health care sabotage. We need common sense solutions that actually make a difference, drive down costs, and roll back the damage President Trump has done.
We know transparency can help make improvements in health care, but unfortunately instead of increasing transparency President Trump‚Äôs sabotage has only increased chaos and made it harder for families to get the care they need. https://t.co/lk4Z5oKuVH
I was motivated to run for the Senate after watching the truly awful way Anita Hill was treated by an all-male Judiciary Committee interrogating her about the now-Justice Clarence Thomas.

There is no urgency to fill this seat before October. Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open for more than a year all to prevent President Obama from fulfilling his constitutional role. Surely we can take the time we need now in order to fulfill OUR constitutional role.
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination needs to be delayed‚Äîwe absolutely cannot go forward with a vote this Thursday. The idea that this nomination would be jammed through given what we know now is almost unthinkable and would be shameful and wrong.

While the Opioid Crisis Response Act is an important bipartisan step in addressing this national tragedy this is an ongoing crisis, meaning our efforts to fight it must be ongoing too.

It would be inconceivable &amp; abhorrent to hold a vote on this nominee in the coming days‚Äîwe need time to evaluate this new information and give it the scrutiny it deserves. Anything less would be an absolute abdication of the Senate‚Äôs constitutional advice &amp; consent role.
The fact is that Senators now have new information about a potential crime committed by a nominee for the highest court in the land and an accuser who has come forward with details of the alleged criminal act.
This week‚Äôs Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh should be delayed. It‚Äôs not a debatable or difficult decision.
I want to thank Prof. Ford for her bravery. I can only imagine the trauma &amp; heartache involved in sharing &amp; reliving a sexual assault like this‚Äîshe should know that I and millions of people are standing by her side and stand ready to help however we can. https://t.co/ubOYcKrV2p
Under Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs vision for our country, a woman‚Äôs ability to get reproductive health care would overwhelmingly depend, like it did before Roe, on whether she could afford it, and therefore, disproportionately on her race and zip code as well.

We know Judge #Kavanaugh won‚Äôt be a Justice who will vote to uphold women‚Äôs Constitutionally protected rights and her freedoms. That and so much more is #WhatsAtStake with this nomination.
President Trump made it absolutely clear that he would nominate Supreme Court justices who would strike down health care for families across the nation‚Äîthen he nominated Judge Kavanaugh.
I urge anyone‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwoman or man‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho is concerned right now to make that clear‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääloudly and immediately. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/8Qo7vG3b5U
Reminder: The Senate still has yet to see most of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs record, &amp; just last night Republicans released 42,000 pages of WH documents. The American people deserve more time to review Kavanaugh's record &amp; decisions he made regarding women‚Äôs health, health care, &amp; more.
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation hearing starts today, and women‚Äôs constitutionally protected freedoms hang in the balance. https://t.co/XOU6kb9xPu
Today, Republicans are starting confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh. If you believe in women‚Äôs constitutionally protected health care freedoms, protections for workers, our environment, voting rights, and so much more, make your voice heard NOW.
This is outrageous. 42,000 documents released just hours before his confirmation hearing begins.

It would be a disgraceful for Republicans to schedule hearings on President Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee as they continue to block the release of Judge Kavanuagh‚Äôs full record‚Äîespecially as the cloud of corruption surrounding President Trump grows by the day.
There is no reason for Republicans to rush this Supreme Court nominee through given that President Trump appears to be an unindicted co-conspirator of a federal crime and the Supreme Court may soon have to take up a case related to his potential crimes and corruption.
Trump Administration officials are hoping we forgot there are still 500+ kids in our government‚Äôs care who were needlessly separated from their parents due to President Trump‚Äôs cruel ‚Äòzero-tolerance‚Äô family separation policy.

Republicans are blocking the release of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs complete record &amp; President Trump appears to be an unindicted co-conspirator to a federal crime. Put together, that‚Äôs more than enough reason to wait before we hold hearings to fill the open seat on the Supreme Court.

As one of our country‚Äôs most trade-dependent states, there‚Äôs a ton at stake for WA growers, exporters, &amp; families if President Trump‚Äôs reckless tariffs continue. 
 
Even more worrisome, WA families will most likely end up paying the highest price for this backward trade agenda.
What‚Äôs the Trump Administration‚Äôs answer for wage stagnation &amp; growing economic inequality in communities in WA &amp; nationwide? 
 
Apparently, more tax cuts for the wealthiest families &amp; corporations that need it least. https://t.co/vaqEMk4lyg
As we celebrate the anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, we cannot forget that these immensely successful programs are under siege. President Trump and Republicans have sought to sabotage Medicaid, slash Medicare, and reduce access to life-saving care.
 
Not on our watch.
53 years ago this week, President Johnson signed #Medicare and #Medicaid into law, helping millions to afford the care they need, no matter their age or income. We have an obligation to uphold that promise and protect these programs, which insure over 100 million people.
Civil rights, including the rights of people with disabilities, are on the line with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh. We have to keep making our voices heard and do everything we can to oppose this nomination. https://t.co/vRqphbudpM

A decision to shut down the government over President Trump‚Äôs costly border wall would be a choice made by Republicans‚Äîthe Party that controls the Senate, House, &amp; White House.
President Trump wants to expand junk plans that spend half their revenue on administrative waste. He wants to make it easier for insurers to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, and then reward themselves for it with executive bonuses.
We have plenty of opportunities to help bring down health care costs by reducing complexity and administrative costs, but this cannot come at the expense of patients, their safety, or their health.

The overwhelming majority of Americans have made it clear they want more common sense gun safety reforms to keep their families safe, not fewer‚Äî&amp; the Trump Administration‚Äôs decision to allow 3-D printing for guns is a direct rebuke to their wishes, &amp; the health &amp; safety of ppl.

A President who, far beyond any modern President, has championed the anti-choice cause, has found exactly what he is looking for in Judge Kavanaugh: a fifth vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Judge Kavanaugh would be a reliable vote on the Supreme Court to roll back the progress we‚Äôve made to protect our vital air, water, natural resources, &amp; so much more.

Despite what the White House would have us believe, this is not a country that wants to follow President Trump, Vice President Pence, and five male Supreme Court justices back to 1972. But the only way to stop this from happening is for people to take action.
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs record proves he would not be the fair voice working families need. Throughout his long career, Kavanaugh has repeatedly sided with corporate special interests at the expense of workers, their rights, and their families. #StopKavanaugh
Through a series of executive orders, President Trump has taken steps to make it harder for federal workers to organize, bargain collectively for better wages and conditions, and resolve disputes equitably‚Äîsending a clear signal this Administration won‚Äôt stand up for workers.
The federal government has a responsibility to ensure every worker is treated fairly and with dignity. The government has an even more direct responsibility to look after its own workers, and should be a model for protecting the rights of workers.
Federal workers ensure our grandparents receive Social Security. They investigate claims of wage theft. They‚Äôre the nurses and doctors who take care of veterans. They‚Äôre the first responders when natural disasters strike. They protect our water and air.
 
I stand with them.

If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, a woman's ability to get reproductive health care could overwhelmingly depend, like it did before Roe, on whether she could afford it, and therefore, disproportionately on her race and zip code as well. https://t.co/59bBhL4QQ2
When I examine the record and history of a Supreme Court nominee, I hope to see a breadth of life experience, or the ability to walk in someone else‚Äôs shoes. Judge Kavanaugh has not demonstrated either of these qualities.
Anyone who says President Trump isn‚Äôt applying an anti-choice litmus test in this nomination‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor thinks it‚Äôs unclear where President Trump‚Äôs allegiance lies when it comes to women‚Äôs health‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshould take a look at what he‚Äôs said and done.
While President Trump has broken promise after promise to workers &amp; families, he has never once wavered in following through for those anti-choice special interests. He has done virtually everything he can to chip away at women's reproductive rights from the Oval Office.
I‚Äôll keep saying it: the threat to women‚Äôs reproductive rights is frighteningly real. It is real because unless Democrats and Republicans come together, President Trump will follow through on his promise to overturn Roe.
Should Judge Kavanaugh be confirmed, he would be a fifth vote on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and roll back reproductive rights women have had for more than four decades. https://t.co/o4U5ZPHoeR

Families across the country rely on the Affordable Care Act to stay healthy, and when their coverage was threatened, people spoke up, rallied, and let their Senators know just how damaging Trumpcare would have been.

It worked, and Trumpcare failed.

This is not a partisan issue‚Äîthis about defending the integrity &amp; foundational values of our nation. This is about Congress doing its job &amp; holding the President accountable for his shocking &amp; repeated failures. And this is about putting the country before party.
With the power to call up legislation &amp; hold hearings, Republican leaders have options, and they certainly have a whole lot of Democrats who stand ready &amp; willing to help. So my message to every member of the Senate, and to every member of the House, is clear:
It‚Äôs time to: 
-strengthen Russian sanctions 
-demand answers from WH about the Trump-Putin closed-door meeting &amp; provide any notes that exist
-protect DOJ, the FBI &amp; the special counsel 
-extradite the 12 Russians indicted for election attacks
-pass election security legislation
Many Republicans in Congress are acting as if they aren‚Äôt the party in control of the Senate and the House &amp; they don‚Äôt have the ability to actually make a difference &amp; demand change. This is absurd‚Äîand the time for handwringing &amp; hoping the problem just goes away is over.
Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed outrage at President Trump‚Äôs disgraceful remarks, and I‚Äôm glad to see them speaking up, because words matter. But you know what also matters? Action. 
 
Now, we must all ask: what will Congressional Republicans do about this?
The world watched yesterday as President Trump showered praise upon the Russian President who directed the interference of our elections. It was deeply horrifying &amp; alarming that our President failed to use that moment to push Putin to end his attacks on our country &amp; elections.
Instead of standing up for our national values &amp; security, our President defended Putin on all fronts. Now it seems Trump is desperately trying to backtrack‚Äîbut we all heard what he said &amp; know where he stands. It‚Äôs appalling, inexcusable, &amp; unworthy of the Presidency.

It was truly horrifying and deeply alarming to see the President of the United States stand with the President of Russia in undercutting the work of our intelligence agencies and blaming America for the attacks on our elections and our democracy.
Time &amp; again, we‚Äôve seen President Trump respond to pressure from people across the country who have raised their voices to hold him &amp; his administration accountable.
Families across the globe are risking everything to flee violence &amp; persecution in their countries &amp; start a new life here in the US--only to be thrown in jail &amp; needlessly separated from their children for weeks, even months. 

This is not who we are, &amp; we can‚Äôt let this stand.

The US intelligence community concluded more than a year ago that Russia did in fact meddle in our elections. What‚Äôs more, there is every reason to believe Russia will do it again in the next election.
In Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump has found exactly what he was looking for‚Äîsomeone who will put extreme, right-wing ideology ahead of patients‚Äô access to health care.
Too many hospitals don‚Äôt have the resources or trained staff to help sexual assault survivors hold their perpetrators accountable. Passing #SASCA to help provide survivors the support they need is a critical step in the right direction. https://t.co/ivPgrMd8Jc

Hearing Leah‚Äôs story &amp; knowing that too many survivors across the US have shared her painful experience of being denied critical care is why I‚Äôm proud to work w/ @leahegriffin, @lisamurkowski, @RepJayapal &amp; so many others to pass #SASCA. https://t.co/DJVSmInYmu
Judge Kavanaugh is the ideological dream pick for President Trump, Vice President Pence, and the conservative special interests whose lists they‚Äôre choosing from, and we have to keep making our voices heard against his nomination.
There is simply too much at stake to sit on the sidelines. We can defeat this Supreme Court nomination, but only if we do it the way we defeated Trumpcare‚Äîwhen people across the country stood up and said ‚Äúnot on our watch."
The majority of Americans do not want our daughters and granddaughters to lose constitutional protections women have had for more than four decades. This is what‚Äôs at stake with President Trump‚Äôs extreme Supreme Court nominee.
Roe v. Wade affirmed that women in the United States have the constitutional right to make their own reproductive health care decisions‚Äîand we‚Äôre committed to doing everything we can to ensure that right is protected. https://t.co/IQZRtDIrzH

The public was rightly concerned to learn President Trump‚Äôs close associates are selling access to the Administration and getting million dollar contracts from drug companies. https://t.co/77WRHOgl5e
Make no mistake: if Judge Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court bench, five men will be empowered to overturn Roe v. Wade and take us back to the days when women didn‚Äôt have the option of accessing safe, legal abortion.
With President Trump‚Äôs nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, we have never been more at risk of going backward. And I‚Äôm going to keep standing with women across the country against each and every attempt by President Trump to restrict women‚Äôs access to care.
President Trump has broken promise after promise, but he has never once wavered in listening to extreme, ideological special interests when it comes to women‚Äôs access to health care. #WhatsAtStake
This bill, which I introduced in the Senate, would build on the work that she so tirelessly championed on Capitol Hill: reducing disparities in breast and gynecological cancer detection.

Even after a court ruling, too many migrant kids who were needlessly separated from their families are still waiting for the Trump Administration to reunite them w their parents.

We will not stop watching.

We will not stop holding you accountable.

We will not forget.
Yesterday, the Trump Administration missed a critical deadline to reunite dozens of young kids w their parents after they were needlessly separated. 

Today, we must raise our voices &amp; make them even louder to ensure President Trump brings these families back together.
After weeks &amp; months of separation, some of the youngest kids being reunited w their families don‚Äôt even recognize their parents.

Make your voice heard that people in WA &amp; across the country won‚Äôt let this unthinkable action stand. https://t.co/kksJDd1rhV?

I voted against Judge Kavanaugh when he was nominated for the circuit court and I strongly oppose this nomination now.
 
I‚Äôm also calling on all of my colleagues to stand with me in rejecting him.
President Trump has nominated another anti-worker, anti-union nominee to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has a long history of ruling in the favor of corporations &amp; big business‚Äîat the expense of workers. I‚Äôm going to keep fighting against attempts to undermine working families.
As dark money groups have spent billions on campaigns designed to chip away at workers‚Äô rights, union membership and workers‚Äô bargaining power have both declined. As a result, wages for working families have stagnated, while billionaires like the Koch brothers have gotten richer.
Unions helped create the 40-hour workweek, end child labor, and strengthen the middle class. When unions have the power to bargain on behalf of employees, we‚Äôre all better off. But the Supreme Court‚Äôs recent #Janus decision undermines their ability to do exactly that.
I‚Äôm about to speak on the vital role that unions play in raising wages and creating pathways to the middle class at our hearing with labor leaders, teachers, and home care workers. Watch live: https://t.co/PBPSUGZIk6
A vote for President Trump‚Äôs Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to step back from the progress we‚Äôve made to expand rights, freedoms, and basic human decency to LGBTQ Americans.
Mr. Benczkowski is not the nominee our country needs, especially when so many questions remain about Trump's ties to Russia. We need someone free of conflicts and someone with real experience. I will be voting NO.
It is outrageous that President Trump‚Äôs pick to lead DOJ criminal division not only has 0 prosecutorial experience, but has direct ties to Russia‚Äôs Alfa Bank. Benczkowski is not up to the job when it comes to getting all the answers in the Russia Investigation.
A vote for President Trump‚Äôs Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to give massive corporations even more power over our economy, our workers, and our elections.
A vote for President Trump‚Äôs Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to end protections for patients with pre-existing conditions and go back to the bad-old days when insurance companies were in charge &amp; people would have to pay more, or be cut off from care, simply for being sick.

More than any President I‚Äôve seen, President Trump has been explicit about what he expects from a nominee. He has laid out specific tests &amp; promised to only pick nominees from a pre-screened list of people who would absolutely meet them.
The balance of the court is on the line &amp; we know exactly where this nominee will fall on the specific issues.
 
We know because President Trump told us: openly, publicly, and repeatedly.
I‚Äôm heading to the floor to talk about my strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh for a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court. -PM
I‚Äôm urging everyone‚Äîin red states and blue states, big cities and small towns‚Äîto make their voice heard right now: call your Senator, show up at rallies, organize online and in person. There is so much at stake.
This is not a time for anyone to sit back &amp; watch while the Supreme Court and the future of our nation hangs in the balance. We just need a few Republicans to stand up to President Trump and stand with Democrats and people across the country in rejecting this nominee.
President Trump must nominate someone who is clearly &amp; strongly committed to not rolling back settled law when it comes to women‚Äôs health &amp; patient protections‚Äî&amp; to protecting the rights &amp; freedoms that people across the country hold so dear. Judge Kavanaugh fails on both counts.
I‚Äôm also calling on all my Senate colleagues to stand with me and with people across the country in rejecting Kavanaugh. https://t.co/W250csawLX
President Trump, more than any President I‚Äôve seen, has been explicit about what he expects from a nominee‚Äîand based on everything I know about Judge Kavanaugh, he is exactly what President Trump is looking for. So, I oppose this nomination.

In a moment as pivotal as this, it can feel like there‚Äôs no way to make a difference. But nothing is further from the truth. In fact, it is essential that President Trump and Republicans hear from people like you nationwide who do not want to go backward.
You all know as well as I do that in particular, a Trump #scotus nominee could gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and take away constitutional protections for women‚Äôs reproductive rights under Roe v. Wade. We have to make our voices heard for #WhatsAtStake

Let‚Äôs be clear: when the Trump-Pence Administration tells you not to worry about your constitutionally protected health care rights, you should get worried. If you care about a woman‚Äôs right to control her own body in our country, now is the time to make your voice heard.
Simply living or traveling near the border is not a sufficient reason to hassle or detain people in WA‚Äîproud to introduce legislation to limit warrantless searches near our national borders. https://t.co/dSiovDnkt9

Justice Kennedy‚Äôs retirement comes at a time when so many of our values are under attack‚Äîwe must keep making our voices heard to say we care about how people are treated in this country, we care about a woman‚Äôs freedom to make her own decisions.

I want to be clear: Republican leaders should give families across the country the opportunity to weigh in, with an election, before moving forward to fill this seat.
A right means nothing with the ability to exercise it, which is why we can‚Äôt remain silent as radical Republicans create new barriers to prevent women from making their own health care decisions. I won‚Äôt stop fighting, and I know women across the country won‚Äôt either.
Two years ago, the Supreme Court once again affirmed the constitutional right of women to make decisions about their own body and future‚Äîincluding the right to safe, legal abortion. And I will not stop fighting to protect the progress we‚Äôve made.
There are plenty of commonsense things we can do to bring down health care costs, for example Washington state‚Äôs Medicaid Transformation is leading the way in developing innovative programs to provide higher quality care at lower cost.
Let me be clear: women and men in this country understand how directly tied a woman‚Äôs freedom to make her own decision about her own body is to her economic security. And they overwhelmingly do not want to see that right rolled back. https://t.co/b5rGM7IIZ1
One issue that I know women across the country will be focused on and asking about is their constitutionally protected right to control their own health care decisions, affirmed in Roe v. Wade.
Voting rights are at stake. LGBTQ progress is at stake. The right to organize collectively is at stake. And those are just a few. There is so much more.
People are going to want to know: will their rights be protected? Will their freedoms be secure? Will SCOTUS put people like them first or stand with special interests, big biz, and the most extreme ideologues in our country?
I share the deep concern of so many families across this country who are already suffering under the Trump Administration and fear further erosion of the progress in this country.
It is clear that Justice Kennedy‚Äôs retirement comes at a pivotal point in our nation‚Äôs history, when so many of our values are under attack by a president who has spent every day in office testing the limits of our Constitution.

For more than a century, unions have organized to lift up the voices of workers who were otherwise unheard, and fought for fair pay, safer working conditions, and better benefits.

While it‚Äôs a good thing President Trump dialed back his systematic child abuse‚Äîit‚Äôs not enough.
 
We are not going to say everything is OK, and we are not going to stay quiet.
President Trump says his executive order stops the separation, but does that mean starting today? Next month? When? What about the thousands of children who were removed? Will they ever see their parents again, and if so, when? Where?
Today we saw President Trump change his story about whether he did in fact have the ability to make it stop, but so many questions remain: How parents are being informed about their children‚Äôs safety, where they are located, when they will be reunited?
People nationwide have have been watching the pain this forced family separation has caused so many innocent children and have begged President Trump to pick up the phone, sign a piece of paper‚Äîdo whatever it takes to make it stop.

Women &amp; families fleeing domestic &amp; sexual abuse, kids being forced by violence to join gangs‚Äîthese are some of the people seeking safety &amp; asylum at our borders. 

Turning them away is not only cruel, but undermines our shared values &amp; the promise of the American dream.

President Trump could choose to have empathy &amp; show compassion to families fleeing traumatic crime &amp; violence. He could choose to keep families together instead of ripping them apart. 

The reality is he simply chooses not to.
No matter your party, it should go w/o saying that detaining innocent kids &amp; separating them from their families is beyond cruel. 

Now more than ever, we must make our voices heard to end this despicable treatment of families seeking to come to our country.

@realDonaldTrump While we can and should recognize there is a problem with the overcapacity and oversupply of steel and aluminum, President Trump‚Äôs reckless, scattershot approach is threatening relationships with our allies, including our neighbor Canada, and jeopardizing American exports.
@realDonaldTrump WA is the most trade dependent state in the nation, and President Trump‚Äôs tariffs pose a unique and potentially devastating threat to our growers and economy, as well as the millions of families who could see the costs of everyday goods go up.
As @realDonaldTrump escalates his trade war today, I'm urging him: take steps to strengthen the relationships we have with our allies in order to go after bad actors and address unfair trade.

Democrats are still at the table. We‚Äôll be here all August ready to fix this for families in Washington state and across the country. I hope Republicans will return to the table and join us on finding solutions to lower patients‚Äô costs and strengthen health care in our country.
While President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have never fought for patients‚Äîas their latest decision makes abundantly clear‚ÄîDemocrats have never stopped fighting for them. And we‚Äôre not going to stop now.
Trumpcare failed because people across the country made it clear they didn‚Äôt support President Trump‚Äôs sabotage agenda. President Trump didn‚Äôt listen. Instead he‚Äôs continued to undermine health care for our families at every opportunity, and Congressional Republicans have helped.
This decision is unacceptable‚Äîit will abandon laws that prevent insurers from denying people with pre-existing conditions coverage, charging people more because of their gender, and raising premiums without limit for seniors and effectively pricing them out of the market.
Last week, the Trump Administration showed once again there‚Äôs no limit to how low and how baseless they‚Äôll go to appeal to extreme Republican donors and special interests. DOJ announced that it will ignore years of precedent and abandon its duty to defend our laws in court.
Good reminder of the frightening risks of President Trump‚Äôs anti-middle class agenda: ‚Äú‚Ä¶add all of this to sharp tax cuts &amp; spending increases‚Ä¶plus President Trump‚Äôs ill-conceived tariffs upon imports, &amp; conditions are ripe for another financial crisis‚Äù https://t.co/4Z1jNbKGxK

President Trump listing proposals from his partisan budget as accomplishments to reduce drug costs is like saying dinner is served dinner when you‚Äôve only written a grocery list. And in this case, most of the ingredients are for a big nothing-burger.
In fact, despite his claim that he was ‚Äòvery much eliminating the middlemen,‚Äô his plan includes proposals which would have the opposite effect‚Äîempowering the companies he calls middlemen, without any data to suggest it will bring down prices for patients.
While campaigning, President Trump constantly brought up the idea of negotiating lower prices through Medicare‚Äîbut it‚Äôs nowhere to be found in his proposal. As with so many other issues, President Trump talked a big game, and then, instead of backing it up, he backed away.
President Trump hyped his drug pricing plan as a big step forward‚Äîit‚Äôs very clearly not. In fact, when he announced his plan to bring drug companies‚Äô prices down, their stocks actually went up.
Too many families are struggling to make ends meet because of skyrocketing drug prices. 1 in 4 people report that someone in their family didn‚Äôt get a prescription filled because cost. 1 in 4 cancer patients avoided filling a prescription for the same reason.
As a candidate, President Trump talked a big game on lowering drug prices, but after 500 days in office the only health care ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù he has dropped is his former Secretary.

We‚Äôve now shown that we can work together to make progress on this issue, and there is every reason to keep pushing for more‚Äîhere in Congress and in workplaces across the country. That‚Äôs exactly what we plan to do. https://t.co/laoiudFwiF
This step forward was only possible because women chose to come forward with painful stories of assault and harassment in order to prevent other women from experiencing the same. I am inspired by their courage. https://t.co/x4ABWBKQnH
Thankful for the great work done by @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenGillibrand, @RoyBlunt &amp; others to negotiate this bipartisan bill, which will help increase transparency, extend protections, &amp; give survivors of workplace harassment in Congress more tools to hold perpetrators accountable.
This is a long-overdue and much-needed step toward overhauling the way harassment is addressed in the United States Congress. It‚Äôs an important step, but it cannot be the last. https://t.co/nd5jAKD1m2

@PPFA @Guttmacher @SenTinaSmith In my home state of Washington, health care providers funded by #TitleX delivered contraceptive care to more than 80,000 patients in one year alone.

We should all know by now that no family, no school, no community is exempt from the tragedy of gun violence.

We can‚Äôt stand by doing nothing &amp; expect the status quo to change. It‚Äôs beyond time to pass common-sense gun reforms.
Too many women &amp; families in WA &amp; nationwide count on the care they receive at @PPFA to lead healthy, independent lives for us to allow the Trump Administration‚Äôs latest attacks on women‚Äôs health to stand‚Äîwe must stand up &amp; fight back. https://t.co/G0WYg0VXnQ

These ‚Äúhidden heroes‚Äù often make significant personal sacrifices to make sure the men &amp; women who sacrificed for our country are taken care of‚Äî&amp; as a nation, it‚Äôs our job to have their backs. Excited to help push this major win for veterans across the finish line.

This move by the Trump-Pence Admin would put a domestic gag rule in place, forbidding health care providers who receive #TitleX family planning funds from discussing the full range of repro care options w/ patients‚Äîa brazen attempt to interfere w/ women‚Äôs access to health care.
Let me be clear: President Trump and Vice President Pence‚Äôs opinions have no place in a woman‚Äôs conversations with her doctor about her health care‚Äîand I and women nationwide are going to fight this deeply harmful, ideological effort every step of the way. https://t.co/6b4qpIHliw

Our health care workforce training programs have a positive impact‚Äîbut we need to invest in that impact on a larger scale. Compared to the scope of the problem, we are fighting fires with a squirt gun.
We need to make sure we have a strong pipeline to recruit, train, and retain more health professionals, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and we need to make sure that pipeline includes professionals who have different backgrounds and specialties.
Building a robust, diverse, collaborative workforce isn‚Äôt just one big challenge, it is many smaller, interconnected challenges too. https://t.co/SmH7V3AG2e

This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to keep doing everything to pass the Child Care for Working Families Act. #movement4childcare
When it comes to voting to protect #NetNeutrality, the choice couldn‚Äôt be easier. Either stand with everyday people‚Äîor with the massive corporations that have found a new way to make more money off of them.

@SecAzar @HHSGov Any attempt by the Administration to break its promises and undo the bipartisan funding deal the President signed into law would be a major breach of faith, and we will strongly oppose it.
@SecAzar @HHSGov A budget isn‚Äôt just a set of numbers, it‚Äôs a statement of values and priorities‚Äîand President Trump‚Äôs budget proposal for @HHSgov shows this Administration does not value evidence, science, and good policymaking practices.

I oppose this latest reckless move by President Trump to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal, and I strongly encourage him to reconsider. -PM
This decision also erodes our ability to make new diplomatic agreements as we head into critical talks with North Korea, and it increases regional tension and moves us closer to armed conflict that should be avoided if at all possible.
President Trump taking these steps to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal right now, without presenting any good evidence or rationale that Iran has violated it, moves us further from our goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
Once again, we must raise our voices &amp; defend our communities against these efforts to rip the social safety net away from families in need. As a voice for WA, I pledge to continue fighting back against these cruel, reckless proposals.
WA needs more, not less, affordable housing‚Äîbut the Trump Administration‚Äôs plan to slash funding for key housing programs would make it much harder to connect WA families in need w affordable housing options in their communities #CutsHurt

There‚Äôs a lot of work to do to address the pervasive, systemic, &amp; longstanding issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. We should be collecting more data to help us understand the impacts, &amp; I‚Äôm disappointed @BLS_gov won‚Äôt commit to this critical step. https://t.co/0om6tmEMd3
Listening to Seattle parents in recovery recount the impact of their substance use on their children, it‚Äôs clear that we must do more to support patients &amp; families while we work to end the #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/gNbgGLIP7p
I hope we can step back and look at what‚Äôs right for kids in the long term. And I hope @BetsyDeVosED will come to realize that means serious investments in public education and support for our teachers and schools.  https://t.co/WD3BGJLUtq
.@BetsyDeVosED still doesn‚Äôt seem to get it‚Äîthe Secretary of Education should listen to our teachers and parents and stand up for public education. https://t.co/WD3BGJujBS
If @BLS_gov really takes workplace sexual harassment ‚Äúvery seriously‚Äù it should commit to collecting data on this issue‚Äîinstead they told us it would be ‚Äúcomplex and costly.‚Äù Workers and women deserve better. https://t.co/0om6tmWnBD
As so many K-12 teachers are organizing and using their voices to fight for more investments in public education, early childhood educators and child care workers are still being left behind. Here's what we can do about it √† https://t.co/KjNUvQNj4v
It has been clear that Republican sabotage will cause health care premiums to skyrocket, I‚Äôm glad former Secretary Price is finally willing to admit these efforts are going to make care less affordable for families. https://t.co/qC9CRfQnhD
Had a great time today visiting the staff &amp; children at @WWU‚Äôs AS Child Development Center. It‚Äôs up to all of us to ensure our next generation of thinkers, workers &amp; leaders are prepared for the challenges of the future‚Äîand that starts with giving them a solid educational start. https://t.co/pByndotlvj
Now that former Secretary Price has admitted Republican health care sabotage will drive up prices. Republicans should drop the partisanship and work with Democrats to repair as much of the damage they‚Äôve done as possible. https://t.co/qC9CRg7Y9b

A federal judge paused President Trump‚Äôs reckless efforts to end the DACA program last week, but it‚Äôs no substitute for legislative action. It‚Äôs past time for Republican leaders in Congress to work w Democrats to write permanent protections for Dreamers into our laws.

He needs to be held accountable for his failures at @EPA and resign. https://t.co/ZeUlpzLQgN
This should be a lesson to Republican leaders and those trying to cut corners and jam nominees through the Senate‚Äîthere is a reason that we want to take the time to scrutinize nominees and make sure they are ready and able to do the job.
The position of VA Secretary has never been, nor should ever be, an afterthought. I hope President Trump takes the lessons of this failed nominee to heart &amp; recommends someone with the integrity, leadership, management experience, and dedication to serve our veterans.
The lack of scrutiny that President Trump gave his most recent VA Secretary nominee is an insult to the millions of veterans who deserve a serious and strong leader who is ready on day one to bring this agency up to what is expected by all Americans. https://t.co/7vLSqKE149

Throughout his nomination process, Director Pompeo failed to convince me that he is that person. So I will vote no on his nomination to be Secretary of State, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
The Secretary of State position is always a critically important position. But it takes on even more meaning in 2018. The president not only needs good counsel navigating our complex global relationships, he also desperately needs someone who can tell him when he‚Äôs wrong.
Director Pompeo has repeatedly supported the Global Gag Rule which keeps funding from clinics and programs that provide women important medical care and voted to defund the UN Population Fund which provides family planning services for women around the world living in poverty.
I‚Äôm afraid Director Pompeo would undo much of that legacy, and undermine so much of the global progress we have made. https://t.co/8ijPZqPOUt
Our nation has an important role to uphold as a global champion of women‚Äôs rights. We need a Secretary of State who will be a strong advocate &amp; continue our legacy of leadership fighting for women‚Äôs health, reproductive freedom, and the rights of women &amp; girls across the world.
The position of Secretary of State is too important &amp; the stakes are too high to let Director Pompeo  slide by w/o full consideration of what it would mean for him to be our nation‚Äôs top diplomat‚Äîthe person whose every word and action broadcasts America‚Äôs values to the the world.
I‚Äôm heading to the Senate floor to voice my strong opposition to Director Pompeo‚Äôs nomination to be our next Secretary of State. -PM
It's the Dept of Education's responsibility to protect the civil rights of every student. Instead, @BetsyDeVosED has dismissed more than 500 disability rights cases. Enforcing the rights of students with disabilities should be a top priority for Sec DeVos. https://t.co/4HvFK990Gd
When @BetsyDeVosED rolled back systemic investigations at the Office for Civil Rights, her actions had real consequences. Now too many students are paying the price. https://t.co/86pxbT8UUn
Someone has to do the work on behalf of the families we represent‚Äîand if the past year and a half is any indication ‚Äì it‚Äôs certainly not going to be President Trump or his Administration.
I know the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee is ready to dig into Mr. Jackson‚Äôs nomination, and I am hopeful that we can get the facts we need, debate them as appropriate, and do our jobs free from any political attempts to jam this nominee through.
Yet President Trump ‚Äì who paid a whole lot of lip service to veterans during his campaign‚Äîeither didn‚Äôt care, or didn‚Äôt bother to take the time to ensure he was sending over a fully-vetted nominee. It‚Äôs sloppy, it‚Äôs disrespectful to our veterans, and it‚Äôs just wrong.
When this country sends men and women to war, we have an obligation to care for them long after they return. And critical to fulfilling that promise is a strong VA, led by a highly-qualified VA Secretary who is free from ethical conflicts.
When it comes to President Trump‚Äôs nominees, Democrats have made it very clear: we‚Äôre not going to allow nominees to be jammed through without proper scrutiny and debate.

No cutting corners. No playing fast and loose with the facts. No cutting off debate.
This should be pretty basic work in the Senate, but it‚Äôs more important now than ever before. https://t.co/YgsJzfj9tf
One of the most important roles we have in the Senate is to advise &amp; consent on Presidential nominees‚Äîto scrutinize &amp; make sure they are qualified, ensure they'll put people ahead of special interests, &amp; that they don‚Äôt have ethical challenges, financial issues, or other concerns
Any one of the cases Mr. Duncan has taken, or the ideological arguments he has made should raise alarm‚Äî all of them together paint an unmistakable picture of a nominee who would not uphold women‚Äôs rights, LGBTQ rights, or civil rights.
In my home state of Washington, Mr. Duncan filed a brief arguing pharmacies should be allowed to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions for ideological reasons. Fortunately, his views did not prevail.
Mr. Duncan was on the wrong side of these rights in the infamous Hobby Lobby case, fighting for intolerant bathroom bans against transgender people, and defending the discriminatory Voter ID law in North Carolina which SCOTUS struck down.
Heading to the floor to oppose Kyle Duncan to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ‚Äì he‚Äôs an ideological nominee with an awful track record working against women‚Äôs rights, LGBTQ rights, and civil rights. -PM
All across the country, students of color are being punished more often and more severely than their white peers. So it's extremely troubling that @BetsyDeVosED closed a number of investigations into schools that unfairly punish students. https://t.co/86pxbT8UUn
The opioid crisis costs Washington state over $9 billion dollars a year‚Äîto say nothing of the personal loss so many families suffer. We need to get this done.
We listened and learned from those on the frontlines of the opioid crisis, then we looked for solutions‚Äîand we found over 40 great ideas we were able to include in this important bill.
Speaking soon at HELP Committee hearing as we prepare to move forward our bipartisan opioid response bill to support our families and communities. https://t.co/QRXO3UqJ2p

¬†
On this #EarthDay2018, I‚Äôm inspired by what we‚Äôve shown we can achieve together‚Äî&amp; I know that a cleaner, healthier future for our planet is possible.
We‚Äôve stood together against Trump Administration officials like @EPAScottPruitt who disregard scientific consensus, &amp; have held them accountable for promoting a partisan agenda at odds with their agency‚Äôs mission to protect our environment &amp; communities. https://t.co/8OvRlVHXgP
We‚Äôve raised our voices against reckless proposals that would threaten our ecosystem, like when @SecretaryZinke initially announced plans to allow oil &amp; gas drilling in our waters before meeting a wave of opposition from passionate Washingtonians &amp; others https://t.co/xWy0SLKOfU
We‚Äôve advanced solutions for¬†key WA environmental priorities, like fixing how we fund wildfire prevention to help ensure efforts to fight &amp; prevent dangerous wildfire disasters that threaten homes, wildlife &amp; natural resources are adequately funded. https://t.co/t3hLAGn8UT
From the start, WA has helped lead the fight against the Trump Administration‚Äôs anti-environment agenda, from holding the line on important issues like combatting climate change to conducting critical research to help our communities live more sustainably. https://t.co/azCoxm2Whr
Happy #EarthDay2018! As we celebrate &amp; reaffirm our commitment to protecting our planet, it‚Äôs equally important to remember the ways we‚Äôve worked together to secure a healthier tomorrow &amp; a cleaner, more sustainable future for the next generation. Some important highlights:
From Washington state, to the other Washington‚ÄîAl Swift was a champion for the environment and our natural treasures. He helped me so much when I was elected, he worked so hard for his constituents, and his legacy will live on. -PM
These are just a few examples of what‚Äôs at stake &amp; why it‚Äôs important that we continue to make our voices heard. This Earth Day, let‚Äôs all recommit ourselves to our shared responsibility of protecting our environment from further harm #EarthDay2018
...but even more reckless, @EPAScottPruitt pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global effort to stem the growing dangers of climate change already impacting our environment &amp; a decision that will have consequences for generations to come. https://t.co/wPZycPZzo9
.@EPAScottPruitt has used his position to undermine the agency‚Äôs core mission of protecting our environment, &amp; has instead used his power to reverse commonsense environmental protections while wasting taxpayer dollars &amp; lining his allies‚Äô pockets‚Ä¶ https://t.co/kIeRj8oRrj
Speaking of drilling‚Äî@SecretaryZinke helped pave the way for hazardous oil &amp; gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge, one of our planet‚Äôs last, richest natural habitats: https://t.co/axiN1DdozN
Under President Trump, @Interior has moved to shrink or remove designations from some our prestigious national parks‚Äîcompromising vital wildlife habitats &amp; natural resources‚Äîin an effort to open up more land for additional oil &amp; gas drilling: https://t.co/unk6I09Mv1
Earlier this month, @EPA decided to roll back fuel emission standards, threatening the quality of the air we breathe &amp; undermining efforts to slow the effects of climate change: https://t.co/RGVWSrGFV2
As we approach Earth Day &amp; reflect on the beauty &amp; importance of the environment to our culture, economy &amp; lives, it is critical that we stay focused on fighting back against President Trump‚Äôs agenda that would compromise our precious ecosystem. A few recent examples:
Every student‚Äîno matter where they're from, how they learn, or how much money their parents make‚Äîdeserves a good, public education. Thank you @MandyRheaWrites, for inspiring students in Spokane every day. -PM #NTOY18 https://t.co/qe4ZgeYM9z

Women are the sole or co-breadwinner in two thirds of families with children. Without #EqualPay, many families struggle to make ends meet to pay the bills, put food on the table, and pay for child care. https://t.co/2aZ2sYAGn7
We need this Republican-led Congress to let us vote now on legislation that would make it clear to President Trump that blocking Special Counsel Mueller from continuing to follow the facts, wherever they may lead, is unacceptable‚Äî&amp; would be a clear act of obstruction of justice.
This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue, and with each passing day, it‚Äôs becoming more and more critical for Congress to immediately pass legislation to prevent special Special Counsel Mueller from being fired by President Trump without cause or court review.
Workers deserve to be paid fairly no matter their gender. It's time for Congress to act and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/HzM37UJFot

DREAMers were brought to this country as children‚Äîsome of them so young, they don‚Äôt remember it‚Äîand holding up their futures by not working with us on a solution to DACA won‚Äôt do anything to solve our broken immigration system.
Right now hundreds of thousands of young people are deferring their dreams of finishing college, becoming a doctor, buying a home, raising a family, starting a small business, or serving in our military because President Trump pulled the plug on the DACA program months ago.

I believe, anyone who is qualified should have the opportunity to serve our country, and anyone who wears our uniform to defend our freedoms deserves nothing but our country‚Äôs support and respect.
Nothing is more important than keeping our nation and families safe, and President Trump‚Äôs reckless decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military needlessly undermines our national security and values.
The $2.37B increase for child care in Congress‚Äô spending bill is a down payment on the Child Care for Working Families Act. Proud to be a cosponsor of this important bill that will ensure access to high-quality child care and early learning for all. #ChildCare4All #ChildCareNow

Our work last fall showed that we can reach agreement when we put aside partisan politics and focused on what‚Äôs best for families‚Äîand I‚Äôm ready to get back to work as soon as Republicans are.
We are not far from an agreement, I still think we can get there, and I hope Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting the amendment I am offering today‚Äîand that even if they don‚Äôt, I hope we can get back to the table and resume talks.
The bill I‚Äôm putting forward would take strong steps to lower premiums and make health care more affordable for patients‚Äîand it would uphold protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as so many Republicans and Democrats have said we should.
I‚Äôm laying out what I hope Republicans &amp; Democrats will ultimately be able to agree on‚Äîa bill that includes current-law prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion‚Äîwhat Democrats and Republicans agreed was acceptable just months ago.
I am extremely disappointed that we have reached this point‚Äîbut that does not mean I am giving up on getting this done. I know many Rs have said this is the end of the road for bipartisan negotiations on health care‚Äîbut if it is, that‚Äôs only because they have chosen that route.
Senate Republicans have opted instead to surprise Democrats with a new, last-minute partisan so-called ‚Äústabilization‚Äù bill‚Äîone that included poison bills Republicans knew Democrats would never agree to.
Democrats have been at the table and we're still at the table ready to do what we can to stabilize markets and lower families‚Äô health care costs.
Right now Republicans are trying to pass a partisan plan that would hurt women &amp; patients. I‚Äôm heading to the Senate floor to urge them to return to the table and work with Democrats to do what patients and families want: strengthen health care &amp; lower their costs next year. -PM
I am still at the table ready to keep negotiating toward a solution and I hope my Republican colleagues will reconsider and join me to get a health care deal done for patients and families.
I've worked, for months, across the aisle on legislation to help bring down premiums and undo some of the Republican health care sabotage we've seen over the last year.
It‚Äôs deeply frustrating that this week, at the last minute, Republican leaders chose to go to their partisan corner &amp; put forward their own, harmful bill that would hurt people w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; impose extreme, new restrictions on women's access to safe, legal abortion
After more than a year on the job, I would have hoped @BetsyDeVosED would have learned by now that her extreme ideas to privatize our nation‚Äôs public schools and dismantle the Department of Education do not have support among parents or in Congress. https://t.co/bMmvq8Ev63
As a former preschool teacher, I know that investing in our youngest learners isn‚Äôt just the right thing to do, it‚Äôs the smartest thing we can do‚Äîso I hope we can keep working together until high-quality, affordable early learning and care is a reality for all. #ChildCare4All
I‚Äôve heard from so many people across WA, and nationwide, about the need for more resources to combat the opioid crisis. We still have more work to do, but I‚Äôm proud we were able to work together to deliver more help for people &amp; families. https://t.co/xSyYbyPUlC

This is a bipartisan compromise in a Republican-controlled Congress &amp; Administration, but I‚Äôm glad Dems &amp; Rs were able to work together to not only reject many hateful, harmful policies from President Trump‚Äîbut also make new investments in WA, local jobs &amp; middle class priorities https://t.co/seNMsxTD5L
All workers should be paid fairly for the work they do, regardless of gender, and we should be doing everything we can to close the gender pay gap that impacts so many women nationwide‚Äîespecially women of color.

Republican leaders were unwilling to get this done for patients and families once again, but I‚Äôm going to keep working to get Republicans back to the table to work with us on health care policies that actually help deliver what people want: lower health care costs.
It‚Äôs unfortunate Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan have time and time again rejected bipartisan work on health care in favor of partisan health care politics, and chosen politically-driven show votes over getting a result for families.
With the strong support of Democratic leadership in both chambers, I‚Äôve worked with Republicans for months in good faith to try to negotiate a bipartisan agreement to lower health care costs and restore much-needed stability to health care in our country.

People who have real experience with gun violence are critical to solving this problem and they‚Äôre absolutely critical to getting anything done. Their voices should be heard. https://t.co/EfkrlbgsYd
This confirms my worst fear for President Trump's gun commission: no survivors of gun violence, families of victims, or experts on gun safety or mental health will have a voice or seat at the table. https://t.co/PXaUdCf5Jc
Just one example of priorities in this bill: making sure our VA hospitals get the investments they need to make sure veterans get the care they earned in their service to our country.
We‚Äôve worked together to restore, and in many cases even increase, investments in education, health care, and other domestic and military priorities.
Republicans have pushed us into two government shutdowns this year, but I am very hopeful that we can work together to avoid that now. We are so close to getting this done.
Following my meeting with @BetsyDeVosED last week, I have no confidence that this commission will be anything other than a tool for continued distraction and delay.

This is unacceptable. https://t.co/LP9KEkZ23c
Students, families, and teachers deserve better than this. https://t.co/V1s7aevnxV
I‚Äôm hoping my Republican colleagues will step back, reconsider, and join Democrats at the table to work together to do what members on both sides of the aisle have hoped to do for months: work together to protect families from higher premiums next year.
Unfortunately Republicans are once again putting politics ahead of patients and families with a bill that would undermine care for people with pre-existing conditions and impose harmful, last-minute restrictions on abortion coverage.
For months, Democrats have urged Republican leaders to stop standing in the way of bipartisan work to undo President Trump‚Äôs health care sabotage and lower families‚Äô health care costs. https://t.co/ILVhYT2po9
As if that weren't enough, this new partisan bill also threatens patients with pre-existing conditions by trying to lock in the Trump junk insurance plan into law. Let's get back to working together to reduce costs. https://t.co/AWRbYrSieY

@BetsyDeVosED I am hoping that Secretary DeVos gets a handle on this issue and changes her tune, but based on this meeting today, I have no confidence that President Trump‚Äôs  commission on school safety will be anything other than a tool for continued distraction and delay.
@BetsyDeVosED Sec. DeVos pushed back and asked for continued delay when I suggested that we start by quickly addressing the most common sense gun safety policies supported by the vast majority of Americans‚Äîlike universal background checks and raising the age for purchasing assault weapons.
@BetsyDeVosED In fact, Sec. DeVos told me that the only people on President Trump‚Äôs commission on gun safety would be federal officials.
@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED couldn‚Äôt tell me how quickly the commission would move, or give me any kind of clear timeline at all. She wouldn‚Äôt agree to put survivors of gun violence, families of victims, or experts on preventing gun violence on the commission.
@BetsyDeVosED While Secretary DeVos said she had no interest in meeting with the NRA as a part of this process, she couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt tell me how the NRA would be allowed to influence the commission‚Äôs recommendations, or even that they wouldn‚Äôt have veto power.
@BetsyDeVosED I was hoping Sec. DeVos would to talk to me about real, meaningful steps she could move quickly on, but everything I heard from her suggested this is just the latest effort to delay and shift the conversation away from the gun safety reforms people are demanding nationwide.
This afternoon, I met with @BetsyDeVosED to talk about her role as head of President Trump‚Äôs new commission on school safety.  I appreciated that Secretary DeVos came to meet with me, but I was extremely disappointed at how the meeting went. https://t.co/Kr89g3GbFL

Students across the country are tired of waiting for Republicans in Congress to step up and work with us to adopt common sense gun safety and other policies to end the scourge of violence in our schools and communities. The time for action is now.
Across the country, the number of opioid overdoses continues to rise. The data released by @CDCgov show our communities need resources, funding, and solutions, not more empty promises from President Trump. https://t.co/GgTYGg5fqJ
President Trump upended the lives of thousands of residents with his rash move to end DACA, &amp; since then he has rejected every bipartisan compromise to solve the problem he created‚Äîall in service of his anti-immigrant agenda.
 
That‚Äôs not leadership‚Äîthat‚Äôs brinkmanship.
I'm calling on current, former, and future students and their families to share personal stories about what they think Congress should tackle when it comes to higher education.

Dreamers came to this country through no fault of their own &amp; have lived almost their entire lives as Americans in every way but on paper. 

President Trump &amp; GOP leaders need to get serious‚Äîfinding a permanent solution to allow Dreamers to stay in the US should be a no-brainer.
.@CDCgov finds the opioid epidemic is continuing to worsen as President Trump‚Äôs empty promise to combat the crisis remains unmatched by serious action from his Administration. https://t.co/GgTYGfNEzb
This editorial from @SeattleTimes hits the nail on the head: as one of the nation‚Äôs most trade-dependent states, WA families &amp; businesses could pay a hefty price from President Trump‚Äôs reckless announcement imposing broad new tariffs. https://t.co/eCs0cUp6jl
New data from @CDCgov makes the scale of the opioid epidemic tragically clear, yet President Trump has taken no meaningful steps to fulfill his promise to tackle this crisis. https://t.co/GgTYGg5fqJ

Dreamers have waited for months for President Trump &amp; the Republican-led Congress to keep their word &amp; find a permanent legislative solution to allow them to stay in the US‚Äîit‚Äôs disgraceful that we‚Äôre still waiting for Republican leaders to honor their promise &amp; take action.
No matter how you spin it, our country won't be made stronger by removing thousands of our entrepreneurs, nurses, firefighters, teachers &amp; others giving back to our communities. Republicans in Congress must work w/ us to protect Dreamers, &amp; I won‚Äôt stop fighting to get it done.

One example of state-level innovation is the LEAD program in WA, which gives officers a tool to put people facing opioid addiction on a path to recovery instead of prison. Interested to hear about the innovative approaches in OR and MD from @OregonGovBrown and @GovLarryHogan.
We‚Äôve heard how helpful it is in fighting the opioid crisis when state data systems can talk to each other‚Äîwe need to make sure our people are talking too. Not only good data, but good ideas should be shared.
Looking forward to hearing from @OregonGovBrown and @GovLarryHogan as @HELPCmteDems discuss the role of state innovation in helping families battling opioid addiction. https://t.co/KCirpxkiIG

Today‚Äôs DACA deadline is a reminder that President Trump created this problem by rescinding protections for nearly 800K of our neighbors, loved ones &amp; friends, and then sabotaged every bipartisan agreement or compromise to clean up the mess he made.

Patients deserve an explanation from Aetna about these alarming reports. It is unacceptable that a patient would have coverage denied because of their insurer‚Äôs carelessness. https://t.co/Jl6PcsLwol
Scott Lloyd and his ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù process of denying women reproductive rights are a threat to the young women his office is supposed to care for. He needs to resign immediately. https://t.co/r06GZ9Db4P
The Trump-Pence Administration should not be denying young women their reproductive rights or limiting access to safe, legal abortion through an ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù process‚Äîor through any process for that matter. ORR Director Scott Lloyd has got to go. https://t.co/dXwth9b9s4

The @NEAarts and @NEHgov support vibrant artists and works that enrich so many lives and make our nation a cultural touchstone for the world. That legacy deserves continued bipartisan support against President Trump's proposed cuts.
Dreamers are the embodiment of so much of what this country was founded upon &amp; today we have a new chance to finally fix our broken immigration system for Dreamers in WA &amp; nationwide who call our country home.
Or Dreamers like one Pasco, WA resident who was 4 when he was flown to the U.S. Years later, after he enrolled in DACA, he was able to quit working in manual labor &amp; start a new job as a personal banker. 

Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers have a similar story.
DREAMers like Jose Manuel, who grew up in South Seattle‚Äî&amp; didn‚Äôt know he wasn‚Äôt a natural-born citizen until he went to get a driver‚Äôs license. 

Thanks to DACA, Jose Manuel was able to graduate from @UW, start a tech business, &amp; volunteer at local non-profits.
Who are Dreamers? Dreamers are determined, passionate, &amp; American in every way except on paper. 

They are fighting for the only lives they‚Äôve ever known. 

They are fighting for their loved ones with everything they‚Äôve got‚Äîand they are trying to do it the right way.
To start, Dreamers‚Äîthousands of our friends &amp; neighbors, teachers &amp; firefighters, servicemembers &amp; students‚Äîare not criminals, MS-13 gang members, nor are they a drain on our economy.
Finding a bipartisan path forward to both secure our borders and protect the futures of so many hardworking families is why we are here. 

Creating a more perfect union is why we are here.

First though, we must agree to some basic truths:
As the Senate opens up debate on immigration, heading down to the floor to urge my colleagues to come together &amp; find a bipartisan solution to protect Dreamers.
It was nice to hear an honest answer from OMB Dir. Mulvaney in the budget hearing today. I asked if he would vote for President Trump‚Äôs budget if he were in Congress, and he said that he wouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs one thing we agree on! ‚ÄìPM

‚ÄúBut Director Mulvaney‚Äîthis is anything but a normal budget and Budget Committee hearing."
‚ÄúIf this were a normal Budget Committee hearing, I may even praise some of the attention that is finally being paid to tackling our opioids crisis.‚Äù

Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House‚Äîbut they have committed to working with us to finally pass immigration legislation, and I am going to keep fighting to protect DREAMers and their families and to hold Republicans accountable until this gets done.
This isn‚Äôt what I would have written on my own, and I know it‚Äôs not the bill Republicans would have written on their own‚Äîbut it‚Äôs an important step forward in this Republican Congress to invest in and protect families, patients, and communities.
By increasing investments in education, health care, infrastructure, and other middle class &amp; national security priorities, this budget deal is a step away from the constant crises we‚Äôve seen far too much of in this Republican Congress.
I want to be very clear: this budget deal is a good step, but cannot be the end of our bipartisan work.

It‚Äôs shameful that the Trump administration continues to prioritize Big Oil &amp; the relentless pursuit of profit over the interest of Washington state families, despite years of fact-finding &amp; public input establishing the need to protect our ecologically-sensitive coasts.
Not only is the Trump Administration‚Äôs move to open WA‚Äôs coasts to dangerous oil &amp; gas drilling completely unnecessary‚Äîit flies in the face of what‚Äôs in the best interest of WA families &amp; w/o regard to what it may mean for our environment, public health, or economy.
Proud to join my colleagues to send a clear message to @SecretaryZinke &amp; @Interior: our coastal waters are too important to our environment &amp; economy to risk the dangers posed by expanded oil &amp; gas drilling.

The way we finance higher education by asking everyone to take on debt is sending a clear message that college is for the wealthy‚Äînot the students who have the most to gain. https://t.co/G3ohqIZgaS
There are so many reasons why college has gotten so expensive, but the results remain the same. Student debt stops people from buying houses, starting families, opening their own businesses, and continuing their education.

I‚Äôd like to think that after almost half a century we could move on from debating this settled issue. There is no one qualified to interfere with decisions that a woman has the Constitutional right to make on her own. https://t.co/kONR982xSY
This investigation isn‚Äôt about politics‚Äîthis is about the integrity of our elections, our national security, and our standing around the world. No one should stand in the way of a thorough investigation.
As I‚Äôve said from the outset, it is critical that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is able to continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead‚Äîwithout threats or intimidation, and with all the resources he needs‚Äîso the American people get the full explanation they deserve.
This partisan exercise is not only self-serving &amp; extraordinarily reckless, it‚Äôs deeply damaging to the public‚Äôs faith in our institutions &amp; to the men and women who go to work every day to keep us safe from harm. President Trump‚Äôs complicity in this release is disgraceful.
The American people deserve the truth about Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election, and they deserve to have confidence that their government is committed to preventing such interference from a foreign power ever happening again.
I join my colleagues in saying that using the Nunes Memo as pretext to fire Rosenstein or Mueller would be viewed as an attempt to obstruct justice and would cause a Constitutional crisis.
This isn‚Äôt about transparency, this is just another attempt to undermine and discredit the Russia investigation, Deputy AG Rosenstein, and the hard-working men &amp; women of the FBI ‚Äî and another attempt to protect President Trump.
President Trump may claim that he wants to treat the opioid crisis as a public health emergency, but his actions show this is just another broken promise. https://t.co/Ws7T0F0KXl

Republicans in Congress could easily pass a bipartisan compromise that protects DREAMers &amp; other young people who came to the country as children &amp; call the US home.  There‚Äôs no reason we shouldn‚Äôt be able to get this done.
Not only does the Trump Administration want to allow employers to steal workers tips, new reports show they knew it was bad for workers and hid the evidence. https://t.co/PKeIwRkdAb

While WA families wait on Republicans in Congress to renew funding for community health centers &amp; figure out a bipartisan solution to protect DREAMers, President Trump seems more concerned w touting his tax cuts for wealthy families &amp; huge corporations. https://t.co/yQq3t7Q0R9
DREAMers work, eat, sleep, shop, worship, raise families, protect our streets &amp; live their lives as Americans‚Äîand our country is made stronger by their contributions to our communities.

This is a stark example of how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to pad the pockets of business interests at the expense of workers. https://t.co/eAkIgqzvBt
Now that their real priorities have been exposed, President Trump should tell Secretary Acosta to abandon this effort immediately.

President Trump has spent his first year in office breaking the promises he made during his campaign, so it‚Äôs hard to take his new promises today too seriously. #SOTU
Reminder: President Trump promised to address the opioid crisis, but has repeatedly failed to identify any additional funding to battle the opioid epidemic. #SOTU
$25 billion could construct 11,000 water projects to repair and upgrade drinking water and sewer systems nationwide, and create more than 500,000 construction jobs. #BuildABetterAmerica #SOTU
Instead of President Trump‚Äôs wall, we could invest $25 billion to combat the #opioid epidemic, improve our schools, and repair our infrastructure. #SOTU
We need to be creating good, American jobs while addressing our nation‚Äôs aging infrastructure, not finding another excuse to line the pockets of big businesses &amp; the ultra-wealthy &amp; rolling back critical clean water and labor standards that keep families and workers safe. #SOTU
Let me be clear: If Trump‚Äôs version of infrastructure investment is simply a cover for privatization, increasing costs on the backs of American families, cutting vital programs, and undermining good middle class jobs, then we will fight it every step of the way. #SOTU
President Trump promised to improve health care, but instead has sabotaged it at every opportunity and undermined care for millions across the country. #SOTU
When President Trump asks "How's your 401k?" does he know nearly half our families don't have a retirement account? We need solutions to help them plan for the future, not empty words. #SOTU
Let‚Äôs not forget that those tax cuts for massive corporations are permanent, while working families get just crumbs that last only a few years. #SOTU https://t.co/ikHZVbfpAo
The tax plan that Republicans and President Trump jammed through Congress gave massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, biggest corporations, President Trump, his family, and the vast majority of his cabinet. #SOTU
Despite President Trump's campaign promises to put workers' first, too many workers have not seen wages go up and still have to work two or three jobs just to get by. #SOTU

We cannot allow schools colleges to close the door on the students who have the most to gain from higher education simply because they may face additional challenges than their more advantaged peers.
In short, students should be better off‚Äînot worse off‚Äîafter enrolling in college. https://t.co/227ECP5HYd

‚úì providing access to higher ed to everyone who wants it;
‚úì ensuring students are able to learn in a safe environment;
‚úì and preparing students for success after college.
This should go w/o saying, but DREAMers &amp; other young people who were brought to this country as children are American in nearly every way &amp; make invaluable contributions to our communities‚Äîit would be cruel &amp; foolish to turn our backs on them now. #DefendDACA

We need someone who will fight to lower drug prices, however Azar has a long history of personally working to raise them as a pharmaceutical executive.
After Secretary Price resigned in scandal, I hoped President Trump would learn his lesson and nominate someone who would put families and patients first. But instead he chose someone who will put harmful ideology first.

I'm glad we were able to pass an extension of CHIP, but we need to work together to make sure patients and families who rely on community health centers, teaching health centers, and other critical health investments can continue to get the care they need.
I'm glad Republican leaders have committed to working with us to deliver on some of the challenges facing the families we represent. But in the coming weeks people will be looking to action‚Äîand true bipartisan work‚Äînot just words.
While it‚Äôs good that Republican leaders were able to keep the lights on for a few more weeks, to be very clear‚Äîwe need to do a whole lot more than the bare minimum.

My full statement on ending this Republican shutdown and the path forward for a long-term deal. https://t.co/UCGOdJo9iJ
This has been a year of chaos and dysfunction. Of bullying and attacks. Of hatred, division, controversy, and crises.#TrumpShutdown
Just one year ago President Trump was sworn into office promising the American people that he would break through the gridlock to get results for workers and families. This past year has proven quite the opposite. https://t.co/PNhrJqORpQ
Tune in: https://t.co/jOjmxKKTw4 https://t.co/jVMKpRdzs6
I‚Äôm heading to the Senate Floor to call on Republicans to end this Trump Shutdown‚Äîand work with Democrats to actually solve the problems we face. -PM
This shutdown is a choice made by Republicans‚Äîthe Party that controls the Senate, the House, and the White House. It is a choice made through their inaction‚Äîmonths and months of refusing to work with Democrats.
This government shutdown will impact the way that people nationwide have access to the care they need. https://t.co/qq1PQbSqpg
We have spent months and months‚Äîand really, years and years‚Äîpushing Republicans to work with us to protect the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers across the country.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to increase investments in education, health care, and other domestic and defense priorities.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass support for our veterans‚Äîto combat opioid and substance use disorder.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass disaster relief for the families and communities who have been hit so hard.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass funding for community health centers that so many families depend on.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass a long-term extension of the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program that gives millions of kids access to care.
On the heels of so much utter dysfunction and disarray coming from this Republican government‚Äîit is fitting, even while deeply disappointing, that President Trump‚Äôs first year has ended with him pushing our country into a completely unnecessary #Trumpshutdown
It was just one year ago that President Trump was sworn into office promising the American people that he that he would break through the gridlock to get results for workers and families. #TrumpShutdown
This weekend is the anniversary of the #WomensMarch, and as I‚Äôm in the other Washington fighting the Trump shutdown, seeing so many pictures from family and friends at marches this year is inspiring. Here‚Äôs one of mine from last year‚Äîcan you share yours from this weekend? https://t.co/6s92Z8yaEP
This shutdown will impact families &amp; communities in WA &amp; nationwide if it's not ended quickly--it's time for Republicans to put people and families above partisanship and politics.
Now that Republicans have shut down the government, I am going to be doing everything I can to persuade the Republican majority to reopen the government and get to work with us.
Instead of working with us to get a result, President Trump and Republican leaders who control the House and Senate were more focused on pointing fingers and playing political games.
This is no way to run the government and no way to treat families looking to Congress for solutions, not dysfunction and uncertainty. #TrumpShutdown
One year ago, millions and millions of people across the country stood up at Women‚Äôs Marches nationwide to make clear that we were going to fight back against President Trump and his agenda https://t.co/8PdEeB8OXU
I am hopeful Republican leaders hear from the people they represent and reconsider this deeply damaging approach.
Now, here we are, on the brink of a crisis and they are more focused on playing politics than on working with us. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/RovXrYCRr4
Reminder: Republicans spent the last months of 2017 jamming tax breaks through for the wealthiest few, rather than working with Democrats to get real results.
President‚Äôs latest action to appease his extreme, right-wing base will deny women &amp; men basic care they need &amp; it's a direct attack on a woman‚Äôs constitutionally protected right to access safe, legal abortion care &amp; make her own choices about her own body. https://t.co/PW0f5pUtnL
Hours away from a potential Republican government shutdown, The Trump Administration is working to take health care away from millions of patients and undermine women‚Äôs reproductive rights, instead of doing even the bare minimum to keep the doors of government open. https://t.co/x5gepUmD1q

I am at the table and ready to get to work with anyone, from any Party, who is willing to work with those of us truly interested in getting results and passing legislation that keeps our government open and addresses the critical challenges facing our children and families.
Republicans and President Trump have pushed us from one short-term spending bill to the next. And now they are pushing us to the brink of a crisis. They‚Äôre more focused on playing politics than on working with us to get results.
Republican leaders have spent months refusing to work with Democrats on a long-term extension of the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program. They have blocked every effort to protect DREAMers in Washington state and across the country.
Democrats have made it clear we want to keep the government open to continue negotiations and reach a good result. If Republicans reject that and shut down the government, they'll be held accountable by people who will be paying the price for GOP dysfunction. #TrumpShutdown
There is absolutely no reason for the Republicans who control government to shut it down, and I am hoping they reverse course and work with us‚Äîtoday‚Äîto prevent that.
Reminder: Republicans spent the last year sabotaging health care &amp; twisting arms to pass a massive giveaway to billionaire families &amp; corporations‚Äîat the expense of working people‚Äîwhile they could have been passing legislation to fully-fund CHIP.
We shouldn't even be having this discussion. President Trump &amp; Republicans have said before that they support fully-funding CHIP &amp; protecting young people from deportation who have lived almost their entire lives in the US. https://t.co/rIrMb0Vy7R

Far too many students are held back from even applying to schools because it is simply not affordable. Navigating our complex financial aid system can be overwhelming‚Äî especially for first generation students.

It's time to come together to beat the scourge of opioid addiction &amp; enact solutions that are as comprehensive as this challenge.
Combatting the opioid epidemic will take an enormous investment of time, energy, focus, and funding. And President Trump's third quarter paycheck isn't going to cut it.

The Trump Administration has so far run @HHSGov with one goal: imposing its harmful ideology on patients, women, &amp; families‚Äîand I have serious doubts President Trump‚Äô nominee to lead it, Mr. Azar, is willing to stand up and put the needs of patients and families first.
From going to college to starting a new business, DACA has helped thousands of young men &amp; women realize their dreams &amp; make invaluable contributions to our communities.

It‚Äôs been 100 days since #CHIP funding expired. That's 100 days of uncertainty for families across the country. It‚Äôs time for Republicans to work with us on a funding solution for CHIP now.

While families in WA impacted by addiction wait for additional resources to curb the #opioidcrisis, the Trump administration misguidedly chooses to focus on cracking down on legal marijuana use instead.

We have a bipartisan path forward for the nearly 800,000 young people left in limbo right now with the #DreamAct. It‚Äôs past time for Republican leadership to step up to address this Trump-inflicted mess.

This is no way to run the government and no way to treat people who are looking to Congress for solutions and I am going to do everything I can to make sure this Republican-controlled Congress does its job for our young people and families without any further delay.
It‚Äôs unacceptable for Republicans to leave town with people across the country still waiting for an end to the uncertainty they are facing right now, on everything from the DREAM Act to whether their children will have health care in a few months.
This Republican-led Congress has used the vast majority of the year trying to take away health care from millions of Americans &amp; jamming through tax cuts for the rich‚Äîall while leaving middle class priorities on the backburner.
I voted NO on the Republicans' short-term spending bill, and I want to be very clear on why: families deserve better.
No one should stand in the way of a thorough investigation. I applaud my colleague @MarkWarner for being so vigilant. https://t.co/LFZzDKdFGv
Every single day Republican leaders refuse to bring the DREAM Act to the floor for a vote, another 122 young people‚Äîour neighbors, students, coworkers &amp; friends‚Äîlose their DACA status‚Äîand could be forced from the only country they know.
That‚Äôs why we need more members of Congress‚Äîon both sides of the aisle‚Äîready to roll up their sleeves and get this done.
We may not be able to change the Trump Administration‚Äôs hateful rhetoric or short-sighted policies overnight, but we can and should pass the DREAM Act as soon as possible.
But there is one thing that unites not only a large, bipartisan contingent in Congress, but also the vast majority of the American people‚Äîfinding a path forward for the estimated 800,000 young men &amp; women, incl. nearly 17K in WA, whose lives are in limbo. https://t.co/InPtZUclOr
From health care to tax reform, some days it feels impossible to get the majority of Republicans on-board with policies that truly help the families we represent‚Ä¶.
I'm heading to the Senate floor to call on my Republican colleagues to follow through on promise to fix DACA for the 800,000 young men &amp; women whose lives are right now in limbo.
This fight is not over &amp; I hope you‚Äôll join me in continuing to hold Republicans accountable for their votes‚Äîand to work with Democrats to reverse the pieces of this legislation that so heavily tip the scales to the wealthiest.
While I am deeply disappointed President Trump &amp; Republicans succeeded in jamming their destructive bill through w/o real hearings‚ÄîI am so proud of the millions of people from every corner of this country who made their voices heard &amp; did everything they could.
It‚Äôs hard to overstate the hypocrisy of so-called fiscal conservatives who didn‚Äôt think twice about blowing a massive hole in our deficit and endangering Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid‚Äîall so they could gift tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy and the Trump family.
From the millions who will lose health coverage or see their premiums go up, to the middle class families who will see their tax bill increase, to the pristine region of Alaska that will open to drilling, it‚Äôs hard to overstate the cruelty of the Trump-Republican bill.

As Republicans rush to jam through their partisan, reckless tax bill, here‚Äôs a quick reminder of some of the headlines we‚Äôve seen about who will win and who will lose:
I am calling on Republicans‚Äîone last time‚Äîto slow down, work with us, and get this done right. Democrats are sitting at the table and ready to get to work.
People across the country have spoken loud and clear‚Äîthey don‚Äôt want this Republican tax bill. But they‚Äôre still not listening.
Instead of working out in the open on this tax plan‚ÄîRepublicans worked in back rooms, where nobody could see what they were doing. And they didn‚Äôt listen to actual middle class families who would be impacted.
Democrats were ready to work across the aisle, we wanted a seat at the table. We wanted to give tax cuts to the middle class &amp; close some of the  egregious loopholes used by the wealthy and well-connected. Republicans refused.
You know, tax reform didn‚Äôt have to be partisan. It didn‚Äôt have to be a fight.
Just one year into this Presidency and we‚Äôve seen nothing but broken promises to working families. So I wish I could say what we see in this tax bill is shocking, but sadly, at this point‚Äîit‚Äôs expected.
Republicans need to think about the damage they are causing to the middle class, our economy, our national debt, and our health care‚Äîand change course, right now. https://t.co/RNgRv3BYx6
Our communities need much more than what will ‚Äútrickle down‚Äù from the GOP‚Äôs huge tax cuts for the wealthiest families &amp; corporations. It‚Äôs not too late for Republicans to reverse course &amp; work on a plan that actually helps working people https://t.co/jHVdTUlmQQ

I want to extend my sincere gratitude for the many first responders who rushed to the scene and worked to help others in their time of need.
In the coming hours, days, and weeks, investigators will be looking into what caused this terrible tragedy and provide the answers to the many outstanding questions we all have about what happened and why.
I‚Äôm contacting officials on the ground to make clear that I am ready to help in any way possible at the federal level.
It‚Äôs been a tough day in WA‚Äîand my heart goes out to the families who lost a loved one today, to the many more who were injured in this morning‚Äôs derailment, and to all of those who remain uncertain and concerned about the full scope of the tragedy.
Heartbroken by the news coming out of WA right now. As my staff works to get more info, my thoughts are w/ everyone affected, including the 1st responders doing their best to keep people safe. ‚ÄìPM

DREAMers were brought to this country as children‚Äîsome of them so young, they don‚Äôt remember it. Holding up their futures or sending them to a country they‚Äôve never known does nothing to solve our broken immigration system. #DreamAct
There‚Äôs nothing stopping Republicans from passing a clean #DreamAct &amp; keeping the promise we made to nearly 800K of our friends, co-workers &amp; loved ones. All that‚Äôs necessary is the political will to do what‚Äôs right &amp; treat others w respect &amp; dignity. https://t.co/0hymubBosf
We will not forget who and what comes first in the Trump/Republican agenda. #NetNeutralty https://t.co/WVkv6wljWV
.@AjitPaiFCC‚Äôs decision to roll back net neutrality rules affects many of the millions of people who spoke out against this decision‚Äîfrom students and families, to small business owners and the next generation of innovators.
Despite the pleas of millions of Americans, President Trump‚Äôs FCC voted to change the internet as we know it, and turn it into yet another money-making tool for large corporations. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/zGnRAE94Sj
President Trump &amp; @ajitpaifcc want to put larger profits for large corporations over a free &amp; open internet, available to all. We need to fight to keep #NetNeutrality rules.
And that‚Äôs just the start to the list of damages this horrific plan would do to families and the economy. https://t.co/Zii8wSCSfA
Let‚Äôs be clear about what the GOP tax plan would do:

It would gift the wealthiest &amp; biggest corporations with a tax cut, raise taxes on the middle class, increase health premiums, blast a massive hole in our deficit, &amp; put Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; Social Security in danger.
This has been a sham partisan process‚Äîa brazen partisan attempt to jam through a tax plan that would devastate our economy with as little scrutiny or debate as possible‚Äîand this dog-and-pony show of regular order today isn‚Äôt fooling anyone. #GOPTaxScam
Internet access is especially critical in our rural areas, and we should be doing everything we can to make it affordable and accessible to all. Protect #Netneutrality.
Future generations should have access to enjoy the same public lands that we do. Protecting the wonder of the #ArcticRefuge from drilling is one of many reasons we must fight the GOP‚Äôs tax scam.
We must stand w our Dreamers &amp; immigrant communities &amp; raise our voices to push back against policies &amp; rhetoric that hurt our friends, neighbors, coworkers, students &amp; loved ones. #DreamAct
Another symptom of Republican's rushed, partisan tax plan? It could potentially devastate the Arctic Refuge, one of our nation‚Äôs last natural treasures. #ProtectTheArctic https://t.co/4JxQ3agVGT
Working families across the country have made their voices heard against higher taxes. This isn‚Äôt the time to rush the bill. GOP should slow down &amp; wait for Senator-Elect Doug Jones to be seated.
The @FCC needs to delay its vote on #NetNeutrality until it examines the way this could harm our nation‚Äôs students and schools‚Äîespecially those in rural and low-income communities. https://t.co/UPohlaPJRw https://t.co/mVU83mPr2Y
Republicans should take a step back and halt their partisan, rushed tax plan until Senator-elect Jones is seated. The voices of the people of Alabama should be heard.
Tonight, people across Alabama stood up and loudly rejected one of the most troubling and unfit candidates for Senate that I can recall‚Äîand they just as loudly rejected efforts by President Trump and Republicans to put this person in office.
I‚Äôm pleased, and so relieved, to welcome Doug Jones to the Senate‚Äîwhere I believe he‚Äôll have so much to contribute as we fight to grow the economy and increase opportunities for workers and middle class families across the country.
To my Republican colleagues: Don‚Äôt be a rubber stamp for this president‚Äôs hateful agenda or his obvious disdain for the rule of law. Vote no on these judicial nominees.
With that principle in mind, I strongly oppose the three nominees for the Circuit Court whose nominations are before the United States Senate this week. https://t.co/zj4BmSb2Ly
The men and women of the judicial bench are often the final gatekeepers of our nation‚Äôs justice system‚Äîand the right kind of judge shows up to work every day to make the system work for every citizen, free from prejudice or bias.
We can‚Äôt stop until we get this across the finish line‚Äîwe owe it to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in WA &amp; nationwide fighting to live life out of the shadows. #DREAMAct https://t.co/whaQgvLkpK

@wsu It‚Äôs not easy to speak up in these uncertain times‚Äîwe owe our thanks to the countless DACA recipients who have bravely shared their stories, in WA &amp; across our great nation, to highlight the critical importance of this fight to our communities. #DreamAct
@wsu A business owner who applied for DACA shared that he was proud to finish his college degree &amp; contribute his education, skills and taxes back to the WA economy. Now, his fate is uncertain. #DreamAct
Another young person, a @WSU sophomore, plans to graduate in 2019 &amp; was able to get a job helping adults with disabilities. Ending DACA throws her plans into chaos. #DreamAct

It‚Äôs time for us as elected representatives to hold ourselves to a higher standard, to set an example, and to live a set of values that is truly representative and worthy of the Congress, our democracy, and our great country.
Respecting women as equals and not as objects is critical. Sexual harassment, or assault, or in any way using your power to demean women cannot be tolerated. I want my colleagues, my staff, my constituents, and especially my granddaughters to know that is not acceptable.
For some time I have talked about returning the word respect to our language, to our actions, and to our politics. That has to start at the top. We must lead by example.

President Trump has weakened health &amp; safety protections for workers‚Äîopening the door for companies to put their employees‚Äô lives and livelihoods at risk to maximize their profits.
After more than a year on the campaign trail of telling workers he would put them first, the Trump Administration has done the exact opposite‚Äîand prioritized corporations‚Äô profits over their employees.
.@usedgov has worked every day to implement the vision of Trump: Rolling back protections for transgender students,

Revoking guidance that protects women &amp; helps bring perpetrators of sexual assault to justice,

Halting investigations into systemic discrimination.
This shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise. This is a President who kicked off his campaign by calling Mexicans criminals...
Who called for a ban on all Muslims coming to America...
Who openly ridiculed a journalist with a disability...
Who has openly demeaned women...
And so much more...
One of the most appalling ways President Trump has damaged our country is when it comes to civil rights &amp; undermining the rights and safety of women, people of color, and people with disabilities.

From tax cuts, to health care, to any other issue‚Äîit‚Äôs clear @POTUS will leave no stone unturned in his quest make the rich richer, chipping away at tribal treaty rights, undermining efforts to combat climate change, &amp; leaving middle class families behind. https://t.co/ha7UORnDHs
@SenateGOP Republicans still have a chance to stand up to President Trump, listen to their constituents, step back from this terrible anti-middle class tax bill.
@SenateGOP If anyone was still under any illusion that Republicans were concerned about the middle class, fiscal responsibility, or working together‚Äîthat ended in the early morning hours of Saturday.
Reminder: The tax bill @SenateGOP passed in the dead of night would cause 13 million people to lose health care coverage &amp; increase costs‚Äîall so that massive corporations get more tax breaks they don‚Äôt need. https://t.co/415OP37aKF
.@SenateGOP succeeded in rushing their disastrous tax bill through before we even had a chance to read it, but the fight isn't over.

Republicans voted to increase taxes on the middle class, raise premiums for patients, threaten Medicare &amp; Social Security, open up ANWR to drilling, and blow a massive hole in the deficit‚Äîall to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy few. https://t.co/KojOxEKO89
In the middle of the night, @SenateGOP once again made it clear that their highest priority is handing more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.
Republicans are jamming this devastating tax bill through before anyone has any time to read it, and they‚Äôre hoping  people and families across the country aren‚Äôt watching.

Tune in: https://t.co/YGD6erIesQ
Republicans aren‚Äôt stopping. They just voted to keep rushing this bill through and raise taxes on working families to give corporations and President Trump a tax break. https://t.co/roz8e8tUKg

Let me be clear: Republicans are jamming this tax plan through to give tax breaks to corporations, President Trump, his family, and the vast majority of his cabinet.

To my Republican colleagues: you are far down this road, but you can turn around. It‚Äôs not too late to do the right thing. https://t.co/yqT0dVFQX5
Republicans said this tax plan would lower taxes for the middle class‚Äîit won‚Äôt. They claim it will create jobs‚Äîexperts say the exact opposite.
Here‚Äôs the truth: Republicans want to spend the savings from taking away millions of people‚Äôs health care to pay for tax cuts for those at the top -- for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations.
It is astonishing just how far my Republican colleagues are willing to run from the truth in order to jam this terrible tax bill through Congress.
There's still time. Republicans can stop this attempt to rush their disastrous tax plan through. I'm heading to the Senate floor to remind them once again.
People are making their voices heard loud &amp; clear! In just the last 48 hours, my office has received over 2,000 calls from Washingtonians opposing the @SenateGOP tax plan ‚Äîless than 20 have called in support.
@Senate_GOP So as Republicans continue hurdling towards a vote on a bill that will raise taxes on working people, spike health care premiums, and rip vital investments from our communities‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget who will win, and who will lose.
@Senate_GOP We don‚Äôt have to do this. We don‚Äôt have to take money from working people &amp; give it to the richest families &amp; wealthiest organizations. But no matter how Republicans try to spin it, that‚Äôs what their bill does.
@Senate_GOP Again, these are just a handful of thousands of stories shared by Washingtonians‚Äîbut the GOP tax plan will raise taxes for millions more &amp; pave the way for cuts to critical programs like Social Security &amp; Medicaid. And that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg.
@Senate_GOP These are real stories of real Washingtonians who will suffer real consequences under the GOP tax plan‚Äîall while billions of dollars will funnel from those who need it most to those who need it least.

Maybe for millionaires, billionaires, and corporations‚Äîbut not for working families.
With this tax plan, it's clear Republican leaders are absolutely committed to giving the wealthiest &amp; biggest corporations a massive tax cut‚Äîwhile asking workers, patients, and middle class families to foot the bill.

It's time for our bipartisan health care bill to move to the floor as quickly as possible, without any attempts to sabotage it or use it as political cover to jam legislation through that would be devastating for patients and families.
Republicans should listen and back away from their plan to pay for tax cuts for the rich by spiking families‚Äô premiums, cutting millions of people off of coverage, and injecting even more uncertainty into peoples‚Äô health care.

House Republicans are voting on a bill that would allow politicians in Washington, D.C. to interfere with the most personal decisions a woman can make.
There is never a good time for politicians to try to tell women what they can and can‚Äôt do with their own bodies. Never.

Many people may be saying now is not the time to talk about gun safety, but like so many moms and dads in our country, I want to know ‚Äì if not now, when?
We can't and shouldn't sit by as innocent Americans suffer rampant gun violence that is unmatched in any other country in the world.
I refuse to believe the politics are too tough to come together on common sense policies &amp; do whatever we possibly can to keep our children safe.
None of us should fall back on justifications, blame, or tweeted thoughts and prayers and think we‚Äôve done enough to keep our families, friends and neighbors safe.
No parent should have to worry whether their child will return home safe from a day at school. No child should have to worry about whether their parent will return home safe from a night at a concert.
This violence is happening in every corner of our country, including Washington state, where families are still dealing with a deadly shooting that happened barely 2 weeks ago.
As a mother and grandmother myself, my heart hurts for the many parents who got the call that their child is among the victims.
Deeply saddened by news in Las Vegas. My heart is with the victims, their families, first responders, &amp; everyone impacted by this horrific violence.
I hope President Trump takes this opportunity to select a new Secretary of Health and Human Services who will truly put patients and families first. -PM
