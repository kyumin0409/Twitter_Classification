Russia’s continuing bad actions on world stage are only latest reason @realDonaldTrump should NOT hold summit with Putin.

Today on #Thanksgiving, let us remember that there is more that unites us than divides us. Let us put country before party. And let us remember that we are not red or blue or purple; we are Americans.
I’m thankful for the men and women serving our country overseas and deployed at home and who can’t be with their families this #Thanksgiving.  Thank you.
After two years, this is what we have: a President who struts around, and surrounds himself with sycophants, and spouts off obvious lies and ridiculous superlatives about himself like a tin-pot dictator. Thankfully, we’re the USA and not a two-bit dictatorship.
I’m thankful for Obamacare establishing a Patient Bill of Rights that protects millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. It’s our job to strengthen those protections—not gut them. #Thanksgiving

In recent years, we’ve seen incredibly disturbing attacks on journalists around the globe—from Jamal #Khashoggi’s brutal murder, to the imprisonment of Reuters reporters who were simply doing their jobs trying to report on atrocities against the Rohingya in Burma.
Last night, @SenateGOP blocked a bill to #ProtectMueller. This morning’s Twitter tirade by @realDonaldTrump proves why we must put our country above party. NOBODY is above the law. Not the President’s family, not his campaign operatives, and certainly not the President himself.

Instead, President Trump chose to skip the opportunity to honor the thousands of brave Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice for a free world on the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. Why? Because it was raining.
Congress designated today as Veterans Day in 1919 to mark the sacrifice of the millions of heroes who have served our great nation. Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump was in France to commemorate the end of the “war to end all wars” with other world leaders.

This order is especially cruel because this admin has made a point of turning away asylum seekers at ports of entry. I know because I’ve seen it with my own eyes. This order has nothing to do with punishing illegal immigration, and everything to do with making asylum illegal.
These asylum seekers are real people – desperate men, women and children coming to us looking for safety. For many, their lives are at risk and turning our backs on them can be a death sentence. But this isn’t just about them – it’s about us. https://t.co/Y4ZQiATKYv

It is more important than ever that those of us who believe in the dignity and opportunity for all people, and the importance of coming together to solve our real problems, keep battling for our vision of America.
By changing the majority party in the House of Representatives, the American people have made it clear: We are one nation. The hate and bigotry and division must end.
The American people rejected the calls for hate and fear, and voted for hope and opportunity.
Stand up and make your voice heard. We will not sit back and let our country continue to go down a dark path. Do not lose hope. Do not be silent.
The tax cuts for the wealthy have made our deficit soar, and now Republicans are using that as an excuse to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare. This is disgraceful and would devastate the hardworking Americans who depend on these programs day in and day out.
Republicans have voted literally dozens of times to eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. It is up to us to fight for the people whose lives depend on this. VOTE!
No excuses. You are an American citizen, go VOTE!
Our nation was founded for “We The People.”

But if we, the people, don’t vote, the powerful win out. You have a duty — a responsibility.

So get out the door, and Walk, Run, Roll or Drive. But get to the poll and VOTE!

Raining? Take an umbrella.

A long line? Take a book.
Resist. PERSIST! And VOTE today!
Today is a pivotal election and one of the most important elections in a generation. Be bold. Make your voices heard. The world is watching us.
Make no mistake: Republicans will use every trick possible to gut safety net programs to fund their huge tax cuts for the rich. We can’t let that happen.

.@realDonaldTrump’s #GOPTaxScam raised the deficit by 17% from the previous year. Now Republicans are now using their deficit as an excuse to cut Social Security and Medicare—which are literally the difference between life and death for millions of Americans.

Thank you @OregonGovBrown for standing up for Oregon's coastal communities. Offshore drilling would jeopardize our fishing and tourism industries while fueling climate chaos.  This should be a no-brainer.  (@realDonaldTrump and Zinke, I'm talking to you.)

These words ring eerily true as we watch @realDonaldTrump and his State Dept fail to take a strong stand on Khashoggi’s death. If America won’t stand up for human rights and freedom of the press, who will? https://t.co/lXRMywH1wt
In a powerful final @washingtonpost column—just published—Jamal Khashoggi worried that crackdowns on a free press may “no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community. Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence.”
We need to send a powerful message that America stands up for human rights everywhere in the world and that Khashoggi’s murder is unacceptable. We need to find out what happened. https://t.co/lXLWvXa9rG

Meanwhile, our president is repeating the Saudis’ flailing attempts to explain away this horrific act.  
How about seeking truth and accountability instead of coverups?

I hope this isn’t true, but if it is, it is profoundly wrong.

Thank you to the brave survivors who came forward with their stories about sexual assault.  You’re an inspiration to all of us. #SundayMotivation
Today’s outcome makes it that much more difficult to reclaim our We the People democracy—but let it be a call to action for every American who cares about saving government of, by, and for the people.
I am deeply troubled by the signal the Senate has sent today by confirming Brett Kavanaugh instead of heeding their words.
They were looking to the Senate to stand up for survivors, and to send a clear message that treating any fellow human being this way is unacceptable behavior for someone seeking the privilege of a seat on the Supreme Court.
Over the last several weeks, I have heard from countless survivors of sexual assault and abuse. Many of these individuals saw their own stories reflected in the experiences of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez.
Today is a dark day for America. An individual totally unsuited to the bench has been confirmed to the Supreme Court, harming the integrity and the legitimacy of our courtsystem.
Last night and early this morning, I shared the powerful and compelling stories from more than 30 Oregon sexual assault survivors on the Senate Floor. I am so grateful to the strong women who offered their experiences. Thank you for your courage.
Congrats on your Nobel Peace Prize @NadiaMuradBasee and @DenisMukwege. Sexual violence and assault have no place in the world.  I am reminded today of the determination and resilience of so many out there working for a better future for their country and the world.
This is a fight for the heart and soul of our country. It’s time to save America. https://t.co/UwRQlIvqta

The entire message to every woman in America is that if you bring your story forward, and if Republicans are in charge, they will hire a prosecutor and treat you like a criminal. You won’t be heard or believed. And you won’t be treated like the patriot that you are.
I’m furious, having just been on the floor and listening to male Republican Senators talk about “fairness” in regard to Dr. Ford and Debbie Ramirez. In what universe is it “fair” that the FBI didn’t speak to a single corroborating witness of their accounts?
Every one of us should be able to agree that it's WRONG to assault women. We shouldn’t normalize horrible behavior as “boys being boys.” So, to every survivor of sexual assault: I see your strength &amp; courage through this difficult time, &amp; I stand resolutely with you in this fight
On every level, Brett Kavanaugh has completely disqualified himself to sit on the highest court in our land. The Senate still has one final chance tomorrow to do the right thing. I am praying that it will.
Let us hope that, a few minutes from now, a majority of the Senate will vote to protect the integrity of the Court.
First, @senatemajldr &amp; the GOP stole a SCOTUS seat from @BarackObama. Now they seek to fill a seat w/ an individual w/ a horrific record of lies and abuse of women, on top of a philosophy that rewrites the Constitution from its "We The People" mission to gov by &amp; for the powerful

I can assure you that such aggressive and dehumanizing behavior should be a disqualifying factor for anyone proposed for to be nominated to a positon of service.
I want all of those women who have called or are  thinking about calling to know: You are being heard. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this nominee.
Their lives were touched by sexual assault or aggression. Take seriously the experience Dr. Ford had, because it is an experience that is not too dissimilar to those experienced by friends, family, neighbors, coworkers in your lives.
The hearing from yesterday has caused many women from across the country to re-experience the trauma and terror of sexual assault and aggression in their past– with hundreds calling my office to share their stories.
Reopening the @FBI investigation is necessary but not sufficient. Committee should call other witnesses. And the Senate still needs Brett Kavanaugh’s full record from his @WhiteHouse years. The Senate should do its constitutional duty, not ram through a hyperpartisan nominee.
The Senate needs to take these claims seriously enough to have a legitimate investigation—one that is probing and thorough, not just a show to check a box.
Additionally, the Senate Judiciary Committee should hear under oath from Mark Judge and other witnesses and accusers. This isn’t about process, it’s about substance.
All three of Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers have called for a reopened FBI investigation, and survivors across this nation are looking to the Senate to see what message we send to them.
Reopening the FBI investigation is a necessary and appropriate step. In fact, it’s the bare minimum we should expect when a Supreme Court candidate is faced with such serious, disturbing, and credible charges.
Resist. PERSIST. And VOTE this November.
The American Bar Association says that the Senate cannot and should not vote until the @FBI investigates the serious and credible sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. America: RISE UP. Speak out! 
https://t.co/Ge8fC710RR
I’m furious that Republicans are running over Dr. Ford and ramming through the confirmation of someone who made plain yesterday that he is not fit for the Supreme Court. It’s an affront to every survivor of sexual assault.  Dr. Ford deserves better. America deserves better. Shame
It’s clear that the Senate Judiciary Republicans set this whole thing up not to find the truth, but to just be able to throw up their hands and say there’s no way to know what happened.
It is a travesty that the committee is planning to move forward without an FBI investigation and without hearing from Mark Judge or other witnesses or other accusers.
Brett Kavanaugh showed himself today to be a partisan hack in a robe, utterly lacking the temperament to be a justice of the Supreme Court. And his repeated refusal to request an FBI investigation speaks volumes.
Thank YOU for making your voices heard! https://t.co/YUvjqIrvBK
Thank you Dr. Ford for coming forward and telling your story. What you did today took tremendous courage and was incredibly powerful.
Dr. Ford has been amazing. She is an inspiration and source of strength to every survivor.
The world is watching the #KavanaughHearings. History will remember this moment. What will you say to your children when they ask what happened? America: YOU have the POWER to create change. It’s called voting. And November is coming.
Dr. Ford deserves to be heard. Here’s her opening statement. You can read it yourself. #KavanaughHearings  https://t.co/QYDoQhzb4t
These hearings are supposed to be Kavanaugh’s job interview, but Republicans are turning it into a kangaroo court show trial of Dr. Ford. Appears that no measure of decency, shame, or justice will interfere with their determination to railroad this nominee through, apparently.
The test is whether the Judiciary R-11-men are treating Dr. Ford with the decency and dignity they would give their mother, wife, sister, or daughter. By treating her as a criminal, they are failing that test.
Message to the Judiciary R-11-men: Dr. Ford is not on trial. It is wrong to hire a prosecutor to cross-examine her as if she is a criminal.
If Dr. Ford is NOT on trial, then why did Senate Republicans hire a prosecutor to cross-examine her on Thursday? This is ridiculous.

Brett Kavanaugh’s pattern of conduct, extreme views, and failure to be fully truthful and forthcoming under oath make him entirely unsuited to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.  For the good of the country and the integrity of the court, he should step aside. https://t.co/bms9PgpccG
I urge @SecPompeo to follow the logical conclusions of his department’s report, and designate these horrific crimes as what they are — ethnic cleansing and genocide.

I call upon Brett Kavanaugh for the good of the country and the integrity of the court to step aside immediately.
The additional information provided by Ms. Ramirez regarding Kavanaugh’s behavior in college presents a pattern of conduct that makes it absolutely clear that he is entirely unsuited to serve on the Supreme Court.

As this framework gets closer to potentially becoming a reality, we need full transparency and a fierce fight to strengthen these provisions that are key to the future of America’s middle class.
However, the most essential component to create a level playing field is to have stronger environmental and labor standards, and—critically—for those standards to actually be enforceable. Right now, the reported enforcement deal in this agreement is insufficient.
Reportedly, this potential deal does include some positive steps, such as a more level playing field for auto manufacturing and an overdue reining-in of unaccountable corporate tribunals.
For more than two decades, American jobs and American workers have suffered because of major imbalances in #NAFTA. Our middle class desperately needs a better deal. However, the devil is in the details.
It was an honor to hear the moving tributes to @SenJohnMcCain and to join his family, friends and colleagues in celebrating his extraordinary life. John was right. “Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America.”

Horrifying and completely unacceptable. Thousands of American lives were lost – and the White House and federal officials simply turned a blind eye. We need to act to make sure this never happens in America again. https://t.co/RM0BAF8hzM
These expected changes are not designed for small, community banks. They are written to re-open the Wall Street casino and let the biggest banks back into the hedge fund gambling business. A backdoor attempt to re-write Wall Street reform—one that is dangerous and unacceptable.
SIREN: Major changes to the Volcker Rule are coming this week, starting tomorrow. This represents the most brazen attack yet on Wall Street reform.
High-quality, affordable #healthcare should be easily available to all Americans.

During Watergate, principled Republicans stood up and saved our country from a constitutional crisis. We need that again in 2018. If you’re worried about protecting the Mueller investigation, it’s time to make your voice heard in Congress NOW—before it’s too late.
The ultimate goal—and the huge danger to our democracy—is for Trump to get Republicans in Congress to help slow or shut down this investigation, and to do so soon, before Mueller can get to the bottom of Trump's own activities.
Now, @realDonaldTrump is bullying the Justice Department into making highly sensitive information about an ongoing investigation available to Congressman Nunes, who has a demonstrated intent and history of abusing information to undermine the investigation.
Trump and shameless allies like Nunes are trying to paint the Mueller investigation as a frivolous, politically-motivated “witch hunt” with no end. But this is a serious investigation that’s already indicted 19 people and delivered 5 guilty pleas.
THREAD: Something very dangerous is happening right now. @realDonaldTrump is trying to make the Mueller investigation into just another partisan political battle, to downplay its significance &amp; keep Americans from uniting against any wrongdoing that might be uncovered.
We face real threats around the world, but I don’t think the American people want an endless, ever-expanding war. We need to take war-making off autopilot and put in place a framework that makes Congress do its job, even if it’s difficult. https://t.co/cqaKfKpizA

Dehumanizing minorities isn’t new:
-Nazis referred to Jews as rats
-Hutus called Tutsis cockroaches in Rwandan genocide
-Enslaved African Americans were compared to apes
-Radical monks called Rohingya animals 

Trump calls immigrants animals. 

Words matter – this is dangerous.
A thorough review of Gina Haspel’s record makes clear: She was not only involved in the torture program, she was a passionate advocate and defender of the program. That is deeply disturbing and makes her profoundly unfit to run the CIA. Disappointed by the Senate's vote today.

That’s nonsensical and it’s dangerous for public safety, which is why I’ve joined with Democratic and Republican Senators alike – including @SenCoryGardner, @PattyMurray, @RonWyden, @LisaMurkowski &amp; more – to push for the SAFE Banking Act.
Right now, the conflict between state and federal laws is creating untenable situations – like legal cannabis businesses that have to operate in all-cash because no banks will serve them.
The people of every state should have the choice to make the same decision Oregonians have by legalizing cannabis, and they shouldn’t have to fear retribution or conflict with the federal government.

We have learned in Afghanistan and Iraq the dangers of launching military actions without clearly articulated objectives and exit strategies. If the President wants to wage war, the American people and Congress need to be part of that decision.

Bashar al-Assad has carried out a brutal campaign of attacks on his own people. The use of chemical weapons is unconscionable and he must be held accountable. But military action is not the only tool we have.

It is shocking and unacceptable that Black women are 3-4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.
I’m proud to support @BlkMamasMatter and join with @SenKamalaHarris to honor this week as Black Maternal Health Week.
As the planet warms, climate-related disasters are becoming the new normal. Over the past five years, Americans experienced at least 10 major disasters a year--double the average number of such events since 1980. #TodaysClimateFact https://t.co/ozNJ8f2mBO

I asked Mike Pompeo point blank if he thinks the President has the power to take our nation to war without congressional authorization and without a direct attack or threat to the United States. He said, 'I do.' https://t.co/TN9qtCvkoN
About to join @ErinBurnett @CNN on why Mike Pompeo is the wrong choice for Secretary of State. Tune in!
A vote for Pompeo is a vote for Trump's war cabinet. I will vehemently oppose his nomination. https://t.co/zxxqps9HMB
Horrifying: “At more than 70 sites across the country, toxins like arsenic, mercury, and radium are leaching into groundwater from pond-like storage pits filled with the sludgy leftovers of coal burning.” #TodaysClimateFact https://t.co/IDtq6Gye3K
“No reason” for a bad relationship?
 
I can think of a few:
1.Hacking/meddling in our election
2.Illegal annexation of Crimea
3.Ukraine occupation
4.Chemical weapon attack in UK
5.Supporting Assad
 
So why does Trump act as a lapdog for Putin, not a watchdog for America? https://t.co/YcVwTnkfej

Trump may deny climate chaos, but that won’t keep our buildings, bridges, and roads standing during floods. That’s why scientists &amp; engineers tell us climate chaos is “one of the most significant threats to the nation’s infrastructure.” https://t.co/eA3CWUHrNe #TodaysClimateFact

Thx to @EPAScottPruitt, we'll be seeing more asthma attacks, higher costs, worse climate chaos. The only way it makes sense to scrap these standards is if you're determined to do the fossil fuel industry’s bidding, no matter the expense to the rest of us. https://t.co/18qd1utwNk

In a dangerous world, we need State Dept. leadership that values diplomacy and our career diplomats. We need to lead a global coalition against extremism and to tackle global threats from terrorism to climate change to nuclear proliferation. Is Pompeo the right man for the job?
Nothing in Pompeo's record indicates he believes in diplomacy as an effective tool. He's acted as a hardline partisan, defended torture &amp; warrantless surveillance, and tried to blow up the deal that has kept Iran from developing nuclear weapons. So this news is deeply concerning.
This is the moment when “House Intelligence” becomes an oxymoron. It completely discredits the investigation by the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee when they claim that Russia didn't favor any particular candidate in the 2016 election. https://t.co/qBkfX9F1Xf

Let's review:
1. Trump manufactures DACA crisis
2. Trump claims he wants a bipartisan deal to solve it 
3. Senators reach bipartisan deal 
4. Trump sabotages the deal, and with it, the futures of 1.8 million Dreamers https://t.co/UCFFoTgh8G

This proposal was a tough compromise. It fails to protect Dreamers’ parents, and it provides a path to begin construction of a wall that stops neither people nor drugs. But this proposal also represented the best chance to protect Dreamers, and we need to do right by them.
Today's events show starkly that @realDonaldTrump's promise to "take the heat" for a #DACA deal was a lie. Presented with a true, bipartisan compromise to solve this issue, President Trump didn’t take the heat to sell it – he took a knife to kill it. https://t.co/mCTiads91x

If @RealDonaldTrump had nothing to hide, would he be up at night plotting to see how he could control this investigation?

I’ll be joining @CNN @NewDay shortly. Hope you can tune in!
!!!! The fact that @realDonaldTrump tried to fire Mueller is a red flag as big as they come.

Trump &amp; GOP leaders should've never brought us to the #TrumpShutdown in the 1st place. We must keep holding their feet to the fire on bipartisan priorities—opioid crisis, #DACA, health centers &amp; more. Voted NO because a lengthy CR doesn’t create the pressure to get the deal done.
Talking with @CNN’s @AnaCabrera about the #TrumpShutdown. Dems want to keep the government open while we negotiate. R’s keep saying no. https://t.co/7uueGbyiDb
Senate Republicans keep objecting to a short-term CR to open the government while we negotiate. Why do they want the government closed? #TrumpShutdown
Trump/GOP track record:

-let CHIP expire
-ended DACA, jeopardizing future for 800k dreamers
-neglected opioid crisis
-delayed disaster relief for hurricanes, fires
-rejected bipartisan deals
-shut down gov’t

They need to do their jobs now, not 3 weeks from now. #TrumpShutdown

Mitch McConnell’s got a choice to make. Is he going to take the bipartisan deal or shut down the government? It’s not complicated and shouldn’t be a tough choice.
#DREAMers are important members of our communities and we must protect their futures. The President and Republicans in Congress are treating their status as a political football – totally unfair and wrong. I won’t be a party to any deal that continues to kick #DACA down the road.

It’s been 108 days since the GOP let #CHIP expire. Every day, the families of 9 million children live in limbo as Congress continues to kick the can down the road on children’s health care. That’s unacceptable. We need a long-term solution for these 9 million children.
Even with control over both chambers and every branch of government, the GOP is STILL struggling to get to a deal to fund the government. Their failure to govern is a major threat to the American people.

It is utterly baffling that Trump and the GOP might shut down the government to force taxpayers to pay for a wall that won’t work and most Americans don’t want. Remember when Trump promised over and over that Mexico was going to pay?
Stable funding for #CHIP is not only the right thing to do for 9 million children who rely on this critical program – it would SAVE the govt $$! Yet it’s been 103 days since GOP let it expire. What are we waiting for? Children's health care is on the line. https://t.co/vcUZcFAFrp

It’s egregiously irresponsible for Trump to open the Arctic to drilling. The Arctic is much too fragile to withstand the type of spill that would be inevitable if drilling proceeds. We must put the Arctic completely and permanently off limits to drilling to prevent catastrophe.
Offshore drilling threatens the way of life for countless communities along the Atlantic &amp; Pacific coasts, including in Oregon. These communities don’t want offshore drilling that'll diminish tourism, harm commercial fishing operations, &amp; burden them w/ the risk of an oil spill.
Expanding offshore drilling at a time when we're already dealing with the devastating impacts of climate disruption is the height of irresponsibility.

Trump just signed #GOPTaxScam. You pay more, so the ultra-rich and powerful corporations pay less:

- Taxes go up for 86 mil middle-class families by 2027
- Health care premiums rise
- 13 mil lose health care

… but don’t worry, the rich and powerful get trillions in tax breaks!

-giving 83% of benefits to the richest 1%
-encouraging sending jobs overseas
-increasing our national debt
-destroying health care for 13mil &amp; raising the cost of health insurance for millions more
Unbelievable.

One of the hidden ways the #GOPTaxScam is taking it to middle-class Americans: child tax credit and SALT deduction aren’t adjusted for inflation. Every year they’re worth less.  But – surprise! – the amount of the Trump kids’ exemption from the dynasty tax goes up every year.
Our big economic problem is NOT that the rich are struggling to get by. Working families need better jobs, education &amp; health care to thrive. Instead, by 2027 #GOPTaxScam gives the wealthiest 0.1% of families on avg more in tax cuts than most families in my community earn in a yr https://t.co/gQkvsQVByg

#GOPTaxScam is also a health care destruction bill. Repealing a key pillar of the ACA will wreak havoc on our health care system, drive up premiums &amp; leave millions w/o insurance. This is, of course, the point. Rs are determined to destroy the ACA at any cost. We need your help.

➡️#RenewCHIP to save health care for 9mil children
➡️Fund Community Health Centers
➡️Protect 800,000 #DREAMERs
➡️Pass disaster relief 
 
What GOP is focusing on instead:
➡️Enriching the rich &amp; powerful 
 
Completely backwards &amp; wrong.
This piece by my colleagues @SenWarren &amp; @SenSanders hits the nail on the head. We should be taking care of #CHIP, #DREAMers &amp; other priorities that’ll actually deliver for working America – not enriching the already rich &amp; powerful with this #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/ja1kY2k5Yr
The GOP promised taxpayers could file their taxes simply on a single piece of paper. Promise broken. 
 
This bill makes taxes more complex and invites gaming by the wealthy so they pay less and working Americans pay more.  #GOPTaxScam

.@HouseGOP just voted to move forward on:
-raising taxes on millions of working Americans
-ripping health care away from 13mil
-making student loans more expensive
...all to shower massive giveaways on the richest 1% &amp; powerful corporations.
Unbelievable. Stop the bank heist!

Remember: the fight to defeat #GOPTaxScam is NOT over yet. House &amp; Senate will now be hashing out the differences of the disgraceful Senate &amp; the wretched House bills. Make your voice heard &amp; flood the phone lines. Let's stop this bill before it reaches @RealDonaldTrump’s desk!
@OreBusinessPlan @RonWyden I spoke about the need for funding to help prevent future devastating wildfires in the next disaster bill. In Oregon, we have almost 2 million acres of work that’ve already been approved for fuels reduction and forest thinning projects. Let’s hurry up and get it funded!
At @OreBusinessPlan’s #OLSummit with @RonWyden to discuss how we can help Oregon small businesses and middle-class families thrive through investments in priorities working Oregonians actually need – like infrastructure and education – not more tax cuts for the richest Americans. https://t.co/DdDxNSEAoJ

DeVos Tax Earmark is exactly the type of handout for the wealthy and well-connected that makes this bill so awful. Glad my amendment to strike it passed. Too bad the rest of the bill is full of more of the same. https://t.co/vGcj2FZE5P
This is not over yet: The House will still need to act on the Senate bill. It's up to every American who believes in the "We the People" vision of our democracy to stop this bill before it gets to the President's desk.
Here’s what the GOP just voted for:
- Raising taxes on millions of working Americans
- Ripping health care away from 13 million
- Showering massive giveaways on the richest and most powerful

#GOPTaxScam is a disgrace.
Let’s be clear: what just happened is a brazen move to rig our political system and our economy to work not for “We the People,” but for “We the Powerful.” If the #GOPTaxScam is allowed to become law, it will haunt America for decades to come.
This is a sad day for America.
When we shined a spotlight on the terrible DeVos Tax Earmark, a few in the GOP were embarrassed enough to take it out, which is exactly why GOP is rushing a handwritten bill through in the middle of the night. There’s plenty in there just as bad or worse that might now become law
Senate just passed my amendment to strike the terrible DeVos Tax Earmark – a handout for a wealthy, DeVos-funded private school that refuses to comply with federal non-discrimination laws. Like all these special interest giveaways, it never should have been in this #TaxScamBill.
HAPPENING NOW: Voting on my amdt to strike the DeVos Tax Earmark – a provision that provides a tax exemption for Hillsdale College, a DeVos-funded elite private school that refuses to comply with federal non-discrimination laws. These special interest giveaways are outrageous!!!
479 pages full of massive giveaways for the privileged and powerful at the expense of working America.  

One giant #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/BS8KBPIzNS
#GOPTaxScam is riddled with special interest provisions, but one of the most outrageous is the Hillsdale Handout – a tax exemption for a college that refuses to comply with nondiscrimination law. Make your voice heard against this egregious tax scheme. https://t.co/lWFZsMlCqZ
I'm right outside of the Senate Chamber, calling out special interest giveaways in the GOP tax plan LIVE: https://t.co/TPaW0m4wPh
Disgusting indeed. What is this list and why haven’t we nor the American people seen it?! This is NOT the way to do business in the Senate. The GOP is working for the swamp, NOT for the people. https://t.co/oNzTs35Ffo
UPDATE: Apparently, I’m voting on #GOPTaxScam today or tomorrow, but I haven't seen the bill. My @SenateGOP colleagues are rushing behind closed doors to make significant changes that will affect each and every one of you. This is an affront to our “We the People” democracy!
These tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations won’t pay for themselves. #GOPTaxScam would cut into critical funds for farmers. @RealDonaldTrump and the GOP have completely misplaced priorities. https://t.co/ptKu3mDtiy
If GOP insists on trillion-dollar tax cuts, it should go to the middle class! It’s not complicated: I have an amendment that would replace their cuts for the rich and big corporations with $3k a year for every family earning under $100k.
#GOPTaxScam is an attack on the clean, renewable energy economy of the future – including wind energy that is critical to red states like North Dakota, Iowa and Texas. #TodaysClimateFact

America needs a watchdog to defend our democracy, not a lapdog for Putin. https://t.co/3rL9feJNo1

This week, Trump has actively defended those who represent worst forms of hate. This conduct is beyond unacceptable, and must be condemned.
An American President must stand firmly against any form of white supremacy - not stand up for those marching w/neo-Nazis, KKK, etc.
Congress should censure Trump for supporting hate and encouraging white supremacists who traffic in violence.

There's never been a bill more deserving of being defeated — the process was an embarrassment to the Senate, and the substance was awful.

I’ll be there! https://t.co/jrmc6bRB6X
Not many working families can afford an additional $1,200 per year in health costs. But that's what #SkinnyRepeal could mean on average.
What #SkinnyRepeal really means: 16 million lose care, destroying their peace of mind that if they get sick, they can get care they need.
The best way to derail a horrific bill isn't to delay it, it's to defeat it! https://t.co/dIcTF8dAiY
@SenateGOP This #healthcare vote will make history. Let’s make it a history that we can all be proud of.
It’s clear that @SenateGOP has been hiding this bill all along because they're ashamed of it —  and they should be!
HAPPENING NOW: On the floor to speak out against the GOP’s shameful #healthcare plan. Watch LIVE: https://t.co/EnKMbD4lTE
Bravo @JerryBrownGov! Thrilled about this bold move to #ActOnClimate. #TodaysClimateFact https://t.co/jtIntegPT5
Now, we need civilian leadership, starting in the WH, to reverse this decision &amp; continue treating all personnel with respect—now and always
Thank you to military leadership for reminding us that here in America, we govern by rule of law, not rule of tweet. https://t.co/hqGNZxYnAL
@realDonaldTrump Let’s be 100% clear: Trump, Pence &amp; Sessions are advocating for Americans to be fired from their jobs b/c of who they are &amp; whom they love.
.@RealDonaldTrump said he’d “protect our #LGBTQ citizens” in his campaign. Now he’s actively encouraging discrimination against them.
Disgraceful. When will the Trump Admin’s shameful attacks on our #LGBTQ friends and neighbors end? Trump must reverse course immediately. https://t.co/vWxUWH5SFe

Good morning! I'm up bright and early joining @npr @morningedition at 6am to discuss #healthcare. Hope you can tune in if you are up too!
I repeat: this is not a drill. According to @USCBO estimates, even GOP’s “skinny” repeal would kick 16 million off their health care by 2024 https://t.co/MyHFPmCKYJ

Health debate so far: 
Repeal and replace? Dead.  
Repeal only? Dead.  
“Skinny” repeal vote still to come. 
 
America, you know what to do!
@SenateGOP Here are some of the 100+ amendments I’m introducing in this #healthcare debate today. It’s time to improve, not destroy our #healthcare. https://t.co/bdJDRVmQfi
I'm introducing over 100 amendments. @SenateGOP needs to reckon with damage their plans would inflict on millions. https://t.co/H5IvVMZL08
Under skinny repeal, your premiums could rise $1.2k just NEXT YR. GOP plan= bad for our health &amp; bad for our wallets https://t.co/YlJpfm19DT
In February, @Scaramucci argued Trump was most pro-LGBTQ president in history. If anyone bought that sales pitch then, they won’t buy it now https://t.co/ofX6h2td6c
GOP’s idea of a “skinny repeal” still rips away care from 15mil Americans. Sounds more like a big fat attack on America's #healthcare to me. https://t.co/giuu3BKJbn

.@SenateDems and I took our debate outside so the people can participate. We demand a fair and open process. https://t.co/PntuV4noOf
GOP ramming this vote through without telling us what’s in the bill is a complete and total violation of any reasonable legislative process. https://t.co/NffyL85M2l
Join me on the Capitol steps to fight to #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/E1Y33z5FVc
The longer we contemplate destroying #healthcare for millions of Americans, the higher a price American people will have to pay— literally.
GOP’s reckless health care strategy is already destabilizing #healthcare markets and forcing premiums to rise.
No one knows what'll be in the final bill, but every plan to date would rip away care from over 20 million — unacceptable and indefensible.
🚨This is not a drill. GOP just voted to move forward. Now’s the time to turn up the heat. We need your voices more than ever. Don’t let up! https://t.co/qtZswbfJzL
No question — this vote is about Rs striving to rip #healthcare away from more than 20mil Americans!!
.@realDonaldTrump is clearly terrified of Mueller's findings, which means it must go forward!
Trump's attacks on Sessions look like preparation to get a new AG to stop Mueller's probe.

.@SenateGOP: Quit playing political games with people's lives. Cease &amp; desist on your plans to destroy life-saving #healthcare for millions.
We're not just talking about ripping away #healthcare, but ripping away peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they can get care.
This is like dismantling the plane you're flying in &amp; THEN asking what tools &amp; parts you have to rebuild it with. Wrong order of operations!
I know GOP feels desperate to vote, but altering 1/6 of economy on the fly with no deliberation is massively and destructively irresponsible

The American people, my fellow Senators and I deserve to know about and weigh in on this #healthcare bill before voting!

Weak enforcement by the Trump Administration would mean 2.8-5.1% higher premiums.

… And 3/4 of the population by 2026. The non-partisan @USCBO is sounding the alarm: the GOP’s repeal-only plan would be an absolute disaster https://t.co/L1w5eBQrHm
GOP repeal-only bill would cause premiums to skyrocket right away– 25% in 1st yr! That's on top of premium increases that'd otherwise happen
Trump/McConnell #RepealAndRun plan kicks 18 mil off #healthcare in 1 year, 32 mil by 2026. Premiums go up by 25% now, 100% in 10 years.

GOP bill would leave 22 mil Americans (including 400k Oregonians on OHP) out in the cold. Joining @RonWyden in Eugene to #ProtectOurCare! https://t.co/Cv4lQRd36u
