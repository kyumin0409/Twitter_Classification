The Affordable Care Act allows #Medicare patients to get preventive services like cancer screenings and annual physicals without a co-pay.

Under the Affordable Care Act, you can't be denied insurance or charged more just because of your medical history.

It has expanded coverage and driven down #healthcare costs. #ACA
Because of important changes included in the Affordable Care Act, Washington seniors covered by #Medicare have saved an average of $978.

We must #ProtectOurCare.
We‚Äôre not doing a good enough job tracking the distribution of #opioids. Legislation I wrote was signed into law last week and introduces stiffer fines &amp; penalties for those who don‚Äôt do their job in tracking the distribution of these drugs.
In Washington state, more than 600,000 people have received #healthcare through #Medicaid Expansion. In states like ours that have expanded Medicaid, individual market premiums have been 7% lower than in states that have not.
The Affordable Care Act preserves every cent of Medicare-guaranteed benefits and makes improvements to the program. The #ACA included improvements and delivery system reforms that are strengthening and improving #Medicare.
The individual health insurance market is an important source of coverage for Washingtonians. But since President Trump took office, Washington state‚Äôs individual health insurance market has seen a 50% hike in approved premium increases. #ProtectOurCare

The Affordable Care Act‚Äôs pre-existing condition protections are under threat by a federal lawsuit, supported by the Trump administration, that could be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Patients should not be denied access to #healthcare because of a pre-existing condition.
From 2016 to 2017, the uninsured rate in Washington state went up by 1.5% following President Trump's deliberate sabotage of the #healthcare system.

The fines for not tracking excessive opioid distribution have been too small, but penalties signed into law last week increase the chances that #opioid manufacturers will think twice about the severe penalties of continuing to thwart the law.
Large quantities of #opioids have flooded our communities because of excessive shipments from manufacturers. In our state, a physician in Everett wrote more than 10,000 prescriptions of opioids‚Äî26 times higher than the average prescriber in Everett.
Americans want more affordable #healthcare with meaningful coverage‚Äînot junk plans that don‚Äôt protect us.

The Trump administration is pushing yet another plan to expand junk insurance that doesn‚Äôt cover basics &amp; hurts people with pre-existing conditions.

https://t.co/Rqdpq7sk6V
Make no mistake: If the provision of the #ACA that protects Americans with pre-existing conditions is struck down, it would lead to more chaos. Millions of people would be at risk of discrimination or denial of #healthcare coverage.

In Washington state, more than 600,000 people have received #healthcare through #Medicaid Expansion.

In states like ours that have expanded Medicaid, individual market premiums have been 7% lower than in states that have not.
The individual health insurance market is an important source of coverage for Washingtonians. But since President Trump took office, Washington state‚Äôs individual health insurance market has seen a 50% hike in approved premium increases. #ProtectOurCare
Legislation signed into law this week includes provisions from my Comprehensive Addiction Reform, Education, and Safety Act to increase penalties on #opioid manufacturers who fail to take reasonable steps to prevent their drugs from entering the black market.
From 2016 to 2017, the uninsured rate in Washington state went up by 1.5% following President Trump's deliberate sabotage of the #healthcare system.

We want patients in Washington state to be protected. Denying people insurance is a bad idea.
The Affordable Care Act‚Äôs pre-existing condition protections are under threat by a federal lawsuit, supported by the Trump administration, that could be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Patients should not be denied access to #healthcare because of a pre-existing condition.
People should not be discriminated against because of their medical history. We must defend the provision of the Affordable Care Act that protects coverage for pre-existing conditions. #ACA
Last month I met with law enforcement leaders, including @AGOWA Ferguson, @KingCountyWA Undersheriff Somers, @PierceSheriff Pastor &amp; @SnoCoSheriff Trenary, to discuss #bipartisan legislation to fight back against the #opioid epidemic.

Today that bill was signed into law. https://t.co/8ja6xtd6LV
As I‚Äôve traveled through the state of Washington, law enforcement officers &amp; local communities have told me we need new tools to fight the #opioid epidemic. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve worked with people across our state to try to provide the solutions our law enforcement &amp; communities want.
The Trump administration is pushing yet another plan to expand junk insurance that doesn‚Äôt cover basics &amp; hurts people with pre-existing conditions.

Americans want more affordable #healthcare with meaningful coverage‚Äînot junk plans that don‚Äôt protect us.

Regional airports are a critical economic driver for communities throughout Washington state.

From Walla Walla to Bellingham, ensuring these communities have thriving airports helps grow small businesses and create new jobs.

Access to #healthcare through the #Medicaid expansion was big in Washington state, especially among rural communities.

Thanks to the expansion, counties like Douglas and Chelan have seen their uninsured rates drop by more than 60%.

https://t.co/Xz4Dxevfxx
My #FAAreauthorization legislation, which the U.S. Senate passed earlier this month, reforms the #FAA‚Äôs Contract Tower Cost Share Program.

This will save the @PortWallaWalla roughly $100,000 per year.

For the families, people with disabilities, seniors, children, and veterans who use Medicaid for #healthcare, we cannot allow the war on Medicaid to continue.

#Medicaid is a key part of our health care delivery system.

This month, the Senate passed #bipartisan legislation I helped author to fully fund contract air traffic control towers, which will help Walla Walla Regional Airport pay for its air traffic control tower under contract with the #FAA.

https://t.co/WZs02I5EwQ
A new report from @USGAO found that ‚Äúlow-income people in states that haven‚Äôt expanded Medicaid are much more likely to forgo needed medical care than those in other states.‚Äù

The #Medicaid expansion has helped thousands of people in Washington state.

More than 650,000 people in Washington state have gained coverage through the expansion of #Medicaid coverage.

Medicaid is a key part of our #healthcare delivery system, and we should continue moving toward ways to innovate in Medicaid and save costs.

https://t.co/Xz4Dxevfxx
NEW STUDY: "Nearly 20% of low-income people in states that did not expand #Medicaid said they passed up needed medical care in the past 12 months because they couldn‚Äôt afford it."

Dr. Ford showed great strength and courage in painting for the nation the long-lasting impacts of sexual assault.
The Senate should not move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination. Dr. Ford's strong testimony should be enough to stop any further votes before a complete nonpartisan investigation takes place.
The U.S. Senate should move in a serious but deliberate and cautious path tomorrow. It should not spend time prosecuting a woman, but rather listening to the facts and information that she gives.
My Republican colleagues don't think they're doing damage, they think they're sticking up for a nominee. But the desire today has to be that we don't make the same mistakes as other institutions. We must pay attention to these allegations and we must take them seriously.

In Seattle, I was with @PattyMurray, @PPVNH, and @ProChoiceWA to say that we should not rush Brett Kavanaugh's nomination process before we have all the facts. We need to get this right. https://t.co/D6fhx6qBut
With the passage of this legislation in the U.S. Senate, we are one step closer to giving law enforcement the tools they need to help us fight the #opioidcrisis.

We want to make sure that those with chronic pain are getting the help they need. But we also want to have tools in the community to prevent the illicit distribution or over-prescribing of these drugs. #opioidcrisis

We need to do something now to make sure that opioid manufacturers follow the laws that are already on the books. This legislation takes a major step forward by including strong penalties for negligent opioid distribution.

https://t.co/Cw7dLOYrNp
We must treat Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegation against Judge Kavanaugh seriously. We need a nonpartisan investigation into the facts, which could help the Judiciary Committee understand exactly what transpired. We should not rush this process and hurry to a vote. We need to get this right.
In Seattle, I joined @AGOWA Ferguson, health officials, and local law enforcement leaders to discuss the importance of major bipartisan legislation passed¬†in the Senate to combat the ongoing #opioid and heroin epidemic.

https://t.co/E5UaVVNw3X
I have previously announced that I do not support Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, but we're now discussing a larger issue. We need a nonpartisan investigation into the facts and information of Dr. Ford's allegation.
Current fines for failing to follow the federal law just aren‚Äôt enough. That's why there's a provision in this legislation to increase civil penalties for #opioid manufacturers who fail to follow the law by 10 times, from $10,000 to $100,000 per violation.
With the passage of this legislation in the U.S. Senate, we are one step closer to giving law enforcement the tools they need to help us fight the #opioidcrisis.

Today, too many middle-class families across our country are struggling to make ends meet. Too many people work long hours for too little pay. As the Senate continues its business this fall, I will continue to fight on the side of working families.
In Washington state, we know the power of labor first-hand. Our state continues to lead the nation in fostering innovation and supporting entrepreneurs &amp; small businesses. We have the best workers in the world, who consistently prevail even when the deck is stacked against them.
Today, as we do each Labor Day, we honor &amp; reflect on the hard-working men &amp; women who‚Äôve built our country into a land of opportunity, freedom &amp; prosperity. Throughout our history, the labor movement has served as the backbone of the economy &amp; the guardian of the American Dream.
The @WSJ editorial board joined me in defending Washington‚Äôs cherry growers against President Trump‚Äôs misguided trade war. This year, Washington state cherry growers are estimating up to $86 million in damages from the trade war.

People should not be discriminated against because of their medical history. We must defend the provision of the #ACA that protects coverage for pre-existing conditions.
I've requested a thorough analysis of what steps the Trump administration is taking to combat Russian #cyber warfare capabilities &amp; intrusions into our energy facilities. I'm concerned about Russia‚Äôs capabilities with respect to #cyberattacks on our energy infrastructure.
For the last half century, the #LWCF has protected lands, historic sites, national parks &amp; wilderness areas in every state. It is one of the country‚Äôs best conservation programs, preserving public lands &amp; ensuring access to outdoor recreation in rural &amp; urban areas. #SaveLWCF
We in Washington state have witnessed firsthand the disaster of #wildfires and what the aftermath means for people living in affected communities. Our heroic #firefighters do everything they can to be ready for the fire season, and we need to do the same.
Almost half of Washington state renters are cost burdened, spending over 30% of their income on rent. There are only 29 affordable &amp; available homes for every 100 extremely low income families. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the #affordablehousing crisis.
If protections for pre-existing conditions are rolled back, more than 3 million Washingtonians could be at risk. That means 3 million Washingtonians could not have #health insurance either because it‚Äôs too costly or because they‚Äôre denied coverage.
Deterring foreign enemies from attacking our #election systems and other critical infrastructure is just the first step we must take to protect our national security and democratic institutions. #DETERact https://t.co/lB48nJ2nhg

There are 2.5 million outboard motors on the water today that could be replaced by an electric motor. We have a chance here in Washington state to pioneer a whole new industry. Electric motors can bring down fuel costs, lower carbon footprints, and reduce our dependence on oil.

For the economy, sportsmen, veterans, wildlife, and our kids &amp; grandkids, we must permanently reauthorize #LWCF. In Washington state alone, the outdoor recreation economy contributes over $26 billion in consumer spending and supports more than 201,000 direct jobs. #SaveLWCF
I worked with @PattyMurray on an amendment to help bridge the digital divide and provide for universal access to high-speed Internet, so every American can receive equal educational, business and employment opportunities, no matter where they live in Washington state.

Broadband is a necessity. Without it, kids didn‚Äôt have high-speed internet to do their homework and entrepreneurs were unable to start online businesses or even develop a basic web presence. Everyone should have universal access to high-speed internet, no matter where they live.
By creating a simple, voluntary #cybersecurity framework for small businesses, legislation I've introduced will help small businesses protect their data, while focusing on what they do best: serving their customers and creating jobs. #smallbiz
These federal lands support billions of dollars each year in revenues from outdoor recreation, provide opportunities for hunting &amp; fishing, protect critical habitat for threatened &amp; endangered species &amp; supply clean drinking water to millions of Americans.

The #LWCF is one of the country‚Äôs best conservation programs, preserving public lands &amp; ensuring access to outdoor recreation in rural &amp; urban areas. For the last half century, it has protected lands, historic sites, national parks, wilderness areas &amp; urban parks in every state.
I'm pleased to report that an amendment I worked on with @PattyMurray to ensure rural communities across Washington state are eligible to compete for #broadband service grants passed in the Senate this week. Broadband is a necessity.

The Trump administration‚Äôs proposed Title X rule would make it harder for Washington women to get basic health care. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining my colleagues to call on the administration to rescind it. #TitleX #NoGagRule
Foreign provocation no longer just comes in the form of a foreign submarine sticking its nose in U.S. waters or a plane flying overhead‚Äîit now also comes as hacking of a power plant or pipeline. We should be leading the charge internationally to protect critical infrastructure.
#TitleX is the only federal grant program solely dedicated to family planning &amp; related preventive services. I oppose the Trump administration‚Äôs latest attack on Title X. https://t.co/Etz5gE4yTq
The United States should be leading the charge internationally to say that trying to influence the election process in a cyber way is a cyber crime. No government should be involved in interfering with the actual election operations. End of story.

Nearly two-thirds of #TitleX patients have incomes at or below the federal poverty level, and 43% of patients are uninsured. In 2016, nearly 4,000 Title X-funded health centers provided 720,000 Pap tests, nearly 1 million women with breast exams, and 1.2 million HIV tests.

Denying #healthcare to those with pre-existing conditions actually costs everyone more in the end. Emergency rooms would be flooded with people waiting to get care, and those costs would be astronomical. Health care rates for all of us could increase.
Allowing child welfare agencies to close the door to qualified foster &amp; adoptive parents due to a difference in religious belief opens the door to taxpayer-funded discrimination. We should protect the rights of all qualified parents who answer the call to foster &amp; adopt children.

In the GOP tax law, oil companies got a $4 billion dollar tax break (on top of a lower corporate tax rate). And yet here we are, months later, paying higher gas prices. What did Washingtonians get out of those tax breaks? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair use of taxpayer money.
Aside from the fact that we‚Äôre continuing to put unsustainable levels of carbon into the atmosphere, America‚Äôs increase in #fossilfuel production seems only to be padding the bloated oil economy profits rather than helping the household budgets of many consumers.
Record-level oil production here in the U.S. isn‚Äôt providing relief at the #gas pump, despite the fact that just last week we reached a new production record of 11 million barrels per day. It's very hard for us to drill our way out of this problem.
Because #gasoline prices are up, the average Washington household will pay $149 more in fuel costs this summer. We don‚Äôt want to see the price of oil get any more expensive.

Almost half of Washington state renters are cost burdened, spending over 30% of their income on rent. There are only 29 affordable &amp; available homes for every 100 extremely low income families. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the #affordablehousing crisis.
I‚Äôm glad that the @Interior Department is being very aggressive about using #drones on wildland fires. This new tool is so critical for information about fire size, starts, safety, and the security of our #firefighters.
The #affordablehousing crisis is very real in Washington state. Since 2010, median rents have risen by 19.7% ‚Äì almost 7% higher than those nationwide. I'm prioritizing #affordablehousing in my work in the Senate because so much more needs to be done.
Selling off @bonnevillepower wires and abandoning cost-based rates would raise electricity rates and throttle the Northwest economy. Some of what President Trump &amp; his administration have proposed is downright dangerous.
There is currently a nationwide shortage of 7,200,000 affordable rental homes in the United States, according to @NLIHC. I've introduced legislation that seeks to better understand &amp; respond to America‚Äôs housing crisis by creating a bipartisan #affordablehousing task force.
Deterring foreign enemies from attacking our #election systems and other critical infrastructure is just the first step we must take to protect our national security and democratic institutions. #DETERact
Over the next decade, more than 1,000,000 #affordablehousing properties will exit the market. Increased demand &amp; shrinking supply has resulted in a significant deficit of affordable housing. We have to do better.
President Trump's proposal to sell off transmissions from @bonnevillepower would hit middle class families in the pocketbook &amp; hinder small business growth across the Northwest.
From 2005-2015, more than 9,000,000 new renters joined the market‚Äîthe largest increase on record‚Äîbut #affordablehousing options continue to dwindle. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the affordable housing crisis.
The conclusion of American intelligence agencies is crystal clear: Russian interference in our elections is a fact. We must take immediate action to protect and secure our elections from future meddling by Russia or anyone else. #DETERact
It‚Äôs great to be in @CityofTukwila today to help open one of the largest #affordablehousing complexes for seniors in Washington state. As rents continue to skyrocket, we have to keep up our efforts to address the affordable housing crisis. https://t.co/ek8I2lw2t5
The #affordablehousing task force I'm seeking to create with a #bipartisan group of colleagues will provide recommendations to Congress about how to increase affordable housing options to improve the effectiveness of other federal programs, ranging from education to #healthcare.
When it comes to #wildfires, we just can‚Äôt work fast enough. The changing #climate and environment is making fire more challenging for our @ForestService, for our wildland firefighters, and for our communities. We need to do so much more.
Research shows that an inability to access safe &amp; affordable homes leaves families with fewer üíµ to spend on #healthcare, groceries &amp; other expenses‚Äîfurther trapping them in the cycle of #poverty. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the #affordablehousing crisis.
Some of what President Trump &amp; his administration have proposed is downright dangerous. At the top of the list is the idea to sell off transmissions from @bonnevillepower.
Research shows that an inability to access safe &amp; affordable homes jeopardizes educational performance &amp; economic mobility. We need to better understand &amp; respond to America's #housing crisis.
My bipartisan #election security legislation uses the threat of powerful sanctions to dissuade hostile foreign powers from meddling in our elections. It ensures they know well in advance that the costs will outweigh the benefits. #DETERact
For millions of Americans, a lack of #affordablehousing has profound, negative, and lasting consequences. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the affordable housing crisis and show that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is cost-effective &amp; creates jobs. #LIHTC
This year we were able to boost the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which has built 90% of #affordablehousing in our country. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the affordable housing crisis and show that #LIHTC is cost-effective &amp; creates jobs.

The Trump Administration proposed rolling back a rule that set minimum standards for the oil &amp; gas industry to meet when conducting drilling operations. This endangers oil workers, threatens the environment &amp; imposes enormous potential liability on taxpayers by ignoring safety.
The individual health insurance market is an important source of coverage for more than 260,000 Washingtonians. With President Trump‚Äôs #healthcare sabotage, we are seeing average rate increases in our state's individual market go up again.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed rule rollback would erode key safety and #environmental protections, which I fear would put our $150 billion dollar American coastal economy at great risk to oil spills. #ProtectOurCoast
Local governments in rural communities throughout Washington depend on #PILT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) money to fund critical services &amp; strengthen the community.

We're fighting for the inclusion of people, not prejudice against those with pre-existing conditions. Someone's medical history should not be used to discriminate against them.
If people don‚Äôt have #healthcare insurance or can‚Äôt pay for it, they don‚Äôt just disappear. They end up needing emergency care at a very high cost. We can't go backwards, as President Trump wants, by striking down protections for pre-existing conditions. We must go forward.
When primary care is successfully managed, costs on the entire #healthcare system are reduced.
Make no mistake: If the provision of the #ACA that protects Americans with pre-existing conditions is struck down, it would lead to more chaos. Millions of people would be at risk of discrimination or denial of #healthcare coverage.

The American people deserve a Senate hearing on one of the most pressing issues facing our country. @SenJudiciary has a duty to conduct proper oversight of how the Trump Administration is going to fix the crisis it created &amp; reunify separated children with their parents.
In Clark County, 188,400 people under 65 have a pre-existing condition. If President Trump gets his way, they too could be faced with the unfortunate situation of having an insurer discriminate against them‚Äîdenying them access to #healthcare or making it more expensive.
Denying #healthcare to those with pre-existing conditions actually costs everyone more in the end. Emergency rooms would be flooded with people waiting to get care, and those costs would be astronomical. Health care rates for all of us could increase.
This week, @HHSGov missed a court-imposed deadline to reunite children under age 5 with their parents. I‚Äôve again urged @ChuckGrassley to hold an oversight hearing on the administration's process of reuniting these separated children with their parents.

I'm anxious to hear what President Trump's #SupremeCourt nominee has to say. Is the president able to pardon himself? Do you believe in the emoluments clause? What do you think of the Mueller investigation? These are monumental questions. #WhatsAtStake

Last week in Spokane, I met Jake, a high school student with Type 1 diabetes. He told me that pre-existing conditions like his don't care who you are or if you can afford coverage‚Äîyou either have one or you don‚Äôt. Why should he be treated differently by an insurer? https://t.co/pxDxP7ARqj
President Trump should pick someone who will uphold years of precedent on the U.S. Supreme Court. One great thing about our nation is the independent judiciary.
We're going to do everything we can to defend protections for pre-existing conditions. We're going to stand by the #healthcare community in Spokane and across our state.

This #SupremeCourt discussion is critical for a whole host of issues, including women's right to choose, access to #healthcare, and whether suddenly a pre-existing condition is no longer covered and you have to pay more for health insurance. #WhatsAtStake
When primary care is successfully managed, costs on the entire #healthcare system are reduced.
FACT: Under the Affordable Care Act, you can't be denied insurance or charged more just because of your medical history. It has expanded coverage and driven down #healthcare costs. #ACA
In Clark County, 188,400 people under 65 have a pre-existing condition. If President Trump gets his way, they too could be faced with the unfortunate situation of having an insurer discriminate against them‚Äîdenying them access to #healthcare or making it more expensive.
If people don‚Äôt have insurance, or can‚Äôt pay for it, their demand for #healthcare doesn‚Äôt just go away. Chances are it‚Äôs absorbed by the rest of the community and becomes more expensive.

If protections for pre-existing conditions are rolled back, more than 3 million Washingtonians could be at risk. That means 3 million Washingtonians could be denied coverage or not have #health insurance because it‚Äôs too costly.
If anybody thinks that denying people #health insurance is going to be more cost effective, they‚Äôre wrong. We already know that covering more people on the Medicaid expansion and covering pre-existing conditions is driving down costs.

We need to defend the provision of the #ACA that protects coverage for pre-existing conditions. It should continue to be the law of the land. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sending another letter to President Trump, asking him to protect coverage of pre-existing conditions.
Many different groups are asking to defend coverage for pre-existing conditions. @AmerMedicalAssn, @AmerAcadPeds, @AmericanCancer, @AmDiabetesAssn, @American_Heart, @ahahospitals, and @AAMCtoday are all speaking loudly &amp; clearly because they know exactly what we‚Äôre fighting for.
I sent a letter to President Trump, asking him to tell @TheJusticeDept we need to fight to cover pre-existing conditions, not stand on the sidelines or allow other attorneys general to fight against them.
We want patients in Washington state to be protected. America‚Äôs patients, hospitals, doctors, and nurses are all weighing in: Denying people insurance is a bad idea.
If protections for pre-existing conditions are rolled back, more than 3 million Washingtonians could be at risk. That means 3 million Washingtonians could either not have #health insurance because it‚Äôs too costly or just be denied coverage.
On June 7th, the Trump Administration‚Äôs @TheJusticeDept refused to defend the Affordable Care Act's pre-existing conditions provision in court. Even though these protections are the law of the land and should be enforced &amp; upheld by any administration, they aren‚Äôt doing that.
President Trump and his team are basically saying they want to undo the very protections that allow patients get access to #healthcare even if they have a pre-existing condition. This leaves 3 over million Washingtonians at risk.
Just a few years ago, people were commonly denied #health insurance for pre-existing conditions. If they didn‚Äôt get a denial, they got some exorbitant rate. That could mean the difference between getting care and not getting care.
We want to make sure patients are not denied access to #healthcare just because of diabetes or asthma or some other pre-existing condition.

Learning to write and read #code is critical to creating and innovating in cyberspace. In high schools, fewer AP exams are taken in #computerscience than any other STEM subject area. While 58% of new STEM jobs are in computing, only 8% of STEM graduates are in computer science.
By reducing the costs of establishing #compsci curriculum, the main barrier to entry for high schools to provide quality #coding classes, my legislation will help prepare the next generation of computer scientists to meet the demands of the #hightech workforce.
Our #agriculture industry is facing unprecedented barriers as American farmers seek to export their products. Increased funding for well-established export programs is what our #farmers need.
In Washington state, only 1,212 students graduated from college with #compsci degrees in 2015, leaving more than 16,200 computing jobs unfilled today. We need to prepare the next generation to meet the demands of the #hightech workforce.
Increased foreign competition, along with trade policies that directly harm U.S. agricultural products, puts our #farmers at a disadvantage and at serious risk of losing out in the foreign #agricultural marketplace.
Today‚Äôs students should be exposed to the computer skills of the 21st Century. By ensuring high school students can access #computerscience and #coding education, we can close the skills gap and boost our country‚Äôs competitive position globally.
As federal support for @USDA's export programs remains stagnant, foreign competitors are increasing funding for #agricultural export programs to grow their international presence. Increased funding for well-established export programs is what our #farmers desperately need.
FACT: The family separation &amp; detention policy adopted by the Trump Administration is not required by U.S. law. Under Section 212 of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act, @DHSgov is legally allowed to provide #humanitarian parole to asylum seekers awaiting immigration proceedings.
In our state &amp; across the nation, our tech industry is booming &amp; creating jobs every day, but curriculum isn't keeping up. By ensuring high school students can access #compsci and #coding education, we can close the skills gap &amp; boost our country‚Äôs competitive position globally.
As American #agricultural products face increasing competition &amp; barriers to entry in markets around the world, funding for effective agricultural export programs is an important tool for American agriculture to remain competitive &amp; continue its role as a driver of the economy.

What is the process for reuniting children separated from their parents at the border? Is it different from the process for other unaccompanied children?
What is the administration doing to proactively find the parents of detained children and help them make contact with their children?
Does the administration have a system to ensure parents in federal custody can speak with their children on a daily basis? Does this system extend to parents who have already been deported from the United States?
Does the administration ensure parents and relatives who are non-English speaking are provided with materials and instructions in their native language, or are translation services provided?
Does the administration have a system to ensure parents or their attorneys can locate their children?
How many children are in the custody of @HHSGov who were separated from their parents at the border and have not yet been reunified with their parents or released to local family members?
While we are encouraged that President Trump has signed an executive order to stop the unnecessary and cruel separation of children from their families, by no means is this crisis over. Here are some of the outstanding questions I still have for the Trump Administration:
Individual businesses that fight every day to get access to Asian markets, to India, to Canada, to Mexico ‚Äîbelieve in a #trade policy that keeps moving forward. Why? Because they gain access to a middle class around the globe.

China responded to Trump's #tariffs with new tariffs on apples, pears, cherries, and wine. üçé For Pacific Northwest #cherries, China is the top export destination. üçí If these tariffs remain, the financial impact to Washington‚Äôs growers will be very harmful.
The Senate must seek answers from the Trump Administration on the standards of care provided to the children rendered unaccompanied by the ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy, including staffing ratios, credentials for contractors &amp; background checks for individuals caring for the children.
President Trump has proposed $7 billion in cuts to the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program. We must never forget what the #CHIP program means for millions of children and their families.
In Washington state, about 110,000 individuals have #Alzheimer‚Äôs, and in 2008, more than 3,000 deaths were attributed to this disease. We must continue to invest in Alzheimer‚Äôs research. #EndAlzheimers https://t.co/L3OWQkuNuW

President Trump has targeted children for budget cuts, needlessly putting their access to health coverage at risk. #CHIP is about giving families the ability to take care of their needs by making sure they have coverage.

We need to protect the internet from being artificially slowed down, from throttling, or from exorbitant prices that would affect startup companies. #NetNeutrality
Senate Republicans voted to give big cable the keys to the internet so they can block, slow down, or manipulate consumer access. They'll give every excuse possible about why they sided with big cable, but one thing is clear: Protecting #NetNeutrality is an economic necessity.
In the United States, just 3 providers of internet access have about 70% of the consumers. In any market with only a few players, it's essential that we protect businesses and consumers, and that is exactly what #NetNeutrality does.

Today is the day the @FCC formally implements its repeal of #netneutrality. I've called on House @SpeakerRyan to schedule a vote on the Senate CRA resolution that overturns the FCC's disastrous decision to repeal net neutrality rules.
Whether you‚Äôre a tech entrepreneur creating the next killer app or a small business owner that sells online, or you work from home or shop online ‚Äì #NetNeutrality is critical to our economy and everyday lives. https://t.co/t2Oki1vpbn
Now that the Senate has taken the critical step of passing a resolution to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #netneutrality, it is incumbent on the House of Representatives to listen to the voices of consumers and keep the internet free and open for all.
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars @SpeakerRyan @AGOWA @mnickelsburg @geekwire Thank you Commissioner, and thank you all for joining us today. Like @JRosenworcel said, #netneutrality is internet freedom. I won‚Äôt stop fighting for this, so let‚Äôs stand together, keep up the noise, and make our voices heard!
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars @SpeakerRyan @AGOWA @mnickelsburg @geekwire Last question for you, Commissioner @JRosenworcel: From your perspective at the @FCC, what can we all do to make sure our voices are heard and to keep all this momentum going? #NetNeutrality
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars @SpeakerRyan @AGOWA In fact, so many Washingtonians have been asking about #netneutrality that last month I sat down with @mnickelsburg of the @GeekWire podcast to talk about this topic specifically.

If you missed it, you can still catch our conversation here:

https://t.co/2BAZ0g3MUg
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars @SpeakerRyan I‚Äôve heard from thousands of Washingtonians who wanted to keep #netneutrality in place. Washington was the first state to pass our own #netneutrality law after the @FCC‚Äôs vote. @AGOWA, our Attorney General, also joined over 20 other state AGs in the lawsuit suing the FCC.
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars Last week, every Democrat in the Senate called on @SpeakerRyan to schedule a House vote on the Senate-passed CRA resolution, but he still hasn‚Äôt acted.
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars A couple of weeks ago, a bipartisan group of Senators successfully passed a Congressional Review Act to overturn the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #netneutrality. Now it goes on to the House for a vote.
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars So without #netneutrality, we could all see this image more often? https://t.co/WbxG3AZGc1
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview @Redfin @DroneSeed @DejavuSecurity @techstars So @JRosenworcel, talk to us about what could happen now that the #netneutrality repeal goes into effect today? How would you explain what this means for all of us who use the internet for work, entertainment, news, or watching our favorite shows?
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council @SpokesmanReview And before that, I joined tech company leaders at @Redfin in Seattle to talk about how critical #netneutrality is to their businesses. Leaders from @DroneSeed, @DejavuSecurity, and @TechStars all stood with me to demand that we protect the free and open internet.
@JRosenworcel @FCC @SpokaneCity @Spokane_Council Here‚Äôs an article about that event from the @SpokesmanReview:

https://t.co/wR99Zk88kn
@JRosenworcel @FCC Without #netneutrality, our local small businesses can‚Äôt compete. Just last month I was at Fellow Coworking in @SpokaneCity to rally support for #netneutrality among local tech startups and the @Spokane_Council.
@JRosenworcel @FCC Absolutely. I‚Äôve met with so many constituents who rely on an open internet for their small businesses to meet new customers or to get into the global marketplace. #DYK the tech industry supports more than 250,000 jobs in my home state of Washington?
@JRosenworcel You‚Äôre absolutely right. #Netneutrality is so important and it impacts all of us. But today is when the @FCC‚Äôs repeal goes into effect. @JRosenworcel, tell us what‚Äôs happening and how did we get here?
The first question I get from constituents is this: What exactly is #netneutrality and why is it so important? @JRosenworcel, what‚Äôs your take?
Well, today is the day. This is when the @FCC‚Äôs repeal of #netneutrality officially goes into effect. I‚Äôm joined by FCC Commissioner @JRosenworcel‚Äîwho voted against this decision. Follow along at #netneutrality to join the conversation. https://t.co/in9iiIFmjy
COMING UP: I‚Äôll be chatting with @FCC Commissioner @JRosenworcel about what today‚Äôs #netneutrality repeal means and what we can do to #savetheinternet for all. Join us at 9:30 AM PDT right here on Twitter. https://t.co/xC1ZtbVlu6
Fires are becoming more lethal. Since 1910, over 1,000 firefighters have died from #wildfires, and more than a quarter of those have occurred in the last 15 years. We want to make sure that every tool is there for our wildland #firefighters.

The #EqualPayAct became law five decades ago, and while we‚Äôve made progress, we still have a long way to go. I want young women growing up today to know this is not an issue they are going to have to deal with in the future. They will get equal pay.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs cruel and unnecessary separations of children from their families run counter to widely accepted standards of care that prioritize keeping children and families together whenever possible. It should end this inhumane policy immediately.
The #EqualPayAct turns 55 years old today and I am proud to continue to stand up in support of fair pay. The #PaycheckFairnessAct would bring us closer to the goal of pay equity and build upon the promise of the Equal Pay Act. https://t.co/5TIhVN6ZAj

I've called on the Trump Administration to reverse course on its inhumane decision to separate children from their parents at the border. This policy has traumatized children who are fleeing extreme violence.
#Airports are a key economic development tool for any community. Most businesses operate within 10 miles of an airport. So continuing to give predictability in an #FAA bill is really critical to our economic growth and to the country. #TakingFlight
I am concerned about President Trump's trade policies. 50% of our #airplanes are sold into overseas markets. When you start putting tariffs on steel &amp; aluminum, there's an impact. We don‚Äôt want to see a trade war erupt &amp; make the U.S. less competitive in the #aviation market.
Now that the Senate has taken the critical step of passing a resolution to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #netneutrality, it is incumbent on the House of Representatives to listen to the voices of consumers and keep the internet free and open for all.
I joined @PattyMurray and 38 of my Senate colleagues to demanding the Trump Administration stop further traumatizing children. It should end its inhumane policy of separating innocent boys and girls from families who cross the Southwest border seeking asylum in the United States.
The amount of support we‚Äôve gathered is a testament to Steve‚Äôs perseverance, determination, unbreakable spirit, and his work to improve the lives of countless people living with #ALS.

Fuel efficiency is critical in the #aviation industry. Who benefits from fuel efficiency? The consumer, with lower fares, the business itself, and our competitiveness. #TakingFlight
I am concerned about President Trump's trade policies. Take a look at #aviation, which employs over 100,000 people in the Northwest in manufacturing jobs of good middle class wages. We don‚Äôt want to lose that competition.
As we approach formal implementation of the @FCC‚Äôs #netneutrality repeal on June 11, I've called on House @SpeakerRyan to schedule a vote on the Senate CRA resolution that overturns the FCC's disastrous decision to repeal net neutrality rules.
Our government has a humanitarian duty to the children and families seeking asylum in the United States. President Trump should immediately end his cruel policy of separating children from their parents at the border.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs push to allow junk insurance plans &amp; eliminate cost-sharing reductions for low-income people is making it harder for Washington families to pay the bills and access care.

In keeping with longstanding legal, ethical &amp; medical standards of #healthcare, Title X providers can offer patients medically-accurate counseling on &amp; referrals for all pregnancy options, including parenting, adoption &amp; abortion. I oppose efforts to undermine #TitleX.
The Trump Administration is carrying out a constant &amp; concerted attack on women‚Äôs health &amp; rights. It is undermining the #TitleX family planning program &amp; implementing a new gag rule that interferes with doctors‚Äô ability to provide patients info about #reproductivecare.
#DidYouKnow: Each year, roughly 4,000,000 people rely on #TitleX-funded health centers for basic preventive health care, including cancer screenings, birth control, STI screenings, pregnancy testing, and well-woman exams.
The doctor shortage for our rural communities continues, and we need to fight that. We have counties in our state that have 4,000 people and no access to #healthcare. We‚Äôve got to do better.

https://t.co/41IXtI97iG
Title X has helped women avoid 822,000 unintended pregnancies. It also yields critical cost savings to our #healthcare system‚Äîevery $1 invested in #TitleX saves more than $7 in Medicaid-related costs.

Nearly two-thirds of #TitleX patients have incomes at or below the federal poverty level, and 43% of patients are uninsured. In 2016, nearly 4,000 Title X-funded health centers provided 720,000 Pap tests, nearly 1 million women with breast exams, and 1.2 million HIV tests.

One year ago today, President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. We must all redouble our efforts to reduce emissions and find innovative ways to fight #climatechange because our current president never will.
These tariffs put that opportunity in jeopardy, along with putting other U.S. exports to Canada and the European Union at risk. The Administration must resolve these disputes through negotiations.

President Trump should use all of his authority to take timely action to pressure #OPEC and cooperating countries to increase world oil supplies in order to lower #GasPrices at the pump during the upcoming summer driving season. https://t.co/Mjvmt9qm6S
Today I joined @SenSchumer, @SenatorMenendez, and @SenMarkey to urge President Trump to take action to lower #GasPrices for American families.

https://t.co/pyBWZxgKt0
We don't want to see the price of #oil get more expensive as we go into the summer #driving season. It's already 60 cents higher per gallon than last year. This affects the consumer, the driving public, and our businesses that depend on transport. #GasPrices https://t.co/poghcIU6BP
This #MemorialDayWeekend is the start of the driving season &amp; the average American household will pay $167 more in fuel costs this summer. That is sticker shock to the American family, what they are seeing could get worse, and that is why we are calling on President Trump to act. https://t.co/nEoxlYEOJN
According to AAA, average #GasPrices in Washington state are currently the 3rd highest in the country at $3.40, and in some areas, closer to $4 per gallon. How much are you paying to fill the tank? ‚õΩ
Today, my colleagues and I are signing a letter calling on President Trump to pressure #OPEC to increase world #oil supplies, help lower the price at the pump, and save the consumer during their most expensive time‚Äîthe summer driving season. #GasPrices https://t.co/IfTpI6XyFQ
#GasPrices have gone up 25% since the #GOP tax law went into effect. So as families are facing higher prices at the pump, corporations have gotten some of the largest tax breaks in our history. ü§î
During the #summer driving season, consumers would rather be taking #vacations and preserving their businesses and economic opportunities than paying more at the pump. I guarantee you, what they got in the tax break just got washed away in higher fuel prices. #GasPrices https://t.co/AP89iDtTur
The impact of rising #gasprices on family budgets &amp; our economy is significant &amp; widespread. According to a recent analysis, the run up in oil prices will roughly cancel out positive effects from #taxcuts this year, with the greatest impact on those that can least afford it.
Our state has 5 of the highest threat #volcanoes in the nation, and they are a persistent and serious threat. Our legislation will ensure we have the science, technology, and monitoring needed to keep people informed and safe.

Our Democratic colleagues in the House are taking up the fight for an open and free internet. But now it‚Äôs time for House Republicans to decide: will they stand with big cable or will they stand with consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses? #NetNeutrality
Senate Republicans voted today to give big cable the keys to the internet so they can block, slow down, or manipulate consumer access. They'll give every excuse possible about why they sided with big cable, but 1 thing is clear: Protecting #NetNeutrality is an economic necessity.
Getting exorbitant internet fees from cable providers is not the direction the American people want to go. Entrepreneurs, innovators, and consumers cannot afford to take that hit. What they want to see is an #openinternet that continues to allow the internet economy to flourish.
Whether you‚Äôre a tech entrepreneur creating the next killer app or a small business owner that sells online, or you work from home or shop online ‚Äì #NetNeutrality is critical to our economy and everyday lives.
Today we know that internet is a basic necessity. When a service is that essential and critical to a community and its economic success, we need to make sure that consumers have protections. #NetNeutrality
In the United States, just 3 providers of internet access have about 70% of the consumers. In any market with only a few players, it's essential that we protect businesses and consumers, and that is exactly what #NetNeutrality does.
#BREAKING: Today is a win for small business owners, entrepreneurs, and consumers. 49 Democrats and 3 Republicans stood up and said that the internet economy is too important to let a few big cable companies slow down or block content. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/of9EHLzzgy

If we pass this #NetNeutrality resolution in the Senate, focus will turn to the House. We hope our colleagues will do their homework and understand that while some of the cable companies have been successful, they can have undue power and influence on controlling access.
By repealing #NetNeutrality, the @FCC is giving cable companies the ability to raise your rates even more. That's what this debate is about. There has to be a free and open internet. Let's get back to innovation and creating more jobs, not artificially slowing down the internet.
The Senate vote on #NetNeutrality is scheduled for tomorrow. We still have time to act as consumers, voters, &amp; Washingtonians to say loud and clear: Do not negatively impact the #openinternet with rules that give cable companies the ability to slow down or throttle the internet.
What is the @FCC saying to the online world of next-generation startups? That you have to add a layer of expense just because of its #NetNeutrality ruling? And now you need even more capital or you won‚Äôt be able to compete? Those are all the wrong messages. #ProtectNetNeutrality
Tech innovators got to where they are today by having an open internet &amp; a level playing field. The #NetNeutrality debate is about cable versus internet‚Äî it's about big cable companies who want to charge more versus start-ups and individuals who want access to new applications.
Make no mistake about it ‚Äì #NetNeutrality is an economic empowerment issue. In an information age, information is the critical tool, whether you‚Äôre seeking an education, seeking to participate in commerce, or seeking information in healthcare. https://t.co/rXTc2VAxqN

The housing crisis affects so many people‚Äîreturning veterans, retiring baby boomers, and people in need of workforce housing. Too many people are paying more than 50% of their income for housing. #NationalHousingWeekofAction #OurHomesOurVoices
Where‚Äôs the accountability for drug manufacturers who aren‚Äôt working with @DEAHQ to stop excessive #opioid distribution? Currently the fines for manufacturers are a mere $10,000 for neglect in reporting. I‚Äôm asking for a tenfold increase for not reporting negligent distribution.
#DEA classifies opioids as a dangerous substance with high potential for abuse. That‚Äôs why we created a strong network of laws on distribution. #Opioids need to be tracked &amp; reported, suspicious orders red-flagged, and the distribution communicated so that @DEAHQ can do its job.
We are not done helping #Hanford workers. We want to continue to improve the federal claims process, we have to be vigilant, and we have to respect the tremendous amount of sacrifice that so many Hanford workers have made over generations.

We have passed a down payment on the #opioidcrisis but we‚Äôre working on a larger response. This crisis is killing too many Washingtonians, it‚Äôs killing too many Americans, and we need better tools to handle this.

There is currently a nationwide shortage of more than 7 million affordable rental homes, an increase from the 4.4 million gap in 2000. #NationalHousingWeekofAction #OurHomesOurVoices
We have to get at the problem of not tracking and seeing the signs of excessive #opioid distribution. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for a tenfold increase in the fine for manufacturers who neglect to report such distribution.

Because of his work with Congress, Steve Gleason has improved the lives of countless people living with #ALS by helping them secure access to the latest speech-generating technology. That's why we're pushing to #HonorGleason with the #CongressionalGoldMedal.
Large quantities of #opioids are flooding our communities. In @EverettCity, 1 physician wrote over 10K prescriptions of the highly-addictive Oxycontin‚Äî26 times the city's average. Drug companies that fail to report suspicious distribution practices should face federal penalties.
I've introduced legislation to increase federal funding for #opioid education, treatment, and recovery programs and to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for negligent distribution and misleading advertising. This epidemic has afflicted every area of society.
I visited @SeaTacAirport with @TSA_Pekoske this morning to discuss new automated screening lanes, passenger screening canines, and efforts to address increasing passenger traffic at the airport. As our economy continues to grow, so does traffic at #SeaTac.

I fought to secure $3.3 billion in the recent spending deal to combat the #opioid &amp; mental health epidemics. This funding provides critical investments in medication-assisted treatment, #naloxone for first responders, &amp; funds for additional treatment and recovery services.
Snohomish County was an early adopter of using #naloxone to help prevent #opioid overdoses &amp; the county has already used it to save 185 lives. By bringing down the cost of naloxone, we can get this life-saving drug in the hands of more people. Doing so will save lives.

Our legislation to #HonorGleason with the #CongressionalGoldMedal is now cosponsored by 34 senators‚Äîhalfway to the support needed to move forward. Steve Gleason is an inspiration to all of us. Spokane and Washington state couldn‚Äôt be more proud to call him one of our own.
In @SnoCounty, 90 people died from #opioid and #heroin overdoses in 2016‚Äîthat's roughly 18 percent of all Washington state heroin-related deaths. Nearly 700 Washingtonians &amp; 42,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose in 2016 alone. It‚Äôs time we fight back.

Since 2015, @EximBankUS has not had a fully operational board able to review &amp; approve the types of deals that would expand U.S. exports. Foreign export credit agencies are filling the void, meaning more U.S. jobs will be sent overseas and U.S. workers &amp; companies disadvantaged.

The weather is drier &amp; we‚Äôre seeing more #wildfires &amp; homes destroyed. Now is not the time to cut Forest Service research. To get ahead of the problem, we need robust science. @ForestService‚Äôs Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Lab in Seattle is an example of that kind of research.

Our #wildfire funding fix reauthorized @ForestService's Secure Rural Schools program for 2 more years. This is so important for the #PacificNorthwest because it ensures communities aren‚Äôt left without funding while we look to create permanent solutions.
We need to invest in our #NationalParks. It‚Äôs not only good for the outdoor economy and for our citizens, but it‚Äôs part of what helps fund our U.S. economy. #NationalParkWeek #FindYourPark
Thanks to our #wildfire funding fix, the @ForestService will no longer have to borrow funding from other programs to get firefighters to the fire line, and it won‚Äôt need to transfer money from land management accounts to pay for funding.

President Trump‚Äôs nominee to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has tried to take away reproductive rights for women, he‚Äôs defended restrictive voting laws, and he‚Äôs argued against same-sex marriage. I opposed his confirmation and urged my colleagues to do the same.
We are committed to making health insurance premiums more affordable for all consumers &amp; expanding the number of options. Creating a new class of health insurance plans that lack basic patient protections &amp; could lead to higher prices does not achieve this goal.
I‚Äôve joined 46 senators to call on the Trump Admin to halt a proposed regulation that would create junk insurance plans. The proposal to expand short-term healthcare plans that don't protect patients would raise premiums &amp; harm millions living with pre-existing conditions.

There is currently a nationwide shortage of more than 7 million affordable rental homes, an increase from the 4.4 million gap in 2000. Securing #LIHTC funding in this week's spending bill is a good step toward addressing the crisis.
The affordable housing crisis continues to worsen in this country &amp; the total number of Americans facing extreme housing unaffordability has ballooned. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been fighting to boost affordable housing nationwide &amp; why the #LIHTC funding secured is so important. https://t.co/CzsFi9BQbd

This forestry and wildfire funding boost will allow the @ForestService to prioritize work in areas closest to communities, in order to save lives and reduce the risk of property damage, while still protecting essential public lands and existing environmental laws.

A year ago I called for a comprehensive assessment of cyber attacks to our grid by Russians. I repeatedly asked the Trump administration to tackle this urgent task &amp; make sure we have an assessment. If the @FBI &amp; @DHSgov‚Äôs recent admission isn't a siren then I don‚Äôt know what is.
Our energy infrastructure is under attack. It‚Äôs under cyber attack, and we need to do much more to protect it as a national critical asset. Russia has proven its ability to disrupt the grid.
President Trump‚Äôs proposed budget would kill science, innovation, and @ENERGY jobs by eliminating ARPA-E and making drastic cuts to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electricity.

https://t.co/NaocKCxLKN
#CARA2 is a bipartisan bill that will provide expanded treatment, education, and prevention to combat the growing #opioidcrisis. Importantly, this legislation strengthens penalties on drug manufacturers who negligently distribute #opioids in our communities.
The Department of @Energy is a science and technology powerhouse, yet the President‚Äôs proposed budget slashes many of DOE‚Äôs essential programs and I think would be devastating to our clean-energy economy.

I am disappointed by the Trump administration‚Äôs approach to the #Hanford cleanup. Its proposal for FY19 cuts Hanford by $230 million from FY17 that was enacted. Instead of the cut, Hanford needs an increase of $200 million in order to keep workers safe and meet milestones.
I‚Äôve urged Senate leaders to direct funding to tribal communities to address the ongoing #opioidepidemic in Indian Country. Funding to address this crisis must take a holistic approach &amp; support these communities to put them on a path to healing &amp; improve outcomes.

We do not believe the 23 announced ‚Äúopen house‚Äù meetings are adequate in duration, location, nor format needed to meet the public input requirements. Formal oral testimony, as opposed to open house format, would better ensure that people‚Äôs concerns are heard &amp; recorded publicly.
These public hearings are a critical opportunity for citizens to learn about and comment on the @Interior Department's five year #offshoredrilling plan, and due to the geographic extent of the proposed leasing program, it is imperative to provide adequate access for each region.
We believe a 60-day extension of the deadline for comments is necessary to allow for more public hearings in coastal areas and to give the public sufficient time to submit comments on offshore drilling.
Today I led 22 of my Senate colleagues in demanding a 60-day extension of the public comment period for the Department of the @Interior‚Äôs offshore drilling plan.
Yes we do. Offshore drilling poses a direct threat to Washington state communities, economies, and ecosystems. #ProtectOurCoast https://t.co/W8ZyiR5HLw
We need a full and fair opportunity for the most directly impacted stakeholders to provide feedback on the Trump Administration‚Äôs plan to open our coasts to dangerous offshore drilling. @SecretaryZinke must extend the comment period. #ProtectOurCoast

#ArcticRefuge: Many people over many decades have fought for this great area of our country to maintain its environmental stewardship. Republicans are trying to throw it away to pay for tax breaks for corporations.
Get this: The #GOPTaxBill REQUIRES that the #ArcticRefuge be managed as a petroleum reserve.
The #GOPTaxBill could never pass through regular order. And under this sham process, one of our nation‚Äôs wildest and most pristine areas will be turned into an oil field.
The #arcticrefuge is home to:
 
47 different species of mammals ‚Äì including Polar bears, grizzlies, caribou
 
40 species of fish 
 
200 species of birds
 
Why would we destroy this? Why? https://t.co/ZPln8H6cSe
Do not sacrifice the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. Don't take one of the great wild, pristine places on this planet and turn it into an oil field. We can do better as a nation.
We didn't create the Arctic Coastal Plain, but I can tell you this: We cannot recreate it.

Under this #GOPtaxscam 35.08 million middle class households will see a tax INCREASE by 2027 via Joint Committee on Taxation. The #GOPtaxplan gives more than a trillion dollar tax break to Wall Street, but leaves Main Street and middle class families behind.
Gouging middle class families to pay for corporate tax breaks is just wrong. We need tax reform that invests in the middle class and grows our economy from the middle out.

NEW: JCT info TODAY exposes false GOP claims that #GOPTaxBill doesn‚Äôt raise taxes on middle-class families: In 2027, families earning less than $75,000 see an over $27 BILLION tax increase, yet millionaires get a tax cut of $5.5 billion
ICYMI: Yesterday Senate Republicans attached a measure opening up the #ArcticRefuge to #OilandGas drilling to budget legislation, which needs only 50 votes to pass the Senate #ProtectTheArctic https://t.co/RNLOIP6Oa0
TAKEAWAY: Under the #GOPTaxBill Americans making between $10,000 to 30,000 in 2027 will see nearly a $15 BILLION dollar tax HIKE while millionaires get a $5.5 BILLION dollar tax CUT. #GOPTaxPlan https://t.co/pv1VOH7u9R
Why is it that the President of the United States deserves a $32 million dollar tax break under this #GOPTaxPlan &amp; my constituent, a military veteran who is struggling to make ends meet, could be met with a #tax increase?
This situation merits immediate action by DHS. I urge DHS to reverse this decision to reject #DACA renewal requests that were received after the deadline due to mail delays https://t.co/b0lK9uxUDJ
Why are we rushing this process? Why are we trying to rush this dark-of-night #GOPTaxPlan to change our tax code in ways that we can‚Äôt even get answers on for our constituents?
I joined a group of concerned @SenateDems to call on DHS to take immediate action &amp; reverse decision to reject #DACA renewal requests received after the deadline due to a Postal Service processing delay https://t.co/b0lK9uxUDJ
I don‚Äôt know if the @SenateGOP is trying to break a speed record for passing a major tax bill?‚Äì but it‚Äôs clear this #GOPTaxPlan needs to be slowed down. We need to get this right.
Republicans need to go back &amp; cut corporate loop holes instead of doing the opposite &amp; giving foreign oil companies a $4 billion dollar tax break in addition to cuts in the corporate rate #GOPTaxPlan
More than 300K people in the state of WA state could pay as much as $900 dollars more under this #GOPTaxPlan ‚Äì and for what? To give tax breaks to corporations? 
I don‚Äôt think so.
We're fighting to #ProtectTheArctic from drilling in the #ArcticRefuge when 27 different scientists &amp; biologists have said #OilandGas exploration is incompatible with the purpose of the #ArcticRefuge

This @SenateGOP effort to open up the #ArcticRefuge to #OilandGas exploration does NOT protect environmental law or stewardship &amp; it‚Äôs very frustrating we‚Äôre being asked to vote on legislation incompatible with the purpose of the refuge #ProtectTheArctic

This #GOPTaxPlan proposing to raise taxes on 14 million Americans &amp; 300,000 in WA state is not simply raising taxes on just a few people ‚Äì these are middle-class families striving for the American dream &amp; they deserve better
Under this #GOPTaxPlan, the average Seattle school teacher &amp; police officer, with two kids &amp; a new house, working hard to live the American dream, will pay $900 dollars MORE in taxes. That means less money to save for #college or #retirement, for groceries &amp; for a rainy day https://t.co/AZ0BqwyoTS
This isn‚Äôt simplification of our tax code ‚Äì it‚Äôs simply raising taxes on middle-class families #GOPTaxPlan https://t.co/5sz0JsiJEF
A big chunk of this #GOPTaxPlan would be paid for on the backs of middle-class families by taking away their tax deductions like state &amp; local sales tax &amp; property tax deductions. This isn‚Äôt simplification of our tax code ‚Äì it‚Äôs simply raising taxes on middle-class families.
Getting rids of important tax deductions, this #GOPTaxPlan is simply making housing more expensive ‚Äì at a time when we have a record number of Americans in unaffordable housing situations &amp; a growing #HousingCrisis
The #GOPTaxPlan isn‚Äôt a simplification of our tax code ‚Äì it‚Äôs simply raising taxes on middle-class families in my state and its raising taxes on millions of Americans across the United States to give a tax break to corporations!
We don‚Äôt want a #Taxbill that gives tax breaks to corporations on the backs of middle-class families who take deductions for education or their property tax or sales tax. There are better ways to do #TaxReform than this horrible #GopTaxPlan
It is very wrong-headed that our @SenateGOP colleagues are choosing to give tax breaks to corporations on the backs of hard-working, middle-class families #GOPTaxPlan
I‚Äôm at the @SenateFinance markup of the #GOPTaxPlan to say: This process is a sham and this bill is flawed. It simply raises taxes on middle-class families in WA state &amp; across the country https://t.co/i93dwShySi
A #TaxBill that puts a greater tax burden on the middle-class and makes it harder for them to keep their home &amp;  AffordableHousing options is a bad idea

We CAN do better than this rushed #GOPTaxPlan giving tax breaks to corporations on the backs of working-class families in America, taking away viable deductions for education, housing &amp; property taxes

"Republicans in Congress have added a proposal to allow oil drilling in a long-disputed Alaskan #WildlifeRefuge to their tax reform bill, but experts say that #oilandgas companies might not even be interested." #ProtectTheArctic https://t.co/nd7J8qaI27
That's why I joined @senorrinhatch to introduce the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Improvement Act, something that will help us build hundreds of thousands of new #AffordableHousing units in the next 10 years
The good news is we have good bipartisan support for the #LIHTC. Enacted in 1986 ‚Äì it‚Äôs helped build 3 million rental units across this country over the last 30 years
We need a very big systematic investment in #AffordableHousing all across the United States. And expanding the #LIHTC is one of the best ways to do that
The combination of increased demand and lack of production has caused the explosion of our #AffordableHousing crisis. We need to #ExpandLIHTC to fill the gap
The United States has become a rent-burdened economy, and if we don't address the #AffordableHousing crisis, the problem is only going to get worse

In 2008 we bailed out big banks while everyone else‚Äôs 401k, pensions &amp; retirement savings took a hit. But again the GOP wants to limit 401ks

This action will threaten #healthcare insurance for millions of Americans https://t.co/MiJD72IKm8
Instead of cutting people off #healthcare insurance the President should be working across the aisle to drive down costs &amp; increase access
One way to cut #healthcare costs is let states bundle people like Basic Health Plan does aka 'the Costco model': buy in bulk, get a discount
We have good #healthcare ideas working right now, like giving states the ability to bundle people like we've done in WA w/ Basic Health Plan
#PuertoRico should not have to wait any longer for assistance to begin the long process of rebuilding their #infrastructure &amp; communities

There's nothing good about #GrahamCassidy kicking 15M people off #Medicaid. We must get this right the #healthcare of America too important
I'd never have guessed a decade after passing the bipartisan #DreamAct we'd be fighting an Admin trying to strip protections from #DREAMers
17,000 #DREAMers working, going to school, supporting their families &amp; WA‚Äôs economy need the certainty to contribute &amp; live out their dreams
We should tell #DREAMers they have a chance in our country &amp; economy &amp; continue moving forward on passing comprehensive #immigration reform https://t.co/0hd1Lap5xW
We must make sure we are giving #DREAMers - who contribute so much to our country - the certainty they deserve &amp; pass a permanent #DACA fix
NOW: I'm with @PattyMurray @RepAdamSmith @RepJayapal calling on Republicans to #DefendDACA, protect #DREAMers

Bipartisan governors' letter is something we must listen to because the affordability of #healthcare is important https://t.co/wwnTbswEP3
#Medicaid - in helping our most vulnerable citizens gain access to #affordable health care, ends up reducing everybody's #healthcare costs
We can never forget what the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program means for families &amp; the kids impacted #CHIPworks https://t.co/x6bCrTgk91
Graham-Cassidy basically ends the 52-yr state/federal partnership that is #Medicaid
https://t.co/3pqdD1XEJZ
Republicans‚Äô push to again repeal the #ACA w/o a successful strategy to move our nation forward is very distressing https://t.co/6wprSb7DEc
FACT: #Medicaid helps the most vulnerable Americans gain access to affordable coverage which ends up reducing everybody's #healthcare costs
Giving our most vulnerable people affordable access to care is a priority because it actually reduces everyone's #healthcare costs #Medicaid
We have the ability to work together &amp; we're not going to take the bait that cutting essential services is an answer https://t.co/TFzLFg6jnC
Repealing #DACA will impose severe harm. Not only on 800,000 #DREAMers nationally but on communities across America. We need the #DreamAct https://t.co/JnzFfRvcYM
We expect due process &amp; facts to guide our President's actions, not repeated falsehoods about immigrants &amp; #DREAMers. We must #DefendDACA https://t.co/E2oLmXm08a
Like many immigrants before them, brave young #DREAMers strengthen our economy &amp; are valued members of our communities #DefendDACA #DreamAct
#DACA allows young #DREAMers to pursue their dreams to become teachers, doctors &amp; entrepreneurs in our communities. Must pass the #DreamAct

10 bipartisan governors are telling us to slow down &amp; work on #healthcare on a bipartisan basis. Not #GrahamCassidy https://t.co/9zXBuS0Yv3
The #GrahamCassidy #Trumpcare bill is just one more sneak attack by our colleagues at kicking people off of #Medicaid https://t.co/gpqoZ6ichX
Republicans are trying once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a successful strategy to move our nation forward #GrahamCassidy
We should be finding bipartisan solutions to improve #healthcare coverage for millions of Americans. #GrahamCassidy https://t.co/XpBX8FFIIn
I said it before &amp; I say it again to my Republican colleagues: Don‚Äôt play politics with #healthcare. #GrahamCassidy https://t.co/D3zZYn3sb0

My colleagues must take #DACA seriously &amp; move towards legislation. It's simple: either you want to protect these young people, or you don't
Since 2001 I have been a supporter of the #DREAMAct &amp; I cannot believe that this is the message from our President to thousands of #DREAMers
In a remarkable act of courage and trust, 17,500+ young #DREAMers today are working &amp; contributing to our economy in the state of Washington
#DACA has given certainty &amp; predictability to so many young #DREAMers brought to the USA not through their own actions ‚Äì but others‚Äô actions
The President's decision to end #DACA runs counter to the long-standing &amp; proud history in WA state of welcoming immigrants &amp; #DREAMers
This repeal will impose severe harm not only on 800,000 #DACA recipients but the broader community. Congress must work to pass the #DREAMAct

In nearly all circumstances, engaging in #immigration raids to detain people is unnecessary and damaging to our communities #DefendDACA
#DACA recipients have been carefully vetted &amp; granted permission to work, a clear indication DACA recipients are not an enforcement priority
Repeated falsehoods about #immigrants and #refugees, suspicion &amp; allegations is unacceptable, and we demand better #DefendDACA #DACAWorks
Nearly 790,000 #Dreamers have received #DACA allowing them to contribute to our country as teachers, nurses, engineers &amp; #SmallBiz owners
We must #DefendDACA &amp; thereby allow a generation of young immigrants with great potential to continue contributing to our society &amp; economy
According to @CatoInstitute deporting #DACA recipients would cost us over $60B &amp; a $280B reduction in economic growth over the next decade
We invested in Dreamers. It makes no sense to squander their talents by deporting them to countries they don't know or remember #DefendDACA
Today on the 5th anniversary of #DACA‚Äôs implementation, we recommit to #DefendDACA &amp; pass the #DreamAct &amp; comprehensive #immigration reform https://t.co/T9giq7wAim

Your stories, your phone calls, your emails, your advocacy, and all of your hard work paid off. Now we must chart a path to progress.

The fact @SeanteGOP are trying to pass a bill that no one has seen, just shows you ‚Äì people are very worried about any #Trumpcare proposal
My Republican colleagues are trying to jam #Trumpcare through the only way they can: get something passed, no matter what it is.
I've worked hard to make Congress recognize the value of freight &amp; transportation infrastructure to states like WA &amp; secure critical funding

This @SenateGOP version of a "skinny" #ACA repeal bill would result in premiums roughly 20% higher than under current law each year -@USCBO
Senate Republicans' rumored ‚Äúskinny‚Äù #Obamacare repeal bill could lead to 16 MILLION MORE Americans being uninsured -@USCBO
Our nation's governors, Democrat &amp; Republican, understand they must be a partner on #Medicaid because their citizens depend on it
The message from governors ‚Äì even Republican governors ‚Äì is clear: Protect #Medicaid. I hope my Republican colleagues will listen to them
#Medicaid boosts economic health too, reducing bankruptcy rates, cutting uncompensated care in half &amp; giving families access to #healthcare
@SenateGOP‚Äôs plan to pull the rug out from under #Medicaid recipients will hurt Americans, hurt jobs &amp; hurt economies across our nation
More than 600,000 in WA have gained coverage through #Medicaid expansion; we cannot allow this War on Medicaid to continue
Today I'm offering a measure to be voted on this afternoon to protect #Medicaid &amp; the Medicaid expansion from devastating cuts https://t.co/SrUaeuumMn
Transgender servicemembers are honorable &amp; patriotic. Discrimination in any form is unacceptable. We must defeat this discriminatory policy.

Thank you to everyone who is keeping up the fight against this disastrous Republican #HealthCare bill, we must continue to be loud! https://t.co/wDwL7P0opc
Today I voted NO on the motion to proceed to Republican‚Äôs #ACA repeal. Here‚Äôs my full statement: https://t.co/McyhatNHCv
@SenateGOP I will continue to use every tool at my disposal to protect #healthcare for Washingtonians and all Americans
@SenateGOP Today‚Äôs motion to proceed formally declares a war on #Medicaid, and is a key step in taking #healthcare away from millions of Americans
@SenateGOP Instead, come work with us to fix the individual market and improve the Affordable Care Act #SaveACA
Since January, I have been repeating the same message to my @SenateGOP colleagues: don‚Äôt kick millions of Americans off of #healthcare
I ask my Republican colleagues to stop &amp; think about the millions of Americans who are scared to death about what is going to happen today.
With today's vote @SenateGOP is saying: Jump off the cliff &amp; oh, by the way, I'll throw you a parachute on the way down. This doesn't work.
The people of the United States have spoken very clearly. They're not interested in cutting millions of Americans off of #Healthcare
Now hours from a vote: We still don't know on what bill &amp; Americans still don't know if their #healthcare will be repealed w/ no replacement

If Mr. Clement‚Äôs claims are true, this is unacceptable. @SecretaryZinke must explain his agency‚Äôs actions https://t.co/ExNBEtasvD
It‚Äôs mean of the @SenateGOP to keep Americans in the dark about a bill that could devastate their #healthcare future
I want to know if the Department of the @Interior is silencing #science. https://t.co/ExNBEts3Ud
The Trump Administration is singling out the @Interior Department‚Äôs scientists. I will not allow this to continue. https://t.co/ExNBEts3Ud
It appears once again that the Trump Administration is hostile towards those who have dedicated their lives to civil service.
I am asking the @Interior Inspector General to investigate Mr. Clement‚Äôs claims https://t.co/ExNBEts3Ud

In the #ACA we successfully changed the delivery system &amp; made improvements so patients are put at the front of the system
There are things that are working in the #ACA: the expansion of Medicaid has driven down price &amp; given #healthcare access to more Americans
Let's talk about what's working &amp; let's discuss what‚Äôs not with #healthcare ‚Äì but we cannot cut millions of Americans off #Medicaid
The notion by Republicans that you can repeal the #ACA &amp; achieve "#BetterCare" by cutting millions of Americans off #Medicaid, is dead wrong https://t.co/Xzia1zyfcl

Passing the #LIHTC is critical to addressing our #HousingCrisis. Thank you @HousingACTION for your strong #AffordableHousing advocacy https://t.co/X2X88EgznE
TUNE IN NOW: To @ChrisJansing on @MSNBC, SOON I'm talking #healthcare strategy moving forward on a busy day in the #Senate
Let‚Äôs make sure people are covered, we're making improvements in #healthcare delivery &amp; keeping on a trajectory of ensuring we lower costs
In the #ACA under the Basic Health Plan we gave individuals as much clout in the market as large companies. This is a real solution.
Stop the War on #Medicaid. Stop the #ACA repeal. Let‚Äôs work across the aisle to focus on driving down #healthcare costs for Americans https://t.co/UlOJ8veMLO
GOP plan will cut people off #Medicaid and run up uncompensated care costs making insurance more expensive for all https://t.co/zdA19J0ROl
#JunkInsurance plans could charge people more or simply deny them coverage based on pre-existing conditions https://t.co/iDjTC9FKRK
TUNE IN NOW: I'm joining @SRuhle &amp; @AliVelshi on @MSNBC to talk #Trumpcare, #JunkInsurance &amp; more
Let's improve #healthcare affordability &amp; not think that a #JunkInsurance plan or cutting people off #Medicaid is a solution for our future
@SenateGOP Keisha is one of millions of Americans who are scared that they're going to lose their #healthinsurance under the @SenateGOP #Trumpcare plan
Keisha is concerned that as @SenateGOP moves forward with the #ACA repeal she &amp; her husband could be overwhelmed with crushing hospital debt
Keisha told me her daughter required specialized, expensive treatment as a newborn but thanks to #ACA was covered as a preexisting condition
At my #CantwellTownHall I met a young woman, Keisha, who told me about her daughter who was born prematurely &amp; weighed less than two pounds
#JunkInsurance plans will cause #healthcare insurers to pull out of the individual insurance market &amp; a death spiral due to soaring costs
I believe our goal should be to drive down the cost of #healthcare insurance NOT drive people out of the insurance market. NO #JunkInsurance
The CBO says if you can't go to the hospital and get care with your insurance ‚Äì then it's not really insurance. I agree. NO #JunkInsurance
It turns out #JunkInsurance plans... don't even count as insurance &amp; everybody in the real insurance market would end up having to pay more
This bill is still a War on Medicaid, still permanently cuts &amp; caps the #Medicaid program &amp; is still mean. https://t.co/xOP5edFLGk
#JunkInsurance provision could deny coverage of essential benefits incl. hospitalization, maternity &amp; preventive care &amp; prescription drugs
#JunkInsurance provision would let insurers sell plans that, according to the CBO, aren't real insurance, as long as they sell one real plan
The newest @SenateGOP #healthcare bill is still a War on Medicaid that will hurt millions of Americans, our health care system &amp; our economy
President Trump &amp; Secretary Zinke must honor their promises &amp; not alter protections to safeguard #NationalMonuments https://t.co/xDREIkvILa

Roll back of #NetNeutrality by @FCC will impact how you watch movies, listen to music, do homework &amp; business, connect with friends &amp; family
Slow lanes for #SmallBiz &amp; consumers are unacceptable. We can‚Äôt let big cable companies harm #OpenInternet access &amp; our #internet economy
