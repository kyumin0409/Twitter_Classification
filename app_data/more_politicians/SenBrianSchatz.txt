To me, Judge Kavanaugh is not just a conservative jurist. He's not John Roberts. He's not even Neil Gorsuch. He's a Republican operative who is posing as a judge. https://t.co/q2K7szupSj
Today, we remember the many heroes and neighbors lost in the 9-11 attacks. Seventeen years later, the courage and unity shown by so many on that fateful day still inspires us to come together, to serve, and to do something that’s bigger than ourselves.
This resolution also “condemns attacks on the institution of the free press and views efforts to systematically undermine the credibility of the press as a whole as an attack on our democratic institution.”
.@SenSchumer &amp; I have introduced a resolution that does just this. It affirms that the press is not the enemy of the people. And it reaffirms the vital role the free press serves to inform the electorate, uncover truth, act as a check &amp; advance democratic norms &amp; freedoms.
These words of past leaders should inspire this body to act—to send a message that we support the First Amendment, and we support the freedom of the press.
Or Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote that “the First Amendment is often inconvenient. But that is beside the point. Inconvenience does not absolve the government of its obligation to tolerate speech.”
Or President Reagan, who said that “freedom of the press is one of our most important freedoms, and also one of our oldest.
Or James Madison, who said that “the freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.”
We can't let statements by @POTUS declaring the press is the enemy of the people go unchallenged. Both parties complain about the media but who would argue w/ Thomas Jefferson who wrote: “our liberty depends on the freedom of the press &amp; that cannot be limited without being lost”
Every member of Congress has sworn to uphold the Constitution, including the right to the #FreePress. I’m introducing a bill to uphold our oath and make clear that we support liberty and free speech. WATCH LIVE: https://t.co/mdWfjFcLlX
The Senate has passed my proposal directing the federal government to assess how Kilauea has hurt farmers and ranchers.

12 of my Democratic colleagues &amp; I read a letter written by 54 parents being detained at the Port Isabel Detention Center.

The people at our borders are human beings. They have left behind friends, families, and most of what they own to come to our border because they have no other choice. This #WorldRefugeeDay, it’s incumbent on everyone to remember that.
Usually the United States spends #WorldRefugeeDay highlighting how we help refugees. But today, we’re facing our own human rights crisis at the southern border. This is not who we are. The forced separation of families is a moral outrage, and must end. #WithRefugees
All 49 @SenateDems have signed on to a bill that stops this madness. The Senate is split 51-49. That means it only takes two senators to put an end to this moral crisis. Now is the time to raise our voices every single way we know how. https://t.co/YBGUBeOOUX

“New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success: for an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that as the family goes, so goes our civilization.” –Ronald Reagan
“We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.” -Melania Trump
“I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.” -Laura Bush
“The bosom of America is open to receive not only the Opulent and respected Stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions; whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges…” -George Washington
“Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.’” -Matthew 19:13-14
“When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” -Leviticus 19:33-34
We can disagree on immigration policy. But we cannot disagree on what’s happening at our southern border. It is a moral outrage. And you do not have to take my word for it.
The Appropriations Committee just passed a bill that includes $1M for Papahanaumokuakea and for coral reefs, and more than $36M to fund Hawaii’s tsunami warning system. This new funding is critical for our state priorities – glad to see it moving forward. https://t.co/pAaeZuybZT

So we will continue to shine a light on the many ways this administration is failing the American people by ignoring climate change. But we will also continue to hope.
These efforts are making a difference. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that the United States can meet our original commitment to the Paris Agreement, even if the EPA continues to undermine our efforts.
When it comes to the Paris Agreement, U.S. companies, states, and cities have stood up to declare “We Are Still In.”
The economics are on our side. Clean energy is now cheaper than dirty energy. We continue to move to a low-carbon economy.
The rest of the world is moving forward. Every single nation in the world is working to lower their emissions and meet their commitments as part of the Paris Agreement.

Today, #KingKamehamehaDay, Senator Schatz delivered a major floor speech urging equal treatment for Native Hawaiians. http://t.co/7M7QmyPzg4
That is why today - on Kamehameha Day - I call upon all of us to join in the fight for justice for Native Hawaiians.
It is long past time for the Native Hawaiian people to regain their right to self-governance.
Separate is not equal, and that is why I urge the federal government to treat Native Hawaiians fairly.
...data reveals persistent health, education, and income disparities.
Although Congress has passed more than 150 statutes to address negative effects of earlier federal actions...
...to provide a process for reorganizing a Native Hawaiian governing entity.
It has been 20 years since the Apology Resolution, but the federal government has not yet acted...
In 1993, the Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Apology Resolution, a formal acknowledgement and apology.
Congress has consistently recognized Native Hawaiians as native peoples on whose behalf it may exercise its powers
Native Hawaiian children were punished for speaking Hawaiian, just as American Indians and Alaska Natives were...
These policies were as harmful and unjust to Native Hawaiians as they were to Alaska Natives and American Indians.
For almost two centuries federal policies of removal, relocation, assimilation &amp; termination decimated Native communities
Native Hawaiians...deserve access to the prevailing federal policy of self-determination.
I chose this day to come to the Floor to talk about an issue of great importance: Native Hawaiian government reorganization.
“Mr. President, June 11th marks a public holiday in the State of Hawaii – King Kamehameha Day...
