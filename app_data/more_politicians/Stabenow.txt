Kavanaugh has a well documented history of decisions that put wealthy special interests before working families. If confirmed, he will double down on and expand the bad Citizen's United decision corrupting our political system.

I expect Judge Kavanaugh to be transparent about his views on the Mueller investigation during his confirmation hearing. Now more than ever, we need assurance that he will allow the investigation to continue no matter where it leads. https://t.co/lmDkd2wkbb
President Trump's bizarre bromance with Vladimir Putin is beyond disturbing. The American President should stand up for America. That should never even be a question. It's more important than ever that we protect the Mueller investigation to ensure our elections are fair.
Today I announced that I would be opposing Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Here's why: https://t.co/jF8N6ClHgk
While all eyes are on the Supreme Court, Senate Rs quietly confirmed Brian Benczkowski to one of the top positions at the Department of Justice. He has real ties to Russia and if Rosenstein is fired, he could be put in charge of the Russia investigation. Watch this closely...
The 2018 Senate Farm Bill reflects Michigan on every page. From the start, I led the effort to ensure the bill will help create jobs, protect the Great Lakes, increase nutrition efforts, and strengthen our rural communities across Michigan.

Despite warnings from her staff, DeVos pushed to reinstate a for-profit accreditor that approved two fraudulent schools that left thousand of students in debt. DeVos clearly has her own agenda and it doesn't involve protecting Michigan students.

Trump's Administration is putting your health care at risk if you have a pre-existing condition. Is this administration really willing to go back to the times when an insurer could refuse to insure you if you were pregnant, diabetic, or had cancer?

Net neutrality protections are officially gone as of today, but it doesn't have to be this way. It's time for House Republicans to join the Senate by standing with consumers and repealing this awful decision. We need to act!

This is an outrageous move by state Republicans. Repealing the prevailing wage hurts our skilled workers and their families, and undermines so many great jobs and apprenticeships. We need to be doing more to promote good-paying jobs in Michigan!

No one should have to fear violence just for pursuing an education. All 20 women in the US Senate are united: #BringBackOurGirls
Students just want a #fairshot. We need to make college more affordable so everyone who wants to go can do so.
.@SenWarren's bill, which I am excited to cosponsor, will allow millions of borrowers to refinance their student loans at much lower rates.
Proud to stand with @SenWarren in the fight to keep college affordable and help the millions of Americans saddled with student debt.
The names of the girls in Nigeria kidnapped for getting an education. We need to get them home. #Bringbackourgirls http://t.co/jo3jUSp5Q1

Great news! Over 270,000 people in Michigan signed up for high-quality, private insurance through the #ACA
Cracking down on other countries’ trade violations is critical to helping our businesses create jobs right here in the U.S.
We need to make sure countries follow trade laws, US businesses and workers can out-compete anyone on a level playing field.
Working families in Michigan want a #fairshot, they don’t want Congress rigging the rules for the big shots.
Send a message to Congress: workers deserve a #fairshot to build a better life for their family http://t.co/BpwoM5gqu1
We remember the Holocaust today, and every day. Never forget and never again. We must fight racism every day #DOR2014

It is long past time to make sure that women have #EqualPay. I hope my colleagues will join me in taking action
I’ll be on with Paul W on @wjrradio this morning discussing critically important mental health legislation and veterans
It’s great to see the West Michigan Whitecaps back in action at Fifth Third Ballpark after last year’s horrible fire!
Women in MI make 74% of what men make doing the same job. Last time I checked, women don’t pay 74% of what men do for groceries. #EqualPay
Today is #EqualPay Day, the day in 2014 when a woman doing the same job finally earns the same amount a man earned in 2013
Congress left people like Josie behind when UI expired in Dec. The Senate voted to #renewUI, the House needs to act. http://t.co/SLUQqACKWw
It took far too long for the Senate to #renewUI. Now the House needs to act immediately to help thousands of Michigan families.
Gender discrimination in pay costs the average Michigan woman and her family $13,125 a year in lost wages. We need to fix that. #EqualPay
In Michigan, on average, women are only paid 74 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as a man. That’s just not right. #equalpay

It’s more critical than ever that we increase access to mental health treatment so our veterans can get the care they need.

I’m glad the Senate came together to make sure vets get their full benefits. I hope we can keep finding bipartisan solutions going forward.
Nelson Mandela was released from prison 24 years ago today. We must never forget his lifelong work for freedom, reconciliation and equality.
It’s outrageous to raise taxes on families to “pay for” vets’ benefits; men and women in uniform have paid in full.
Great to see a company putting the health of their customers first! I hope others will follow their lead.

On his watch, the #Tigers were 3-time AL Central Champs and went to two World Series. Thanks for 8 great years as a Tiger, Jim Leyland.
Need a win tonight. Go #Tigers!
Great game last night, #Tigers! Let’s get one tonight and then close it out in Boston.
I’ll be on the @EdShow in a few minutes. Tune in on MSNBC!
Congratulations to my newest colleague, @CoryBooker! #NJSen
Tough loss last night, but the #Tigers will be roaring back tonight! #ALCS #Detroit
Relieved this shutdown is ending. It should never have happened. Now Congress needs to focus on #jobs and the economy.
Let’s go #Tigers! Time to bounce back at home. #ALCS
As if you need them, here are 14 reasons you should root for the #Tigers (and check out #11!): http://t.co/zyOwoMkOUB
It’s time to #EndThisNow with a bipartisan agreement to open government, pay our bills, and negotiate a budget – like the Senate plan.
Let's go #Tigers! Let's grab another win tonight!
One down, three games to go! Great pitching! #Tigers #BlessYouBoys
These political fights are awful. Thank goodness for the #Tigers. #BlessYouBoys
As always, proud to be a Spartan! Great win over Indiana today. #Spartans
Can’t make it home for this one, but I’m cheering on my #Spartans! #GoGreen
@MichiganRadio Yes! In 2011, even threatening a default added $100/month to new mortgages; cost $800B in retirement savings. #talk2Michigan

Discussed how we can close the skills gap @MottCollege by pairing colleges with local businesses to provide job training #jobs
Talked with business leaders and workers today at @OCCollege about my New Skills for New Jobs Act #jobs
The #GreatLakes are too important - the House GOP plan to slash funding is dangerous for #Michigan. http://t.co/hYwtS6uzBh
#GLRI helps us fight invasive species. House GOP plan to slash $75 million is a big mistake. #GreatLakes http://t.co/hLQjlFLqmf
Since 2010, #GLRI has awarded $112 million to 264 projects in #Michigan to clean up the Great Lakes. A $75 million cut would be disastrous.
We should be doing everything to protect and restore our Great Lakes. Slashing #GLRI would be a huge mistake. http://t.co/IS9ysRdSw3
House GOP is considering a bill that will slash funding for the Great Lakes by $75 million. It would roll out the red carpet for Asian carp.
I’ve made it a priority to bring more Community Health Centers to Michigan so families are able to get the care they need #NHCW2013
It's National Health Center Week, and I thank everyone who is working so hard to bring great health care to our communities! #NHCW2013
Did you know that community health centers serve more than 600,000 people at 220 locations in #Michigan alone? #NHCW2013
In Michigamme today - this is the piano that Jimmy Stewart and Duke Ellington played in "Anatomy of a Murder" http://t.co/To4Ds3Pruc
Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi: "The sequester cuts have weighed heavily on the economy … Real GDP growth came to a virtual standstill"
Steven Rattner: "the GDP data shows clearly that sequestration has significantly reduced economic growth"
Remember "it's the economy, stupid"? Now it's the stupid way sequester makes cuts that's slowing our economy down.
The sequester is a dumb way to make spending cuts. It's costing us middle-class jobs &amp; slowing our economy. Proof in today's #GDP numbers.
Sequestration is making it harder for small biz to get loans, undermining medical innovation &amp; eliminating high-tech defense jobs.
Loud and clear message from economists: the irresponsible sequester cuts are the primary reason the #GDP growth is slow.
Today's GDP numbers make it clear: sequestration is damaging our economy, hurting middle class families, and costing us jobs.

Students across Michigan are saying #DontDoubleMyRate. It’s time for Congress to listen &amp; vote yes on S.1238! http://t.co/8L5pcnflwt
If Congress doesn’t act to keep student loan rates low, #Michigan students will see an increase of almost $1000 per loan. #DontDoubleMyRate
A student loan rate hike would hit almost 300,000 Michigan students. Congress can't let that happen #DontDoubleMyRate http://t.co/7X77LnPMtG
237 years ago, America’s founders put their lives on the line in their fight for freedom. Happy Independence Day!
Students and their families can't afford higher rates -- we need to pass S.1238 to keep rates low! http://t.co/cwqUyzWtiX #DontDoubleMyRate

@nwlc Passing the Paycheck Fairness Act would be a good start to make sure women aren't being kept in the dark about pay gaps. #talkpay

1/3 of the 2013 deficit is from the economic downturn. Creating jobs is critical to reduce the deficit!
Need investments to create jobs and shrink budget deficit to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the competition. Our budget does that!

Let's go #Spartans! #MarchMadness #GoGreen
Good luck to the #Spartans and #Wolverines in Auburn Hills today. Hoping to see them in the finals! #MarchMadness
#RyanBudget hits seniors and middle class. Our budget reduces deficit, grows economy from the middle-out to win in a global economy
Senate Dems #budget creates jobs, grows economy so we can out-educate, out-innovate &amp; out-build the global competition
Can't reduce the deficit with 12 million unemployed; #RyanBudget means even more out of work when we need to create jobs
Under the #RyanBudget, over $30 million for job-creating advanced research in #Michigan would be slashed.
Over 1,000 #Michigan teachers could lose their jobs under the #RyanBudget. Need to invest in education, not slash our children's future.
#Michigan middle-class families would see a $2.4 billion tax hike in #RyanBudget. Senate Budget would prevent that tax hike.
The #RyanBudget would cost #Michigan nearly 60,000 jobs. We can't balance the budget with more people out of work.

In #Michigan, 1,510,033 seniors would be forced out of traditional Medicare and into a new voucher program under the #RyanBudget.
Cuts in #RyanBudget would hurt 465,000 #Michigan seniors who rely on Medicaid for nursing home care. #NotBalanced
#RyanBudget would force 1.2 million #Michigan seniors to pay out-of-pocket for preventive health care. #NotBalanced
Under the #RyanBudget, 106,000 Michigan seniors would pay more for their prescription drugs. #NotBalanced
The #RyanBudget plan would force 1.5 million #Michigan seniors out of traditional Medicare and into a voucher program.

Every minute, there are 24 victims of domestic violence who need our help. It's time Congress reauthorizes #VAWA. Every minute counts.

American businesses &amp; American workers can compete with anybody in the world if we have a level playing field. #BringJobsHome
