We have the best workers in the world in #Ohio, and I’m proud of the workers at Lordstown. They make a great product, and the UAW made concessions there. We have proven ourselves time and again. Let’s put the new product in Lordstown, @GM.
We can and should do more to ensure more cars are made in #Ohio and America, and that’s what the new tax law actually does by incentivizing companies to invest and create jobs here.
In addition, lowering our corporate tax rate to 21% actually makes doing business in the United States far more competitive, especially compared to Mexico’s 30% corporate rate.
This incentive should reduce the tax cost to the investments that would likely need to be made to the plant to bring in a new vehicle there.
Under the tax law, companies making capital expenditures are now able to deduct 100% of the cost of those investments in year one instead of having to follow complicated depreciation schedules over many years.
I’m hopeful that @GM will make a wise decision and utilize the tax law’s benefits of immediate expensing and a lower rate to retool the Lordstown plant and bring a new vehicle there.
We’ve seen countless multinational companies responding to this new level playing field by bringing jobs and investment back into the U.S. in response to the new tax law.
The new tax law was designed to encourage companies to bring back jobs and investment to the U.S. through a competitive corporate rate and our new international tax system &amp; it’s having a positive effect on our economy.
In fact, the opposite is true. Through a lower corporate rate and immediate expensing, the tax bill incentivizes companies to invest in the U.S. and would help GM bring a new vehicle to the Lordstown plant.
I’m disappointed in @GM’s decision to shut down the Lordstown plant because the Chevy Cruze was not selling well. To be clear, this decision has absolutely nothing to do with the new tax law.
Great to sit down with my good friend Senator-elect @MittRomney this afternoon. I’m excited to work with him next year &amp; I know he will make the great state of #Utah proud. https://t.co/koS7AsZFkc

When I was elected to the Senate, Senator McCain would jokingly introduce me to reporters as “the jerk who played Obama.” I was proud to honor my friend &amp; colleague on the @SenateFloor this afternoon. Here is my full tribute: https://t.co/hT5QkdUxGs
During @SenJohnMcCain '08 presidential campaign, I served as a stand in for then-Senator Obama in debate prep. It was my job help him prepare &amp; get under his skin, and I did. Needless to say, he wasn’t happy with me during those debate sessions. https://t.co/hT5QkdUxGs
A @Navy Captain, Congressman, &amp; U.S. Senator, @SenJohnMcCain was first and foremost a patriot. Throughout his whole life—and very prolific life—he lived the motto of his 2008 presidential campaign, which was simply, ‘Country first.’ https://t.co/hT5Qkec8y0

20 years ago the American people had lost faith in the #IRS &amp; sweeping changes were needed to get the agency back on track. In my @CNBC op-ed, I lay out why it’s time to reform the #IRS once again. https://t.co/RkIG5py3yt
In an op-ed for @CNBC that I co-wrote w/ former Senator Bob Kerrey we discuss why the time is now for #IRS reform in order to help make the agency more responsive &amp; accountable to taxpayers. https://t.co/RkIG5py3yt

Yesterday, @POTUS signed the FY19 #NDAA into law. It includes significant funding I worked to secure for defense installations in #Ohio including upgrades of Abram tanks &amp;Stryker Vehicles at the JSMC in Lima. More from @limanews on how this funding is used https://t.co/sfrkHIgYcp
More good news on how #taxreform is benefitting our economy: “Small business owners’ optimism touched a 35-year high in July, with businesses setting records in terms of job creation and hiring” https://t.co/IEAsg9qG1n #jobs #Ohio
I’ve worked to help Paint Valley #ADAMH by delivering additional opioid funding to their counties through the #CURES law enacted in 2016.  Good story here about how Paint Valley will be able to use their $573K in funding to combat the #opioidepidemic https://t.co/N1qF1nqkCg
I was proud to secure opioid funding in the 2016 #CURES legislation and I’ve seen firsthand how it is benefiting #Ohio. For the 2nd year in a row, #Ohio has received $26 million in funding to combat the #opioidcrisis. https://t.co/bNy01GAsPA
Judge #Kavanaugh is a dedicated public servant who has chosen to spend the last 25 of his 28-year career serving the American people in various jobs. He has the experience &amp; qualifications to serve on #SCOTUS, but most importantly to me, he’s a good person https://t.co/vXBISWdl46
Cyberattacks are a real &amp; serious threat to our country. We must address this type of warfare head-on. That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation that will establish permanent Cyber response teams at @DHSgov. https://t.co/nifeVoEHH8
I’ve worked to help Lorain County by delivering additional opioid funding to this community through the #CURES law enacted in 2016.  Good story here about how Lorain County will benefit from this funding to help combat the #opioidcrisis: https://t.co/zSKFFQvhfe
Later today, @POTUS will sign the FY 2019 #NDAA into law. This defense law provides needed resources to rebuild our military, to support our soldiers &amp; to provide upgrades &amp; support to #Ohio’s defense installations. https://t.co/jBF3NiYQhK
I have known Judge #Kavanaugh for 15+ years. He has an impressive background and is widely respected in the legal community, but just as important is he is a good person with compassion &amp; humility. There is no one who is more qualified to serve on #SCOTUS https://t.co/pmRFKT33u9
Protecting our #GreatLakes is a critical priority for me. I was glad that the #Senate passed bipartisan legislation last week to provide the $300 million I fought for to fully fund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which will help protect both our environment &amp; economy
Last week I wrote an op-ed outlining the dire impact the #opioidcrisis is having on our country’s workforce, and the need for businesses to step up to help combat this epidemic. Read the entire @PlainDealer piece here: https://t.co/4zVwSgmYt6
Every year, millions of people visit our #NationalParks and over time trails, bridges, buildings, water systems &amp; roads have started to deteriorate. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help address the $12b backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects in our #NationalParks
A few flakes of #fentanyl can kill a person. Right now synthetic drugs like #fentanyl are being shipped across our border via our own Postal Service. It’s outrageous, and my #STOPAct will help put an end to this. The Senate must pass this bill. https://t.co/8QsP3b2EyQ
Across #Ohio, over 140,000 jobs are open but many require skills employers can’t find. We need to bridge the skills gap! I’m pleased @POTUS signed my bipartisan Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act into law. It will improve the quality of #CTE programs &amp; help kids fill that gap
Americans work hard every day to provide for themselves &amp; their families. That’s why I introduced the bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act to reform the #IRS and make it more responsive &amp; accountable to the American people. https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8
Judge #Kavanaugh is a man with great compassion, humility, and a big heart. He has the experience, qualifications and background to serve admirably on #SCOTUS and I look forward to voting to confirm his nomination. https://t.co/6WOtmuzxd8
My bipartisan #SESTA law is already making a real difference in combatting online sex trafficking and protecting women &amp; children, by resulting in the shutdown of several websites that knowingly facilitated sex trafficking. https://t.co/Zcy2OOK2DV
Cyberattacks hurt us all &amp; quick response teams help federal agencies, critical infrastructure &amp; key private sector partners respond to attacks. I introduced the bipartisan DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams Act to bolster cybersecurity at @DHSgov https://t.co/AXNAGorReb
I recently participated in a roundtable in #Whitehall to see firsthand how new grant funding awarded thru my  #CARA law is being used in innovative &amp; effective ways to help combat the #opioidepidemic gripping the nation, especially in #Ohio #STOPAct #CARA2 https://t.co/OpDr0RrJvI
I recently visited @CVNPNPS where, like many of our #NationalParks, we have backlog of maintenance projects that must be fixed or we risk losing the majesty of the Parks to wear &amp; tear. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will #FixOurParks &amp; preserve them for generations to come.
After years of stagnant growth &amp; flat wages, the pro-growth policies we have passed like #taxreform &amp; regulatory reform are growing the economy, creating more #jobs, increasing wages, &amp; expanding opportunity. Read more in my recent @TroyDailyNews op-ed: https://t.co/n2kMJo0qza
Many Americans have had to struggle w/ the unresponsiveness of the #IRS. Taxpayers deserve to have a responsive &amp; accountable #IRS. My bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will restructure &amp; reform the #IRS &amp; help restore America’s faith in the agency. https://t.co/HPdfaO2kHG
According to @MissingKids, “Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children previously have been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down.” I'm glad to see my bipartisan #SESTA law which is already making a difference. https://t.co/uG2g5iqkhn
I commend the @StateDept for its increased sanctions on #Russia in response to its use of a nerve agent on a #UK citizen on #UK soil. We must do more to hold Russia accountable for its efforts to undermine our democratic institutions and values. https://t.co/wthEpsoIlk
34 former law clerks to Judge #Kavanaugh – among them Republicans, Democrats &amp; Independents – strongly endorse his #SCOTUS nomination in this letter.  A wonderful tribute to a judge of great compassion &amp; character.  https://t.co/2NHVN4aRhP
#Ohio has received $26 million in #CURES funding I fought for to combat the #opioidcrisis. A positive step forward but we must do more. That’s why I continue to push for common-sense solutions like my #STOPAct &amp; #CARA2 that will help stop this epidemic https://t.co/t9Tt7vIvHs
Section 232 is a powerful trade tool used in matters of national security, but its misuse could result in loss of the tool or repercussions from other countries. My bipartisan Trade Security Act aims to reform 232 so it's used in the way it was intended &amp; US #jobs are protected.
Protecting the #GreatLakes is a vital priority of mine. #LakeErie is incredibly important to #Ohio’s economy &amp; ecology. I continue to work to fully fund the bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to ensure our lakes are protected &amp; preserved. https://t.co/wJ8bhzA8pQ
.@POTUS has signed my bipartisan Educating Tomorrow’s Workforce Act into law. Great news for #Ohio! Students will now have access to higher quality Career &amp; Technical Education to better prepare them for #jobs in today’s in-demand skills-based careers https://t.co/ybxDFIFeqJ

Thanks to my #SESTA law, victims &amp; families of online sex trafficking are finally able to get their day in court &amp; receive the justice the deserve. Sites that knowingly facilitated online trafficking are being shut down &amp; this is terrific news! https://t.co/uG2g5iHVFX
I welcomed the @StateDept announcement yesterday that new sanctions will be imposed on #Russia in response to the determination that the #Russian govt used a nerve agent on a #UK citizen on #UK soil. We must continue to hold #Russia accountable for their destabilizing behavior.
Recently I spoke on the @SenateFloor about #SCOTUS nominee Judge #Kavanaugh. A man of great character &amp; integrity, he has the experience &amp; qualifications to ably serve on the highest court in the land &amp; I strongly support his nomination. https://t.co/EM2RHbIa7B
Our economy is growing &amp; businesses are expanding but unfortunately the #opioidcrisis has depleted the pool of workers in #Ohio. In the @PlainDealer I highlight how employers have a responsibility to step up &amp; do more to help #Congress combat this crisis. https://t.co/xQxNinTHzc

#TaxReform has spurred economic growth&amp; is creating more #jobs, higher wages &amp; more opportunities for biz &amp; workers. An #Ohio family of 4 w/ a median income could see an avg tax cut of about $2000 a year! More on how #taxreform is working in @TroyDailyNews https://t.co/n2kMJoi1qI
Too often the federal government is not responsive to the needs of the people, &amp; the IRS has not always served the interest of the taxpayer. My bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will make the IRS more responsive &amp; accountable to taxpayers. https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8

It is vital to have a justice on #SCOTUS who has exceptional credentials and experience, but just as important, a good &amp; compassionate person. After knowing him for 15+ years, I can say that Judge #Kavanaugh is that person. https://t.co/umQSvmhTLY
We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable but it’s important that we do so in a way that protects #jobs here. My Trade Security Act will reform Section 232 so that it can only be used in matters of national security as it was intended. https://t.co/HAlOjnAhIu

Judge #Kavanaugh is known for fairly and impartially applying the law &amp; the Constitution rather than legislating from the bench and most importantly, he’s a good, compassionate man with great character. He is a terrific choice for #SCOTUS &amp; I strongly support his confirmation. https://t.co/JUpyQlDwg8

Proud to participate in the ribbon cutting for the new firing ranges at  @910AW this morning. I pushed to secure funding in the 2016 #NDAA to ensure that our #Youngstown reservists have the training they need to carry out their operations. https://t.co/U0Cc1awAlU
Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor honoring two brave Capitol Police Officers, Jacob Chestnut &amp; Detective John Gibson, who gave their lives in the line of duty when a gunman opened fire in the US Capitol 20 years ago. May their heroic efforts never be forgotten. https://t.co/G9GgBOhFZ0

My bipartisan #CTE bill passed the #House yesterday and is now on the way to @POTUS to be signed into law. This legislation will help students get the career &amp; technical education they need, regardless of economic standing, to pursue their American dream. https://t.co/z9rVCMFbOS
It has been 20 years since the last significant #IRS reform, and it is time to update the agency once again. The bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will restructure &amp; reform the #IRS to make it more responsive &amp; accountable to the needs of taxpayers https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8
Too often, the federal government isn’t responsive to the needs of the people it serves, and the #IRS has not always served the interests of taxpayers. That’s why I introduced the Protecting Taxpayers Act today to reform the #IRS https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8
This morning, I will chair an @GOPSenFinance subcmte hearing on #IRS reform solutions. Proud to intro legislation with my colleague @SenatorCardin today to make the #IRS more responsive &amp; accountable to taxpayers https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8
This afternoon at a #Senate Foreign Relations hearing, I pressed Secretary Pompeo on imposing additional sanctions on #Russia and urged him to maintain those strict sanctions as long as #Russia continues to illegally occupy #Ukraine. https://t.co/t3OIRtDlk6

25 IG Reports reviewed by the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, found more than half of the data submitted to https://t.co/UMjVr23JIA from fed. agencies – about $240 bill in spending – was inaccurate. This is unacceptable: https://t.co/vII0SAJof2
In the @highlandcopress I discuss how Judge #Kavanaugh is a legal scholar who respects the Constitution and won’t legislate from the bench. He’s a good man and who should be confirmed for #SCOTUS to address issues that affect #Ohioans &amp; Americans. https://t.co/qVRca9Vlkl
On @MSNBC earlier today I discussed my bipartisan #SESTA law that helps ensure justice for victims of online sex trafficking. Contrary to claims by some, selling women &amp; children online is not constitutionally protected speech. https://t.co/8b3OgY3m8v

As Judge #Kavanaugh's Harvard Law students will tell you, his loyalty lies w/ the Constitution. He interprets the law &amp; Constitution  without imposing his own point of view. More in my op-ed for @TheDailyCall: https://t.co/YsTGSohKea
I recently met with Judge #Kavanaugh and saw the compassion, humility, big heart &amp; readiness to serve of the friend I’ve known for 15+ years. I can’t imagine a more qualified nominee for #SCOTUS. https://t.co/srT0SgQXiI
The #Senate passed my bipartisan bill to strengthen career &amp; technical education earlier today. This bill will help #Ohioans get the training they need for today’s jobs, regardless of economic standing https://t.co/N6onjz251M
I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into https://t.co/UMjVr23JIA to date, but we must continue to hold agencies accountable for providing accurate spending data.  More on my bipartisan report here: https://t.co/SFHBa4jkGy
A functioning https://t.co/UMjVr23JIA will improve transparency &amp; help policymakers identify &amp; eliminate gov. waste. My report today outlines recs to improve data submissions by federal agencies &amp; give policymakers &amp; the public the information they deserve https://t.co/vII0SAJof2

It’s a fact: Judge #Kavanaugh is an immensely qualified, highly respected judge &amp; most importantly, he’s a good man with a big heart. He is the right nominee for #SCOTUS and I’m proud to support his confirmation. https://t.co/f4Nky6Hkgx
Earlier this week the Department of @ENERGY transferred 80 acres of land to the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative in #Piketon. This will encourage development and have a positive economic impact on the region.
According to @MissingKids a leading national antitrafficking group: Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children previously had been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down. Good news that demonstrates how my bipartisan #SESTA is working to help end human trafficking

A few flakes of #fentanyl can kill a person; unfortunately accidental overdoses are at an all time high. I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my bipartisan #STOPAct which will gives law enforcement the tools they need to help stop the influx of this poison in our communities
According to @MissingKids, a leading anti-trafficking group in the country, “there has been a major disruption in the online marketplace” since #SESTA was enacted &amp; “it is much harder to purchase a child online.” That’s great news. And that’s exactly what we intended #SESTA to do
Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor in order to provide an update on my bipartisan #SESTA law. #SESTA is already making a difference in reducing online sex trafficking, and multiple known websites that facilitated trafficking have been shut down! https://t.co/Bpu4nwDP9p

Yesterday @POTUS signed the National Vets Memorial &amp;Museum Act into law designating the National Vets Memorial &amp;Museum in #Columbus #Ohio. Im grateful for the services &amp;sacrifices of our vets &amp; I’m proud that #Columbus #Ohio is home to this important venue https://t.co/KKokenXmHj
As my Permanent Subcmte on Investigations report showed, @HHS &amp; @DHS are not equipped to handle this influx of unaccompanied minors. Congress must act to protect these children &amp; ensure they show up to their immigration hearings. See the report here: https://t.co/MUwtpfjhqT
We can keep families together &amp;have strong border security. On the @SenateFloor I highlighted the Keep Families Together &amp;Enforce the Law Act &amp;urged Congress to work together to find a compassionate solution that also upholds our country’s immigration laws https://t.co/NnzyNWH5Tp
Pleased that @HHSgov released a study on the levels of certain toxic chemicals that are safe for exposure. @EPAGov had been blocking HHS from releasing the study &amp; I wrote a letter along w/ a bipartisan group of 10 colleagues urging the admin to release it https://t.co/4RncAupjXQ
Great news out of #MingoJunction #Ohio where @jswsteel has chosen to invest in a steel manufacturing facility. The steel industry is a huge part of #Ohio &amp;will continue to be for many years.  Excited for the #jobs &amp; economic boost this will give the region https://t.co/31HgiroC6J
I co-wrote an op-ed w/ @RepMikeBishop for @detroitnews about the need for Senate to pass my bipartisan #STOPAct. We need the #STOPAct b/c fentanyl has invaded our communities, is increasingly robbing people of their God-given potential &amp; taking lives https://t.co/myIzZ2YL4J
According to an #Ohio Chamber of Commerce survey from May: 70% of businesses added employees in the first 3 months of the year and 75% said they plan to hire this quarter. And that’s just one benefit of #taxreform: https://t.co/6hiNxfg9CP #jobs #Ohio
We can have strong border security w/out separating families. That’s why I joined my colleagues in introducing the Keep Families Together &amp; Enforce the Law Act. This bill ensures families are kept together during their immigration enforcement proceedings https://t.co/jgrJSZ9nX8
In today’s @axios &amp; per new @avalerehealth study, states that limit #opioidRXs have an above average drop in #opioid sales. My bipartisan #CARA2 would limit #opioidRXs for acute pain to just 3 days in order to help combat #opioidaddiction nationwide https://t.co/ZMHAh3cqx8

At today’s @GOPSenateFinance hrg with the Commerce Secy, I urged a different approach on trade &amp; cautioned against using Section 232 to enforce trade infractions. 232 is used in conditions of national security &amp; its misuse could lead to #tradewars https://t.co/xqQnjtEEXE #Jobs
Last week @GOPSenateFinance passed my bipartisan #CRIBAct out of committee.  Now the full Senate must pass the bill so that newborns born dependent on drugs, like #opioids, can receive the quality care they deserve. https://t.co/FAgc5qvrdl

Today marks one year since Otto Warmbier passed away, another reminder of the evil nature of the North Korean regime. Jane and my thoughts are with Fred, Cindy, and the entire Warmbier family who have been remarkably strong throughout this ordeal.
The admin should change course immediately and keep families together while their cases are expedited.  If they don’t, Congress should act quickly on a legislative solution and I’m working with my colleagues to do so. https://t.co/tvbLj0UsgL
Based on my Senate PSI investigation, we know that HHS and DHS are not prepared to effectively deal with even more unaccompanied minors. https://t.co/tvbLj1c3Fl. See more on our oversight efforts here: https://t.co/qJzu4oKFuY
As I have said consistently, including to @WLWT last week, I oppose the administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border. We can have strong border security without separating families. https://t.co/PEb2Qt7klb. More here: https://t.co/tvbLj1c3Fl
Here is my statement reiterating my opposition to the Trump admin policy of separating families at the border. https://t.co/68xivO7zr6

I was pleased that the Senate passed the FY 2019 #NDAA which will help support our troops and increase their well-deserved pay. I am particularly pleased that several of my key initiatives were included which will benefit #Ohio’s defense installations. https://t.co/yNuj9BWpeK
The Permanent Subcmte on Investigations which I chair released results of an investigation of #IranDeal showing the Obama admin misled the American people by issuing a special license that would allow Iran to convert assets using the US Financial System https://t.co/aK9Bw4SbYi
Unlike illegal drugs that are smuggled over land, most illegal fentanyl is manufactured &amp; shipped from labs in #China to the US via our own Postal System. I co-wrote an op-ed w/ @RepMikeBishop for @detroitnews about how my #STOPAct will help combat this https://t.co/myIzZ3gmtj
Strong momentum behind the bipartisan #STOPAct to help combat the #opioidcrisis. House passed it last week. Making progress in the Senate &amp; the @washingtonpost ed board now supports the bill. “Opioids Come From China in the US Mail. Here’s How to Stop it.” https://t.co/GP2E8oMp5C

#Opioidaddiction is unfortunately at an all-time high across #Ohio &amp; in our nation. My bipartisan #CARA2 will limit RXs for opioid to 3 days for acute pain to help reduce the number of people who become addicted to #opioids &amp; help end the #opioidcrisis https://t.co/dEHOzcDQrC
Thank to my bipartisan #CARA legislation, we’re getting more resources to our first responders across the country and especially in #Ohio to combat the #opioidepidemic. My #CARA2 will increase funding for first responders and make more progress in ending the #opioidcrisis.
Because of our old, broken tax code, @honeywell @Intelligrated in #Mason #Ohio were forced to keep many profits overseas. Thanks to #taxreform, they are now bringing $7 billion back to the US to help reinvest in their business &amp; their employees! https://t.co/uJtgDwvIYi
We’re getting closer to getting my #STOPAct signed into law, which will help combat this #opioidepidemic.  Passed the House last week &amp; now making progress in the #Senate. This bill will make a big difference for #Ohio https://t.co/P5RWabAlfJ.
I spoke on the @SenateFloor earlier this week about my bipartisan #STOPAct. A few flakes of the synthetic drug fentanyl can easily cause an overdose and this poison is coming into our communities in record numbers through our US mail. It must be stopped. https://t.co/xkjBVYtNPX
Earlier this week the @GOPSenFinance passed the #CRIBAct, which will allow newborns born dependent on #opioids to get the quality care they need. I’m now pushing the full #Senate to pass this bill so we can work to get it signed into law. https://t.co/HDQ4Zenped

As a result of #taxreform, biz like @Honeywell @Intelligrated are able to bring back $$ to the US that was overseas b/c of the old international tax rate. This means more money for @Intelligrated to expand, hire more workers, &amp; increase retirement benefits for employees #jobs
Today I visited @Honeywell @intelligrated in #Mason #Ohio for my 19th official stop in my Results for the Middle Class Tax Reform Tour. Thanks to #taxreform  Honeywell will be bringing $7 bill from overseas in the next 2 years to expand biz and reinvest in their workers! https://t.co/ryuaFiRUrl

The only reason #Iran was not able to convert their assets using our financial system was because the 2 U.S. banks stood up to the Obama administration and refused to complete the transaction after they were asked to do so. https://t.co/ORloOQjXjL
Last week the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations that I chair unveiled a report showing the Obama admin. misled the American people by granting a special license to #Iran to convert billions of $$ using the US financial system, after multiple assurances that would never happen.

Following this summit I remain skeptical but hopeful that this new dialogue can translate into meaningful progress. #POTUS’ maximum pressure campaign must remain in place until #NorthKorea truly changes course &amp; ends its dangerous nuclear weapons program.
For nearly 18 months I worked to help secure the release of Otto Warmbier. Nearly one year ago, I joined Fred and Cindy Warmbier in #Cincinnati as they welcomed Otto home from #NorthKorea, and it’s a constant reminder to me about the evil nature of this regime.
I am hopeful that the negotiations can achieve these goals. In the past, however, #NorthKorea has used talks to stall while continuing its nuclear and missile programs.  Empty promises cannot buy any more time.
I have long called for a direct dialogue between the U.S. &amp; #NorthKorea, and I have supported this summit with the goal of achieving a peaceful solution that includes North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.
I’m urging the administration, along with a bipartisan group of 10 Senators, to release an @HHSGov study regarding what levels of certain chemicals are safe in drinking water. The @EPA is blocking the release of the results &amp; Americans deserve to know https://t.co/qHDTUyov6V

There is a reason Barbara Bush was one of the most popular people in America. She was dignified, straightforward, and funny, and always well intentioned. She spoke her mind freely, and when she did most of us nodded our heads in agreement https://t.co/NF2TwexchS
One of only two women in history who was both First Lady and the mother of a president, Barbara Bush used her influence to help others, including  empowering people through literacy. https://t.co/NF2TweONGs

We’ve waited for this day a long time and a mini-blizzard of snow is not going to stop the U.S. Senate from passing #SESTA today.
The Sacremento court opinion called for changes to #CDA230 like those in #SESTA to ensure justice for victims of online sex trafficking. This is why we must pass #SESTA. To ensure justice. https://t.co/1agTJgoqSX
Last year, a Sacramento judge cited the broad immunity provided by the Communications Decency Act in dismissing  charges against Backpage. We must act to give these victims the justice they deserve. https://t.co/1agTJgG2hx #SESTA

Justice cannot be seen but its absence can be felt. And that’s what’s happening now, an absence of justice. #SESTA is the online sex trafficking solution victims and their families need and courts have called for https://t.co/FjfWkzuqpN

Yesterday's indictment of 13 Russian nationals &amp; three Russian entities for interfering in the 2016 presidential election was a positive step toward holding #Russia accountable. The American people deserve answers.
#Russia has been attempting to undermine our democracy for decades. And they will continue to do so. We must not lose sight of the bigger picture, &amp; take serious steps to combat their propaganda and disinformation campaigns.
The #STOPAct is a no-brainer to help keep these drugs out of our communities. Congress must act: https://t.co/7ZrfqtkHfd
Congress must act to close the loophole that lets drug traffickers exploit the Postal Service to send deadly drugs like fentanyl from #China to the U.S.: https://t.co/T4Jy93FGei
#TaxReform is creating more opportunities for families in Marietta and across #Ohio. My latest op-ed via @MariettaTimes: https://t.co/McOo9pe8sM
The negative impact on our economy, on #jobs &amp; our workers of having profits locked out of the U.S. makes no sense &amp; is why I fought to reform our international tax code. This announcement by @Cisco &amp; others is one of many indicators that #taxreform is working as intended
We must not forget that this is one small part of the larger process of understanding the extent of ongoing Russian disinformation &amp; influence operations against the United States and our allies. We must do more to counter foreign propaganda &amp; disinfo from #Russia &amp; others.
I’ve long said that the issue of Russian meddling in our presidential election must be investigated fully, and that the Special Counsel should follow the facts wherever they lead because the American people deserve to see all the facts. https://t.co/pzLZbQ0Lhq

Despite the Senate’s failure to make progress today, we still have a responsibility to act. We must protect those covered by #DACA &amp; provide for border security. This should be done on a bipartisan basis: https://t.co/7GFQnR6Cu2
Our proposal will provide a permanent solution to protect the #DACA population while also putting in place stronger border security measures: https://t.co/7GFQnR6Cu2
Today, w/ @SenJohnThune &amp; @JerryMoran, I introduced legislation to codify protections for the #DACA population &amp; to strengthen border security for all Americans. https://t.co/7GFQnR6Cu2

Pleased @POTUS has proposed increasing funding to upgrade Abrams tanks. Produced at the JSMC in Lima, this funding will help ensure that our forward deployed tanks have the most cutting-edge capabilities: https://t.co/CnWlQIG9y9
The Pentagon’s latest National Defense Strategy highlights the harsh realities of the threats we face in the world &amp; the steps we need to take to confront them. We must invest in our men &amp; women in uniform and give them the tools they need now and in the future to do their jobs.
Pleased the president's budget proposes additional funding for Camp Ravenna and the @OHNationalGuard soldiers that train there: https://t.co/byD6UXWXlS

The Great Lakes are an invaluable resource to #Ohio, &amp; the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a successful public-private partnership that helps protect both our environment and our economy. https://t.co/L02SPprKmS
I am also glad to see the administration is making permitting reform a priority. Will help put more people back to work, improve our infrastructure, &amp; better protect the environment. https://t.co/gAaEFrwl8O #infrastructure #jobs
By rebuilding our aging #infrastructure and improving job training programs targeted toward in-demand infrastructure-related #jobs, we have a great opportunity to further strengthen our economy.

#NorthKorea is a vicious, brutal regime that systematically abuses the natural rights of its own citizens. It survives on total repression, fear &amp; propaganda. NK must be called out for what it is, and the West must not legitimize those who enable &amp; benefit from this cruel regime.
Thank you to the Warmbier family for reminding us of the brutality of the North Korean regime. https://t.co/AfibQQ3c7a
On Friday, the president signed into law legislation that provides $6 billion in funding over 2 years to help tackle the #opioidcrisis. This is a positive step, but more must be done: https://t.co/gQOIVoU3Wf
The #opioidcrisis is having a devastating impact on #Ohio communities, families, local budgets, the criminal justice system &amp; more. We must take a more aggressive role at the national level to help turn the tide.

There is clearly a legislative solution to keep fentanyl out of our communities. That is why I am urging the Senate to pass the #STOPAct: https://t.co/IfBXHeWhkp
Congress must act to defend U.S. businesses and counter efforts by international organizations like the UN to marginalize and discriminate against our ally #Israel. https://t.co/0WEruQMpES

The #opioidcrisis has unfolded in 3 different waves. First came the prescription drug epidemic, then came heroin, &amp; now synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The results have been deadly: https://t.co/jgtvk81Kbg

Jane and I were on the train this morning traveling to the House and Senate Republican Member retreat. We are both fine. We are keeping those who were injured in our prayers and are grateful for the first responders who quickly arrived on the scene.
Drug overdoses are now the number one cause of death, not just accidental death, for Americans under the age of 50. The reason? The spread of heroin &amp; prescription drugs, and now synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil. https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
In case you missed it, here is my response to last night’s State of the Union address. #SOTU https://t.co/46TGzM25Uy
As POTUS mentioned in his #SOTU speech, we are already seeing the benefits of regulatory relief &amp; the new #taxreform law. We know that more must be done. #Jobs
#POTUS tonight talked about the need to strengthen our job training programs and help those re-entering society from prison get a second chance. My #SecondChance Act will help. https://t.co/OaYlyKTd0M
I am hopeful about POTUS' message re: the #opioidepidemic. This is a crisis in #Ohio &amp; around the country. We must do more to keep drugs out of the U.S. &amp; get people the help they need. #SOTU https://t.co/tOH99MQZeA
Infrastructure permitting reform is important to creating #jobs. Glad to see #POTUS discussing its importance. We’re making progress on this through my 2015 bill to make permitting smarter &amp; more efficient.

There is a clear need for a legislative solution to help prevent fentanyl from entering our country through our own mail system. Urging my colleagues to pass the bipartisan #STOPAct: https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
There are now 174 Americans dying every day from drug overdoses. Up from 143 people in 2016 and 105 in 2010. Fentanyl is now the number one killer. We must do more to keep this deadly drug out of the U.S.: https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
On the Senate floor today, I highlighted the bipartisan and eye-opening PSI report that details how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to ship fentanyl into the U.S.: https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
Despite #NAFTA's benefits, we can do better. Modernizing NAFTA to increase market access, expand exports, and include new provisions on intellectual property and e-commerce will help #Ohio workers: https://t.co/7INPqfYvdh

One step that must be taken is to shore up our defenses against drugs coming in through the U.S. mail system. We must do more to keep fentanyl out. #opioidcrisis https://t.co/Saco3QjqPC
The #opioidcrisis and the uptick in #humantrafficking are directly related. It will take a societal effort to help turn the tide of addiction and #endhumantrafficking, but the gov't has a role to play.
The @GLFOP &amp; @FOPofOhio's support for #SESTA &amp; their work to combat #humantrafficking is critical to helping end this heinous crime. https://t.co/mQEKVYKqph

Keeping fentanyl out of our communities is a matter of life and death. Just in the past week, near Toledo, five individuals overdosed and three died. Congress must pass the #STOPAct. https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h
How many more Americans have to die from fentanyl being shipped to drug  traffickers here in the U.S. before Congress acts to help keep these drugs out? https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h #opioidcrisis
Drug traffickers are receiving fentanyl at their front doorsteps, delivered to them by the U.S. mail system via China, with deadly results. https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h #opioidcrisis
The 500 payments we tracked accounted for $766 million in street value, 7 tragic deaths, including a 49 y/o Ohio man, and 6 online sellers all from the same country: China. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
Ordering fentanyl online was as easy as buying any other product online. We  identified more than 500 payments to online sellers by more than 300 Americans totaling $230,000, most of which occurred over the last two years. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
With a simple Google search, we discovered that it was shockingly easy to  get fentanyl. What’s more, we found out we could get it delivered,  through the U.S. mail,  right to our doorstep. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
In #Ohio, fentanyl &amp; its variations were involved in almost 60 percent of all overdose deaths in 2016. So @SenatorCarper &amp; I decided to dig deeper into the source of this deadly drug. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
Yesterday, @CBSThisMorning highlighted our report showing why Congress must act to keep fentanyl out of our communities. #STOPAct #opioidcrisis https://t.co/5oxRMmSRoj
Here’s a look at just some of the coverage on our bipartisan report:  https://t.co/MIWCDJg5Ht #opioidcrisis
In the stunning report I published w/ @SenatorCarper, we show how drug traffickers are exploiting our own mail system, with deadly results. https://t.co/ex5TkWNCrG

The American people deserve a thoughtful, nonpartisan report on Russia’s interference in our election. Must follow the facts wherever they lead: https://t.co/AHNxFWxPmY
The #opioidcrisis is being made worse because drugs are being shipped from China to drug traffickers here in the U.S. through our own mail system. Congress must act: https://t.co/oAcC8glxpW
The #opioidcrisis is getting worse, not better. On @CNN w/ @jaketapper, I discussed how Congress can act to help keep deadly drugs like fentanyl out of our communities: https://t.co/iLn5lwR20l
Will be live on @CNN with @jaketapper shortly. Talking today’s hearing on fentanyl &amp; the #opioidcrisis and more. https://t.co/nK1CbHsMUB
Thank you, Jonathan, for your service to our state &amp; our country. https://t.co/leTAqobmOJ
The vast majority of illegal fentanyl is purchased online from labs in China &amp; then shipped to the United States through the mail. Congress must pass the #STOPAct: https://t.co/jJ02eVjnRP #opioidcrisis
To watch my opening statement at the bipartisan hearing Combatting the #OpioidCrisis: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in International Mail, go here: https://t.co/jJ02eVjnRP
No more Americans should have to die before the federal gov’t gets its act together to help keep deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl out of our communities. https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h #opioidcrisis
Our bipartisan hearing on “Combatting the #OpioidCrisis: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in International Mail” starts at 10am. You can watch live here: https://t.co/tZdPDFCNFa
My yearlong, bipartisan investigation w/ @SenatorCarper culminated in a report showing how fentanyl is shipped from China to drug traffickers here in the U.S., with deadly results. You can read the report here: https://t.co/ex5TkX5dje #opioidcrisis
Drug traffickers from China are exploiting vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship deadly drugs like fentanyl into the U.S. This must stop. #opioidcrisis https://t.co/sJvVX3yoQU
.@CBSThisMorning highlighted my PSI investigation into the #opioidcrisis &amp; Chinese drug traffickers shipping fentanyl through the U.S. Mail: https://t.co/3NwD172xVP
Tomorrow, @SenatorCarper &amp; I will hold a hearing to reveal the details of our bipartisan investigation &amp; discuss policy recommendations resulting from our findings. Tune in tomorrow at 10am: https://t.co/tZdPDFCNFa #opioidcrisis
The federal government can, and must, act to shore up our defenses against this deadly drug and help save lives. Read our full report here: https://t.co/ex5TkWNCrG #opioidcrisis
Thanks to our bipartisan investigation, we now know the depth to which drug traffickers exploit our mail system to ship fentanyl &amp; other synthetic drugs into the U.S. from countries like China. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
Fentanyl is so powerful that just a few flakes of it can kill you, and those who use it not only put themselves in danger, but they also put law enforcement &amp; children at risk. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
In my home state of #Ohio, fentanyl is now the number one killer, surpassing heroin, prescription drugs, &amp; car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0
Today, @SenatorCarper &amp; I released a stunning bipartisan report showing how drug traffickers exploit the international mail system to ship illegal opioids into the U.S. Read it here: https://t.co/ex5TkWNCrG

The #CHIP extension provides much needed certainty and stability to the #Ohio families who rely on it. Proud to support this long-term solution to fund children’s health care: https://t.co/QtgthYRKQN
The 6 year #CHIP extension signed into law last year is the longest extension of CHIP ever authorized. Great news for the families of 8.9 million American children &amp; 219,000 #Ohio children. https://t.co/QtgthYRKQN
On behalf of the Senate, I was proud to sign the bill to renew the #CHIP program for 6 years &amp; fund the government. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump - it's headed to you for signature! https://t.co/81Y3DdUK0z
Also as a result of #taxreform, the median-income family in #Ohio can expect to save about $2,000 a year as a result of these tax cuts. https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
Extending #CHIP for 6 years delivers long-term stability and certainty that families of 219,000 kids in #Ohio &amp; nearly 9 million nationwide deserve: https://t.co/G2mQHbFHwT
Critically, this bill provides a long-term funding solution for #CHIP. This six-year CHIP extension is the longest since the program was enacted more than 20 years ago. https://t.co/G2mQHbFHwT #Ohio
Gov’t shutdowns ultimately hurt our economy, hurt families, and hurt our troops. Pleased that a sufficient number of my Democratic colleagues joined Republicans in voting to re-open the federal gov’t today. #Ohio
One result of #taxreform is that more than 3 million Americans who have federal income tax liability will come off the tax rolls altogether. https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
In businesses in Youngstown and across #Ohio, we are already seeing the benefit of historic #taxreform: https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD

Check out this op-ed by @RameshPonnuru on why the Senate should pass my End Government Shutdowns Act: https://t.co/iQe4Lwuxgk
The past three days are proof of why government shutdowns must end. They help nobody. That is why I have introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act: https://t.co/Nf2PuA13sw
I’m pleased that Senate Democrats are working w/ Republicans to re-open the federal government. Shutdowns are unnecessary, counter-productive, &amp; often end up costing more taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/xPQLKjCP4U
Let’s re-open the government and let’s get back to work. My floor speech tonight: 
https://t.co/LdGti77ewG
The Senate vote tonight will reauthorize #CHIP to help nine million children who need basic health care services, including 219,000 Ohio children. Let’s pass this bill. 
https://t.co/LdGti7oPoe
This shutdown will hurt our economy, our families &amp; our troops. Urged my Democratic colleagues tonight to re-open the federal gov’t.
https://t.co/LdGti7oPoe
Before the vote later tonight to re-open the federal government, I spoke on the floor to call on my colleagues to end this needless shutdown. https://t.co/LdGti77ewG

I’ve been fighting to reauthorize the #CHIP program for months. This short-term funding bill reauthorizes it for six years, providing much-needed long-term stability for children in #Ohio https://t.co/2SXdQendu0
Ohio has the 10th largest #CHIP program, helping 219,000 #Ohio children get health coverage—and 9M children nationwide. Urging my Democratic colleagues to join me in reauthorizing this critical program https://t.co/J0bGrlYDO9
There’s nothing in this short-term funding bill that either party opposes. It keeps the gov’t running &amp; extends #CHIP, which helps low-income children in need. https://t.co/scAQts6V50 #SaveCHIP
Last night I voted to keep the gov’t open and provide long-term funding for the #CHIP program. Unfortunately almost every Democrat opposed this common-sense bill https://t.co/scAQts6V50 #SaveCHIP
Shutdowns are unnecessary and counter-productive, and I would hope Democrats reconsider their opposition to this non-controversial, short-term funding bill and work with us to keep the government running. https://t.co/uDAYCplimg
There’s nothing in this short-term funding bill that either party opposes, and no one benefits from a shutdown. We should end government shutdowns for good:  https://t.co/uDAYCplimg

Today, we have a choice. We can vote to extend this critical funding for our nation’s children, or we can continue to kick the can down the road &amp; create instability for these families in need. My choice is clear: #ExtendCHIP
This week, on the Senate floor, I continued my push for a long-term funding solution for #CHIP. This is a critical issue to me, the families of 219,000 #Ohio kids, &amp; the families of more than 9 million kids nationwide. #ExtendCHIP https://t.co/lNpdLxPxl1
In December, I called for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate to enact a long-term funding solution for #CHIP: #ExtendCHIP https://t.co/a9UWGSqb2L
In October, I, along with the entire Senate Finance Committee, voted to extend #CHIP funding: https://t.co/2KjQUsBtmC #ExtendCHIP
The economy is, thanks largely to #taxreform, improving rapidly. Shutting down the government is a step backwards. Urge all my colleagues to keep the gov’t open: https://t.co/oY2pVFegzr
There is nothing in this short-term funding bill that Democrats object to. In fact, it keeps the gov’t open &amp; extends CHIP for a historic 6 years, a top priority for both parties. https://t.co/uvUqFTDqGy
On @SquawkCNBC, I detailed why gov’t shutdowns are counter-productive &amp; unnecessary. Urging all my colleagues to keep the gov’t open &amp; support #CHIP: https://t.co/Khr3jRIUWI

It is urgent that the House &amp; Senate implement a long-term solution to #SaveCHIP. In a recent floor speech, I discussed how CHIP helps protect more than 200,000 #Ohio kids: https://t.co/Vla94GFdQ7
We should all want American businesses to be more competitive on the global stage. #TaxReform is making that a reality: https://t.co/rvThrCaw4S
All over the country, there are companies large &amp; small that have announced pay increases, or bonuses, or increased 401(k) contributions, or increased pension contributions, or new investments in equipment and technology b/c of #taxreform
I am calling on the Senate to take up  #SESTA this month. There is no time to waste. It is up to Congress to act before more victims are subject to trauma and sold online. #EndHumanTrafficking. https://t.co/skDX7koy64
I am thankful that we have organizations like the Collaborative to #EndHumanTrafficking in Cleveland, who I met with on Friday, working tirelessly to combat this crime. #SESTA will help them. https://t.co/71xLsZrS9V
#SESTA closes a loophole in federal law to hold accountable those who engage in sex trafficking and to finally give victims the justice they deserve. #ListenToSurvivors https://t.co/E9kLKbk27Z
#HumanTrafficking has moved from the street corner, to the smart phone. Tragically, evil websites like Backpage have taken advantage of an archaic 1996 law that allows them to operate with immunity. #SESTA
When most people I talk to learn that #humantrafficking is happening all over #Ohio &amp; this country, that young women &amp; children are being sold online for sex in this country, they are shocked. But that is the reality and why we need #SESTA
No shortage of things to do here in Cincinnati. I encourage everyone to come and visit and see for yourself! https://t.co/ZENJi0eYwi

This week the @USATODAY editorial board praised my bipartisan #STOPAct: "To catch mass killer, focus on fentanyl shipments." This is exactly what the STOP Act will do: https://t.co/txeSZKuvcE
This wk, POTUS signed into law the bipartisan INTERDICT Act to help combat the #opioidepidemic. This bill will ensure we get the needed funds for screening equipment, but more must be done. Senate must also take up #STOPAct to identify the shipments &amp; help keep fentanyl out.
Inspired by the courage of so many women who have stepped forward to make passage of #SESTA possible. At this rally, we talked about how we are getting closer to giving victims the justice they deserve: https://t.co/voFk5M1dJR
On the Senate floor, I detailed how #TaxReform is leading to higher paychecks, more investments in plant &amp; equipment, and more #jobs. https://t.co/rvThrCs6Wq
On top of these business incentives &amp; the beneficial results we are already seeing of more investment, workers &amp; families will also get individual tax cuts: @USTreasury says abt 90% of employees are abt to see less withholding from the paycheck &amp; more help for the family budget.
#TaxReform is good for American workers. More #jobs, better pay &amp; benefits, and better tools, including new technology &amp; equipment. And for workers competing w/ foreign companies, we leveled the playing field: they no longer have to compete w/ one hand tied behind their back.
I also heard abt how the new lower tax rates and immediate expensing is responsible for increased investments in workers, more investment in plant and equipment and more #jobs. #TaxReform
At Sheffer Corporation in Cincinnati, Wolf Metals in Columbus, and Tremco in Cleveland, I had town hall meetings w/ employees.
As part of my Results for the Middle-Class #TaxReform Tour, I am traveling the state meeting w/ #Ohio workers who are benefiting from the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act. #Jobs
#HumanTrafficking is increasing here in Cleveland as it has moved from the street corner to the smart phone. It will continue to increase unless Congress acts. Congress must pass #SESTA https://t.co/PtwzDPYp5G
I am grateful for the efforts of those I met w/ today to play a role in helping to stop these crimes, but Congress must act to give law enforcement the ability to go after those who sell women and children online for sex. #SESTA https://t.co/QOpBKPnhRZ

#SESTA will ensure freedom of the internet but also help ensure that this kind of horrific behavior, human trafficking, will not continue. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay https://t.co/m1CiV7d5jF

The facts are clear. #Russia is attempting to undermine our institutions and values, weaken our alliances, and manipulate and divide public opinion. We must address this threat on a bipartisan basis. https://t.co/khOqUIETWE
For years, I have been concerned about Russian disinfo and propaganda against the U.S. and our allies. https://t.co/tsImYardKS
Join me live for a discussion on “Disrupting Online Exploitation: Why Survivors Are Standing Up for #SESTA." https://t.co/hkvDEzFiYf #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay
On @CNN w/ @ChrisCuomo, I discussed how the bipartisan Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (#SESTA) will help end online sex trafficking. #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay https://t.co/zPQHVML98z
Today is #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. It is a stain on our national character that sex trafficking is increasing. Excited to join survivors &amp; advocates today to push for Senate action on #SESTA.
Pleased to attend signing ceremony for the INTERDICT Act with President Trump at the White House to help give @CustomsBorder agents more tools to help keep fentanyl out. More must be done. #STOPAct
#Ohio companies are announcing more investment in plants and equipment, wage hikes, bonuses &amp; increased 401(k) matches for their workers b/c of #taxreform: https://t.co/afK0KZu7CE
For the 219,000 #Ohio kids, and the 9 million children nationwide who rely on this program, Congress must #SaveCHIP.
We need bipartisan cooperation to enact a long-term funding solution for CHIP. #SaveCHIP https://t.co/0wJH4IKoEU
It is crucial that countering foreign disinformation &amp; propaganda remain a bipartisan priority. Russian disinfo was a threat long before 2016 and will remain so long after.
Although progress has been made to counter Russian disinformation, much more work remains to be done. Looking forward to working with my Senate Foreign Relations Cmte colleagues to defend our allies, institutions, and values.
Courts have said it us up to Congress to act to help bring online sex traffickers to justice. That means passing #SESTA. #CDA230 https://t.co/gw6MvkBUHw
The 1996 Communications Decency Act is a well-intentioned law, but it needs to be updated for the 21st century. #SESTA #CDA230 https://t.co/BLb1XrJqiF
#SESTA is narrowly crafted, common-sense legislation that will help put an end to online sex trafficking in this country. It is needed now: https://t.co/a0rTXo4BWK
The bipartisan legislation will help ensure that tax dollars aren’t used to create #jobs overseas. It is needed now to protect American jobs. Read more about our bill here: https://t.co/JalvKK9gOd

It is unbelievable that in this century, in this country, sex trafficking is increasing. It is up to Congress to act: https://t.co/a0rTXo4BWK
The time is now for the Senate to crack down on online sex trafficking &amp; pass #SESTA: https://t.co/XdIreQxIZT

Also this year, significant progress was made in the fight to #endhumantrafficking, help Ohioans struggling w/ addiction, &amp; provide resources to our men &amp; women in uniform. But there is more to do. https://t.co/U7JVF9KkLs

Senate should act on #SESTA - we need to get this bill signed into law ASAP to protect women &amp; children from traffickers. https://t.co/MpMprAPdbj
#SESTA is supported by victims and advocates, law enforcement, the civil rights community, faith-based groups, and the larger tech community because it will help #EndHumanTrafficking.
We spent years in the Senate coming up with a bill that would address the scourge of sex trafficking. The result was #SESTA: https://t.co/MpMprAPdbj
I have seen these tax incentives work to leverage more private sector funding for  #Cincinnati &amp; #Ohio and generate more economic growth &amp; more tax revenue over time.
As a member of the tax-writing committee and the tax conference I fought hard to retain these important tax incentives for redevelopment and urban renewal  across #Ohio. https://t.co/OM3dYjp7Rq
The key tax incentives I helped preserve for #Ohio include the historic tax credit, the new markets tax credit, and private activity bonds. These urban  renewal tools have been successful in our state. https://t.co/OM3dYjp7Rq
The final House-Senate tax agreement preserves important tools for urban renewal that have worked well in Over-the-Rhine in #Cincinnati &amp; other areas of #Ohio, and I fought to preserve them.
#TaxReform means more money in the pockets of #Ohio workers and families. The nonpartisan JCT confirmed to me this week: https://t.co/X9TDeFlo2r
