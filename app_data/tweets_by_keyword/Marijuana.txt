@matthilgart_ @uhhhprechus I don't smoke but I agree with Matt. You literally have to smoke 1500 lbs of marijuana in 15 minutes to overdose, and it also is not very addicting. Overdoses are usually caused by alcohol, painkillers, sedatives, and worse yet a mix of them. Also a lot more addictive.

You're not going to end mass incarceration and the drug war if you're doing incremental change. We saw what happened when they criminalized alcohol and we're living through it again with criminalized weed. We have to legalize weed.
