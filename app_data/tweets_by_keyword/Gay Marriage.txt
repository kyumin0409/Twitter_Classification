So I read that @nytimes profile of a Trump-supporting gay couple and discovered - well, not a single thing. Yes, vapid gays can say things like "I don't like identity politics" too. Who cares? They owe their marriage and ability to show their faces in NYT to "identity politics."
@RNBenner @TELUS I've got mixed feelings about the whole thing. My mom's uncle #cameout after 40+ years of marriage.
He'd been happier to have just been #gay from the start but not in the #1950s.
My dad's baby brother was murdered by his bf.
My dad, a retired OPP, had to ID his bro.

That is analogous to me saying to you: "Hey, I really like you as a person, but because you are x race I can't attend your party celebrating y aspect of your race!"
@JoeySmoey5 @NRO @benshapiro Hillary and Barack both strongly opposed gay marriage until only recently.
The new US policy will insist they be married—even if they're from countries that criminalize gay marriage. Is this fair? Or is this unfair to limit diplomats? Share your #DBLtake with us

@Stevieb611 Of the world's population, only about 5% are US citizens. Don't say that you care about freedom when you don't want it for 95% of the world's population.

@ciara_of_course From having a read of Article 41, it isn't defined (my bad) but the "institution of Marriage" is mentioned so I imagine legal advice was given. I guess at the end of the day, as a gay Irish man, I feel safer knowing that I have a constitutional right to marry who I want to marry.
@Gay_and_Mormon I've had confirmation that the proclamation is the word of God. It was written for our day and members like you calling it into question is why it was written. There is no room for interpretation. Same sex marriage is wrong and not of God. I'm just supporting Gods words.

Gay marriage and transitioning doesn't affect you so why get mad about it? Or say awful things about.

@MissJennifer116 @thecjpearson I remember being 33, seeing homosexual kisses, and thinking “uggh I don’t want to see that.” I’m fully pro gay marriage and have absolutely no problem with gay anything. I just don’t want to see it. How is that a problem? (Also, I’m currently 33)

If I am wrong can you please provide evidence that gay marriage was a common practice in the first civilization, also can you please prove how a man could get pregnant during this time.
Anyone really think Nancy Pelosi is much of a lightning rod in 2018? Made more sense in 2004 era of gay marriage panic, Gavin Newsom, Bush religious right stuff...but now? What in her legislative past should she regret? The right built a windmill, how long can they tilt at it.

@realDJT2020 @freedom_moates Gay relationship have always existed.  Individuals are born gay. No one chooses to be gay.  Therefore, God made them gay.  It is not up to me to judge them.  If they are wrong they will answer to God. Not to you or me.  Being gay has always been legal.  Same sex marriage is new.

@vivekt17 @EricRWeinstein And it's equally pointless. Gay marriage is a complete non story made up to be huge by the media of the "woke" generation. Marriage other than as a formalisation of a long term family commitment is nothing but seeking approval by the state for your personal relationships.

@carolynmichelle There will always be prejudice but society is moving towards acceptance. In the 80s it was "ok" to make fun of gays. In the 90s people started to realize there was nothing wrong with it. Then gay marriage was the end of the world, until it wasn't. Now its trans rights.

@Gay_and_Mormon I counter argue you haven't truly received anything from God about gay marriage. That's just your wishful thinking.

Like with gay marriage and abortion, it doesn’t affect anyone but the two people involved so i just don’t get why someone is against it. It might sound harsh that I’m not against abortion or gay marriage but to me it only makes sense to not be.
@BrySimpson I think you took exactly the correct takeaways here.  Bryan went into why he doesn't believe it, he feels that those days are over, gay marriage is the law of the land (it was one of their top issues in the past) and that now it's just divisive.
@LunaLamb_MFC I legalized gay marriage, you're welcome.
I think it’s because, historically, the word “partner” refers to a relationship that is more serious than just “boyfriend/girlfriend” but without the legal status of “husband/wife” as gay marriage wasn’t legalised yet. I believe it‘s also derived from the term “civil partnership” https://t.co/2K1WMOkzsD

@radfemin @SpeakUp4WomenNZ @nzlabour @jacindaardern 1. Gay men and lesbians had common ground on issues like decriminalisation, discrimination and same-sex marriage. After those victories, do gay men and lesbians belong in the same movement?
@DuckDuckGoose95 I know, I am all for raising awareness about it and legalising gay marriage etc but I do think some people are a bit obsessive with it and push their agendas onto others aggressively
@hannahpikanya gay marriage has been legalized recently in japan though??
@jameswwight But then you wouldn't be buying local business? And so don't go out, this day won't be for you. Honestly you sound like trump supporters with the generalizations and patronizing manner of your comments. Don't you believe in gay marriage? Doesnt mean you have to be gay.
@SayNo2BigGay I agree with her I think incest should be legallized because same sex marriage has been legalised, gay rights are legal, gay &amp; same sex adoption is now legal so I think incestuous couples should be able to free to share love with each other openly &amp; freely as they want in life

Yes, Taiwan is a democracy. But, it has still Asian traditions that it must uphold like opposition to same-sex marriage so does the Philippines, even if we are democracy too. That is the reality. Adding to that is the conservatism in Filipino society.

also, japan is still behind when it comes to gay marriage and LGBTQ+ rights in general, but you won't be jailed or killed for it, rallies and marches take place, and small victories are happening. i would compare it to america a few decades back? just so everyone knows.
@reason the way gay marriage was legalized was not a victory. The courts should not make law using Substantive Due Process which is the opposite of what we want, since all the courts need to do to get rid of a change is to overrule that case.

@nyikonyoka007 @TimesLIVE I agree if we're talking about a privately-owned &amp; especially a religious organization. But on the other hand everyone has the right to equal services from government. So if gay marriage is legal then there's no reason why they should not receive the same service from government.

@Gay_and_Mormon They didn't get it wrong. And being raised that marriage is between man and woman is the right way to be raised. But keep on having your progressive views. Those are directly against Gods plan.
@MichaelKellyIC Hmm, and still they are the ONLY  elected political party in Ireland saying No to abortion and gay marriage. We should also not lose sight of the fact that there are other people in Northern Ireland who aren't EU superstate supporters and who want nothing to do with it.

@Vampira666_ It’s just fucking disgusting especially after a GOP AG spent millions opposing rulings affirming gay marriage. MI was one of the cases leading to Obergefell.
I like that in @ChickFilA's response letter they write "we do not have a political or social agenda."... which is quite surprising seeing how much money they poured into anti-gay-rights causes like blocking marriage equality and their continued funding of anti-gay groups.
@LeosRightSock Didnt ireland just recently legalize gay marriage? So you dont mind perverts destroying your culture and Christian values, but only feel threatened when it is Islam that threatens your way of life. Hypocritical.

@scottdpreece @DenverUte No, sir. Gay marriage kinda was: I remember traveling to Hawaii for the first time in 1998 at 13 and seeing an advertisement for a referendum to legalize gay marriage in the state and knowing that was sinful, not even realizing the Proclamation has been given just 3 years before.

@chimeracoder @Into That made sense to me. As in "this is a private issue." Which it is. I've always said that if you don't like gay marriage, don't get one. It would be hypocritical of me to fault someone who actually took that advice to heart.
Very interesting article by @davidmcw:

=A.D., to many people here &amp; in the world, this is a controversial subject. Society here once tried using non-existent &amp; twisted Scriptural meaning to condemn Gay people, just as they'd done earlier regarding segregation &amp; degradation of Afro-Americans.  https://t.co/hWiaFlL5wJ
In all fairness, if the Catholic Church was actually doing that and legalizing gay marriage could actually stop it, then that’s a pretty good argument for legalizing it.
@spressto @cameron_kasky @Awizomsound No he’s saying the gay rights movement was more about sexual liberation FROM marriage, not towards it and the parades featured ridiculous displays of queerness such as naked Jesus, guys in assless chaps, etc. That’s a movement that had little to do with expanding “dignity.”

@gaytimesmag I’m happy but really this is the dumbest subject the world could possibly come up with, with half of all marriages ending in divorce,(I doubt gay numbers are any different) the fact that we still use "marriage" as a political idea is absurd, about as absurd as one can get.

@JuanIsidro @Cernovich I feel like your assessment of media attention is a few years out of date. Since the marriage ruling, a lot of the impetus and coverage of gay politics has dwindled to the occasional cake-bake controversy. Women, however, have dominated media.

@SonicKaw EVERY political issue is a moral issue.

Gay marriage. Abortion. Trans rights. Healthcare. Either you're for them, or you're against them. You can't legislate a middle ground (there's granularity, but you can't...do nothing).

All of these are moral and contentious issues.

@BullMooseFuture @Thurkagord @RubinReport @benshapiro For example, a liberal is pro gay marriage while a leftist is for government mandating that church’s perform wedding ceremonies.  There are gradations within the belief structure of the party.  That’s all these two terms are used for.
@ldsthoughts92 Agreed. Him and Papa Ostler are actively preaching that gay marriage will be allowed in the church in the future. They carefully word it but that's what they're preaching. 

And it's ridiculous for them to do that.
@maruojin The anti gay marriage groups' strategy was really shrewd, as forcing civil partnership instead of full marriage was the most likely way to erode the court's ruling.

Beyond the emotional, there is essentially no societal benefit to gay marriage whereas traditional marriage was atleast at its founding the ground for child rearing and incentivizing the maintanence of the family.
@dragqueens5 @JeramySinopoli @JamesMartinSJ @Bishopoftyler According to scripture, tradition and reason, same sex acts are disordered.  God forbids same sex intercourse.   So gay sex is always a sin even if two people exchange marital vows as the essence of marriage is two becoming one to participate in God’s procreative nature.

Early results against #lgbt marriage isn't surprising. The anti gay marriage camp had the most visible referendum campaign likely in Taiwan history.

#taiwanelection
@ChoiJeongSan The only people clamoring for gay “marriage” were in LA and NYC. No one else was asking for it.
Taiwanese conservatives defeated the pro gay marriage referendum and the DPP's been useless about keeping their promises. Goddammit.
According to the article, the founder of @htc  is backing anti-gay groups to fight against marriage equality in Taiwan! Those anti-gay groups are spreading false information about LGBT, escalating discrimination against LGBT in Taiwan.

#australia 🏄🏼‍♂️ is an AWESOME country and since gay marriage is legal in #australia 🦘 that country is swell 🤙🏼 i’m totes gonna move to #australia 🐨

it’s legal for chicks to date chicks there 😂 not that i’m interested in dating, never dated in my life but i think dating sucks 😐
Really enjoyed this @jon_rauch piece at @reason on what was essentially a long PR battle for marriage equality and ending marijuana prohibition. https://t.co/A16lFNKtVC
@HRC @OUTBermuda I’ll still never travel there because the Bermudan public still supports banning marriage equality. In a 2016 referendum, nearly 70% of voters in that country voted in favor of banning it. That’s a huge anti-gay majority, making Bermuda a VERY unsafe place for gay travelers.

@adarondax1 @realDonaldTrump You said the world envies America, no they don't. The world envies Australia. We have free health care, a stable economy and low interest rates. We have marriage equality for gay couples and we don't rig our elections. We definitely don't have a sexual predator as our leader.

Yeah, sure, the leadership has an ass-backwards view on gay marriage, but the CEO backed away from involving the company in it at least.

@MsMelChen I think it's a rejection of the flawed reasoning behind gay marriage.  Which is good. If biological sex doesn't matter, why won't age, or number of partners? #loveislove is simplistic propaganda.

I don’t know when I’ll come out. Could be today, tomorrow or next week I don’t fucking know. But all I know is, is that I’m scared of my family’s reaction. My mum loves gay couples and supports them but she voted no for gay marriage (yeah we still won)

It also illustrates a staggering lack of awareness that the GOP abandoned the fundamental tenets of genuine conservatism decades ago. 

Fiscal conservatism?  Name a recent GOP POTUS who balanced a budget. 

Small government?  Abortion rights. 

Individual liberty?  Gay marriage. https://t.co/neTn7jxP28

@JaneneHague @RSmyth22 @Jim_Jordan Read the Bible as it also talks in the Old Testament about borders. If you are so concerned and a so called real Christian then do not support abortion and gay marriage which is ungodly.

@day_gardner @WashTimes Loony-bird Biden. He lost his mind when he sold his soul to support the murder of unborn children and gay marriage, going against his faith teachings. His rantings are just a symptom of the rotting disease of sin in his soul.
@SimonHu49509082 @Alyssa_Milano I’m asking you to think.  Why do conservatives oppose gay marriage? There are many non-hating logical, intelligent reasons. My prior examples  of “love as love” are unacceptable behavior. Even though they are “love”. You are basing your views on emotional feelings not intellect.
@Trouble1000000 @abc730 @leighsales That was my point you blithering fuckwit. They have all the protection under the law except for those exemptions in the Anti-discrimination law and Mental Health Act. And thanks to the Mental Health Act still being in force &amp; unchanged, the gay marriage allowance is invalid.
