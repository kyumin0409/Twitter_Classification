@Howdoipants @JulieKlee @ParkerMolloy @jmscolter09 @robrousseau Well there‚Äôs a couple of things wrong with that. First you‚Äôd have to prove that his claim that the boys are post pubescent is false. Also the church is against gay marriage so if priests are gay that would be a problem for them.
Also, I love how having a traditional view of marriage somehow makes you hate gay people. Nobody is capable of nuance anymore, but I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised.

@WhiteGenophilia @NoTatsClassy Back in the early-to-mid 90s, televangelists were accusing the gay community of wanting to "recruit" young people, and that normalizing gay relationships would not only lead to marriage but to their wanting to legalize pedophilia.  Of course, we all called them fear-mongers.
Elder Packer in a 1990 GC talk issued a warning that has become a reality 28 years later.  Abortion, gay marriage and now drugs (marijuana) all legal. Those of us who stand against these measures are now the evil and intolerant ones.  Oh how good has become evil and evil good!

@PGreaves02 @maria_thewitch Support for gay marriage didn‚Äôt increase until the first state that legalized it. And there were other legal steps that normalized same sex relationships, like decriminalization, as well as equality in other countries. We shouldn‚Äôt ignore the effect of the law on social norms.

@Gay_and_Mormon @JCBontheDL @matt_evelo @JPBellum @mikejbower @OfSifter @MormonLibsLMAO True, as people they are not infallible. However, God has been 100% consistent in saying that marriage is between a man and a woman.

Thus, I would guess that His position is not going to change.

@Claude__Cat @nytimes These two views are contradicting of each other. He didnt say that his favorite color is red but his company's is blue. The main argument of "religious" people against gay marriage is that it is a scared institution and between man and woman, per bible. You know this I'm sure.

Thank you for solving the abortion and gay marriage debate, please go let your church know to drop it.
The results of Taiwan‚Äôs anti-gay marriage referendums this weekend are heartbreaking,  but putting minority rights up for a vote rarely ensures justice. So we urge Taiwan‚Äôs government to enact the marriage equality its own Supreme Court legalized in 2017. https://t.co/JZV1MsqYza
@FranOSullivan @LizzieMarvelly A couple of belated points Fran:
‚ñ™Garner and Hosking identify as commentators, not journalists, and both have spoken against gay marriage.
‚ñ™Main-stream Media were hostile to decriminalisation of homosexuality, resulting in life being pure hell for gay teens in NZ in the 1980s.

@PunishedKab Eorzea doesn't legally recognize gay marriage even though everyone there dresses like Liberace on a bad acid trip.
@martinxo Are they? As a non-woman, it all sounds a bit like 'marriage is for me not these gay folk'. It'd never occur to me to tell someone how they should feel or define themselves as; I guess others find that easier. Also can't see how this clashes with women's fight for equality.

@LifewHer it seems so large because it‚Äôs always in your face...i applaud the community for that. BUT the community is still minuscule to the general pop. and let‚Äôs not forget that ONLY TWENTY SEVEN countries have legalized gay marriage....in the entire world.
@MidwestMomm4 @Barbara29034340 @lordkilchester @RealJamesWoods Yes please. Majority doesn‚Äôt mean moral. I don‚Äôt care about democracy, I care about freedom. If you open your eyes you will see no one cares about democracy. I didn‚Äôt see the left asking for a national vote after the Supreme Court ruled in their favor on gay marriage.
Nothing about today‚Äôs disappointing result in #Taiwan undermines the country‚Äôs highest court, which has affirmed marriage as a constitutional guarantee for #gay couples. Now more than ever, lawmakers must enact the freedom to marry. https://t.co/VPKus17t5k
You guys are talking about gay marriage. If you are against it that doesn't mean you are homophobic or retarded. Just saying.
I also read someone saying that if you're against gay marriage but not gays then it's the same as saying I'm not racist but.

That's probably the most dumbest thing I'll read today but I'm not holding on because Lebtarded Twitter always finds a way to surprise me. Bless them.

@ilovemusic684 That‚Äôs really nice! In my country same sex marriage was never illegal i think(I never really looked that up other than if gay marriage was legal or not) and I believe the government is working on adoption and thinking about giving trans people the possibility to do the surgery
@nyikonyoka007 @TimesLIVE I agree if we're talking about a privately-owned &amp; especially a religious organization. But on the other hand everyone has the right to equal services from government. So if gay marriage is legal then there's no reason why they should not receive the same service from government.
@Nuckols @tharzula @PastorRyanK @MethodistView @servetus If someone supports same sex marriage &amp; openly gay clergy, then on the issue of homosexual behavior they are not orthodox. That‚Äôs the language context.

@chimeracoder @Into That made sense to me. As in "this is a private issue." Which it is. I've always said that if you don't like gay marriage, don't get one. It would be hypocritical of me to fault someone who actually took that advice to heart.
Very interesting article by @davidmcw:
‚ÄòCulturally, there is a deep strain within the Unionist tribe that won‚Äôt accept the Republic on any level. Once we were too Catholic for them, now - having voted for both gay marriage and abortion - we are too liberal.‚Äô https://t.co/pEyVaUCukR

In all fairness, if the Catholic Church was actually doing that and legalizing gay marriage could actually stop it, then that‚Äôs a pretty good argument for legalizing it.
@spressto @cameron_kasky @Awizomsound No he‚Äôs saying the gay rights movement was more about sexual liberation FROM marriage, not towards it and the parades featured ridiculous displays of queerness such as naked Jesus, guys in assless chaps, etc. That‚Äôs a movement that had little to do with expanding ‚Äúdignity.‚Äù

@Geoff73774215 @PrisonPlanet I don't think a gay artist should be forced to make pamphlets for a Defense of Marriage Act campaign.
Or a feminist forced to make MRA posters, or MGTOW forced to make cards with a punchline about smothering men till they stop complaining.

Artists MUST be free to refuse service.

Is @benshapiro against attending 2nd &amp; 3rd marriages that came about due to adultery or is gay marriage the only sinful thing he condemns? If being gay is against his religion, you'd think he'd be just as rigid about "celebrating" adultery https://t.co/Mitl7szJ26
@nytimes He‚Äôs right, of course. Not sure why that is controversial.

What SHOULD be controversial is gay marriage supporters thinking that others have to believe the same way they do on what marriage is and means.
