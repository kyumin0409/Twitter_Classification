@Atlantiso1 No, it isn't cheap junk steel but imported steel that is used today but at an artificially high price due to the tariffs. Buying an American made car using American made steel built by American labor is in the distant past. The car companies and the unions ruined it in the 70's.
@actgm28 @TimRyan @OHDems It's the next step, and it gives the workers a greater say, and higher pay! But yes, unions are great, and if they are truly devoted to the workers, they want them to be worker owned. Like the IWW, who played a huge part in the labor movement.

@AdamPr0ct0r The points are valid, the framing is not. There are hundreds of freedoms that allow the ruling class to exploit the working class. Should we have fought women entering the workplace because expanding the labor pool so much would weaken unions and drive down wages?

@ShadwDrgn @gaelofdarkness @VoiceOfOBrien There are far more lives lost with every regulation that doesn‚Äôt exist or deregulation.
Take a look at Flint, Exxon Valdez, Deep Water Horizons, and pretty much every regulation that allowed the formation of labor unions.
They almost all exist because people died.
Encouraging the growth of labor unions and encouraging them to bargain to have a say in investment decisions (where and how to invest capital) is the path towards saving jobs and protecting workers. Anything less leaves all the leverage with employers.

@Joshuah1986 @writerguydell @vincentdonofrio Both parties are complicit in pandering with anti-immigrant rhetoric while purposely maintaining a black market labor underclass.
Either ending immigration or amnesty and open borders must be avoided at all costs to prevent labor unions from having a resurgence.
