Daily reminder that in my state, the NoVa Democrats used a hospital as a political bargaining chip to crowbar in more gibs for their voting demographic in the northern part of the state.

@DaveLG @john_sipher Bigoted rednecks had a tough choice. A black man or a woman tweeker. They should have pondered a higher minimum wage and Medicaid expansion -- always support the Democrat! Oh well.
@JK_Riki @pixelprotectors @Lalanamour @RandomNobody86 @freespeechtalks @jayrale @artsygirl20 @gypsyglutton @LeahNTorres It's not an assumption. It's logic. 

Medicaid and CHIP has been cut. More children will be born into poverty, and with poverty comes an increase in abuse. 

This is how the world works. "Fixing" the abortion issue without fixing the other problems will exacerbate things.

Something needs to be done about the cost of prescriptions to older/senior people. Especially Veterans. When $800 is too much money w/o A CHILD to get Medicaid or foodstamps! Could YOU imagine living off $800 a month. Boy is that rich!
