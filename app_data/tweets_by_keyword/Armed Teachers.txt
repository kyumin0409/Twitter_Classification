@jessalexandraa_ Okay well if teachers and everyone inside schools are armed and educated on using a firearm don't you think things like that could be prevented more rather than taking the guns away from  people who rightfully own them and use them correctly? Criminals will still possess them
@TheAfroSmash Teachers should have been armed. Also, train toddlers to use a machine gun too.

I cannot think that black or brown teachers would take that risk.
Not saying that teachers must have guns, or even that any would want to if given the option. But I promise you that those brave teachers who shielded their students with their bodies would have been of more service to the students armed than that garbage school deputy. https://t.co/Qdk9ozNXUA

@AmmoLand Not for nothing, but even if they had no intention of arming teachers, publicizing that they are armed wouldn't be a bad idea in &amp; of itself.

@thejtlewis There was one armed plain-clothed security person (might have been active duty LAPD) in my L.A. suburban high school in 1976. He was known to all the students as Deputy Fife from Mayberry. We joked his gun wasn't loaded but probably was. Back then teachers broke up fights too.
Whether you want more gun control, or armed teachers, Safety Book improves odds by stopping the tested rounds. Mass shooters don't ask their victims how they voted. You can do something yourself, trust others to do it, or both. Take it or leave it, but being ugly is a bad choice.
Can you imagine if we actually armed teachers.

Police enter a school during an active shooter situation.

Now you don't have one or two people with guns, now you have 10.

Who's the shooter???

@WalshFreedom Better to hire armed guards for schools than to arm the teachers. Teachers already have an impossible job, and a poorly paid one - asking they become cops and guards, in addition to all their other duties, will further destroy an already crumbling system.

Because it's happened to bystanders, and it's happened to security guards.

Absurd to think teachers in many school districts can be denied their constitutional right to armed self protection.
