Most people are not “pro-life”. To truly be able to call yourself “pro-life” you would have to also be against the death penalty, assisted suicide, war, killing in self-defense and euthanasia."

@settlercollecto @bobbycat14 Your entire stance here has been that assisted suicide should be available to EVERYONE with a terminal illness, regardless of country. Has it not? Then why is your stance also "but don't talk about it, or try to get there, or even discuss the legality of the issue"????

@siano2020 Other more accepting cultures (Canada) refer to it as Medical Assistance in Dying, not physician assisted suicide. It's not like physicians do it for people who are depressed; there's a clinical assessment for end of life ptnts and  in consultation with the ptnt's circle of care.

Euthanasia is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. Assisted suicide is suicide committed with the aid of another person, sometimes a physician.
@jasminh54538452 Assisted suicide should’ve been allowed if the person was in the right mental state to make the decision, although I morally feel for the doctor because it is a very hard decision to do that to someone
@HillckHill @JPalmer1967 @siano2020 The laws as they exist don't know the difference. This is all magic wand theory. None of it is practical because it's already illegal in multiple ways. Again. You cannot get to "assisted suicide" without first legalizing "suicide". It's just not possible.
@pattonoswalt No! Just no.... There are not enough crunches in the world to counteract that obese burger those skinny people are consuming. I call bullshit... Even as a fat man, I can't justify the calories. That burger should only be available in states that allow assisted suicide.
@settlercollecto Do you understand yet? If you want to legalize assisted suicide on a national level in the US...you first must rewrite crisis intervention laws. That is not my opinion. That is how law works. We cannot write laws in America that contradict other laws. It simply does not work.

@MrDarthVader2U @RealEnzoLoren There is, ironically, a doctor in Oregon with ALS. OR is a state with assisted suicide. He's had a prescription on file with the local pharmacy for years. He says knowing it's there lightens the burden, but has felt no compulsion to get the meds to do it, yet.

Crying my eyes out at this Louis Theroux doc about assisted suicide, why do I do this to myself 😭
@siano2020 Yes, I think physician-assisted suicide should be legal, but with regulations. It'd have to be a terminally ill patient who is experiencing constant pain, and only if the patient can consent. We put our pets down to end their suffering, and they can't even consent like humans.
@siano2020 If you believe that death is the end and there is no prospect of suffering after death, then physician assisted suicide is logical and compassionate (although open to abuse). However, many believe death is not the end and to commit suicide is an unwise response to pain

Technically murder isn’t murder it’s assisted suicide cause your body is the thing that kills you in the end therefore all deaths are suicides.
@boxbrown Back problems? Well, everybody likes to bring up weed as a treatment any time a medical issue is discussed, but ever consider assisted suicide? Okay, maybe that's a little extreme LOL, but maybe it's time at least to just legalize it recreationally instead of kidding ourselves.
Voters in Victorian election need to guard against attempts by some parties to repeal Victoria’s landmark assisted suicide legislation. @Davidleyonhjelm in the Australian Financial Review. #ldpau #auspol  https://t.co/91xsX0hGki

@StormIsUponUs Avoid the Clinton-assisted suicide, Julian.
@shannonrwatts @ClaudiaBrenne Well after watching two parents die of Alzheimer’s and the US Nursing Home industry bankrupt my family (no Medicare doesn’t help folk - you gotta be poor) we need assisted suicide and healthcare reform- not this.
Seeing a lot of people celebrating the Labor win in Victoria by talking about it being a win for assisted suicide. Uhhhh, did everyone forget how many disabled people came out strongly against those specific laws and how it affects them? (yes they did)

I have Parkinson’s. I’m in pain every day and have difficulty maneuvering. I do not want to be helped to die. I reject #AssistedSuicide. I reject those who tell me to die so I will not be a burden on my family. #IChooseLife, you can too.

@NBCNews @NBCLeftField Two words: Assisted Suicide. I hope this is something we can all get behind. I don’t want anyone taking care of me, &amp; I know my Dad doesn’t, either. We’ve had control over things our whole lives, why give it up when the end is near? #compassionate #assistedsuicide #personalchoice

Isn't assisted suicide supposed to be illegal?

Supreme Court refuses Mr. Conway permission to appeal -prospects of him persuading the SC to declare the ban on assisted suicide incompatible with his Art 8 right to the death of his choosing were insufficient. 
This balance, said the SC, is a matter for parliament, not judges. https://t.co/iUC63VmiLf
@theladykatie Wait, who is the 'someone else'? So can I assume you would also be against assisted suicide or anytime a family 'pulls the plug'?
People say “If you’d take a pill to treat the heart, it’s the same for if you need a pill to treat the brain.” By that argument, I should be able to commit physician assisted suicide: people who live in continual, physical pain have that as an option (some places). I live (cont)

@JoySC01 Thanks Joy.  More concerned about my mom dealing with this, as he's obviously at peace with decision but I'm glad BC has the same sort of set up that Victoria will have in a few years.  re:  assisted suicide.  If Uncle Willy doesn't want to suffer...why should he?
@kaaytie84 @FLOTUS @POTUS @WhiteHouse Veterns? Don't know. But maybe you should do some research on which enemies are being assisted by which president. And on Obama's veterans programs. And on veteran suicide rates over the past 20 years. And homelessness. And children in distress in america. But you won't.
One of my niggas just referred to murder as assisted suicide and I can’t stop laughing big Jajajajaja
@HillckHill @JPalmer1967 @siano2020 Doctors are sworn to do no harm and bound by law to report and indeed intervene when suicidal ideation is present. That's what crisis intervention is. Before we can even discuss "assisted suicide" we must first discuss suicide. No?
@settlercollecto @HillckHill @JPalmer1967 @siano2020 Also I do not live in a state where assisted suicide is legal. No cocktails here. 😉
