@AoDespair Tbh, the fact that we now execute people in sterile rooms in the middle of the night with no audience does very little to deter crime-- which is the primary argument to maintain capital punishment to begin with. All the more reason to abolish it altogether.

False dichotomy. Many crucial issues come up around killing: war, WMDs, capital punishment, abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, stand your ground. Fact remains: can't feel=can't suffer

@JZmirak Wouldn't hanging strike more fear into you than being anesthetized as you lie on a gurney? In that sense it's more humane. I just want capital punishment - because I'm convinced it saves innocent lives.
@kalikush11 @TheNameIsDinn @JulyJane @ByronYork Some states still use hanging as a form of capital punishment. If an order comes down from a judge, it's called an execution. Just because it's not a public execution doesn't mean it is "murder".

Lynchings ARE murder, as they weren't legally handed down by a judge.

@reedfrich Your sections do not refute my point. A hanging, a legal execution method, were it used, is  NOT a lynching. I am Jewish, and had she said "Id not min seeing a gassing" I would be able to discern the differences between US capital punishment and what the Nazis did.

There is not reason any mass murderer or sexual deviant should be alive once convicted.

@MiamiHerald Can we call it fair mandatory capital punishment for any guilty pedophiles and rapists by hanging (the ones with positive kits)? The reason they repeat is knowing their just going to jail to be lazy and fed three times a day while children are starving and can't afford shoes.
