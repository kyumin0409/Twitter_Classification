Irony alert:

A big part of this USMCA trade deal that Trump is touting was simply cut and pasted from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trump was highly critical of the TPP and ,when he first took office, pulled the United States out of that deal. He‚Äôs ALL smoke and mirrors.
One of the aspects to President Trump is he doesn‚Äôt bluff. They said he wouldn‚Äôt pull out of the Paris Climate Treaty, he did.  They said he wouldn‚Äôt withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he did.  They said he wouldn‚Äôt implement global Steel/Aluminum tariffs, he did.......
@uncriticalsimon @TheScepticIsle @AlastairBreward That's an EU agreement.  Why do you believe the UK would have the same? Do Trans-Pacific Partnership members have FoM for people?
The PM‚Äôs deal would rule out any prospect of UK trade deals with the US, let alone accepting the invitation to join the Trans Pacific Partnership. The EU will be able to offer their trade partners access to UK market for EU exporters. We are paying ¬£39 billion for this!!
