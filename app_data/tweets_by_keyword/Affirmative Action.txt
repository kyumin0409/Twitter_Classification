@RagingGayCons rich privilege is much more a thing than white privilege, so its certainly a fairer system than based on race. still not sure id be 100% behind it but affirmative action based on race is racist and so anyway to end it has got to be a positive step for equality!

@RagingGayCons Are you a conservative or a socialist?  Affirmative action is forced equality on any basis. Just my opinion.
@Chad96547890 @AnnaRitschke So actual racism is comparable to affirmative action ? Is that  comparable to giving a chance to a minority that has less access to  higher education anyways ? Stop with the false equivalencies. I'm not defending that, simply stating it's incomparable.
@710Listener @ScottMGreer Californians also voted against affirmative action in another referendum back in the 90s. It was a hell of a lot more right-wing in the past. Dumping tens of millions of illegal immigrants on the state though is bound to tilt it to the left.

@AuthorSingh @Triggerasaurus3 @vijaya @jack @TwitterIndia @ltgiv @Daddy_Warpig @BrowningMachine @gab Affirmative action always starts with good intentions and always ends as a cruel hoax.

@Ocasio2018 @williamlegate You had an bachelor's in economics and became a bartender. Affirmative action was likely applied to you for both your sex and race. You claim you can't get a place to live when your savings contains between $15,000 and $50,000. 3 branches of government...not chambers

Affirmative action is the abuse of human rights.
Only individuals exist and only they have rights.

Affirmative or positive action is a well-established and accepted doctrine internationally and is a means of promoting employment of members of groups that have previously suffered from structural discrimination or exclusion.

@TheDukeofIngo Inevitable result of 14 years of left wing media and feminists "affirmative action" that programs children to believe that having an ass is a qualification for success in life. Thanks to social media, the stereotype is facing stiff rejection.

@2Jackornot2Jack @AvBronstein @joshnathankazis @jdforward The exception to this? Schools like Berkeley, where affirmative action is banned. In those cases, Jews end up being under 10% of the population. The biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action BY FAR are Jews &amp; the biggest losers are non-Jewish whites. Which was always the plan.

Female representation in politics is currently poor, it will be worse by 2019 going by the names submitted to inec. The question is should we adhere to the 35 percent affirmative action? Should it be legalised? Or should we keep taking chances. @eunice_atuejide @tolulopeab

I hate when people belittle affirmative action, especially for people of color, when it has existed since the creation of the first college in the United States. The only major difference NOW is that it is no longer solely for wealthy white men
@TooGrownToParty @BarStarDee @NioooMimi @Killmongerally @FeckMargie @blkempresss @TalibKweli @chYnaRIP @nlarue055 @EricDJuly A lot of white people benefit from admission preferences that have been around far longer than affirmative action.

@trulydavi Affirmative action is anything but ‚Äúequal opportunity‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally a law to force whites out and POC in.  How does it feel to know that you only have your job because there‚Äôs a government gun to the head of your employer?
The only systematic racism that exists is affirmative action.
@au336680 @BDSixsmith @michaelbd No one is being forced to work fewer hours after they have children. Discrimination against mothers happens, sure, as does affirmative action in their favour. That's at most a tiny contributor to the gap.
Hill's misguided notion that "Palestinians" (i.e. Philistines) r being occupied by Jews and blacks r being "occupied" by whites (after many decades of Diversity- and Affirmative Action-based preferential treatment) is itself base. Per Genesis, Jewish land is from river to river. https://t.co/lMs4daFD9q

How is AA more specific if that could mean anyone of African descent who lives in America? Look at affirmative action eg.
@StephBee8111 @thehill What? Lmao how is a collective group of Asians suing the concept of ‚Äúaffirmative action‚Äù? I am aware of an Asian Americans vs. Harvard lawsuit currently in the works.
Holtzman v. New Jersey. (1922) Affirmative action cannot interfere with free exercise of religion.
I‚Äôve recently been trying to call out this behaviour online when I‚Äôve seen it. Just because a Black comedian does the whole ‚Äúcat eating‚Äù schtick at a restaurant does not equate to Asians trying to get rid of affirmative action. One is mean and rude, the other destroys lives.
@danielledsouzag @DineshDSouza Affirmative action is also racist. Basically saying

 "well obviously blacks aren't good enough to get into college on their own... I guess we'll let them in... We feel sorry for them..."

Can it get any more racist?

@1upmovement @tariqnasheed Blacks in America are freer &amp; have more opportunity that 95% of the world. In fact, programs like affirmative action give blacks extra opportunity to make up for wrongs of 50+ years ago. But don't let me stop you from blaming all of your life's failings on a racist boogy man.
Listening to some men crowing "Just go out &amp; fight for it!" in reference to affirmative action, reminds me of the white man trying to scold the black man for not reaching the heights of the former

Yes. Quite.

Two points:
1) Affirmative action should never be permanent. It should assist one/two generations, with the ones after that no longer needing a crutch. 
2) Affirmative action has not been effective. Already rich, politically connected Malays have benefitted more than the poor. https://t.co/CFc5LWA0lo

I think this Affirmative Action Bill (Constitutional Amendment)will just disenfranchise women more in their pursuit to win elective posts. It's time womenfolk took numerical advantage of their numbers to win more seats and support each other.
