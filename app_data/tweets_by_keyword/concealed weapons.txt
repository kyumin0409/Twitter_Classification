@mchooyah Santa aka my lovely wife got me an early present....Concealed Weapons Permit Class.
If you want to stop mass shootings the proven and effective answer is to allow law abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons. Stricter gun laws absolutely do nothing to prevent mass shootings. Politicians know this but they have to appeal to really dumb people like most of CA.
@mlmcmillan @RepPaulCook @TOMS Weak. Your statistical arguement fails. Homicide rates have been cut in half as guns have doubled. You want to fix violence? End the drug war, welfare stare, and prohibition on transstate concealed weapons.

Besides having a concealed weapons permit and walking around packing everyday, how do you suppose we put a stop to revenge, hatred, and jealousy of other people? I can only control myself!
