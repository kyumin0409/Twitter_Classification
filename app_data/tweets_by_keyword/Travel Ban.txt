@BeschlossDC I said at the time of the travel ban cases that transparently political decisions would undermine confidence in the supposedly “independent judiciary” - that’s what happened. The SCOTUS should rebuke the leftist judges - instead Roberts attacks the messenger.

@FrakNugget @FabulousLVNV @bethechange0412 @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes I didnt say he couldn't, I said it was not legal. Just like the travel ban, the courts will rule unconstitutional.

@ShannonBream Yea... That's the way it's supposed to be! But in reality, it is definitely not!

@nprpolitics It's an open secret that Liberal plaintiffs purposely try to bring cases with political overtones in the 9th District jurisdiction in order to "judge shop". That is why the Univ of Washington was the plaintiff in the most notable "travel ban" case.

The kicker to me not being afraid to ban and remove problematic people is they tend to travel in packs. This means they will probably go someplace else of course bringing their issues with them. If the next streamer doesn't take a stand the health of their chat nosedives.

@arthur_boone @realDonaldTrump SCOTUS already ruled that he had the authority to regulate immigration before (travel ban case), also I’m interested to know what specific crimes against Americans are you refferring to? Just wondering which ones (I’m not aware of them so please tell me)
That's the only thing wrong with the travel ban, but had a bad court, we had a court what I consider to be — he didn't just call Russia.
@FLOTUS Like me, when I am stuck here and can not travel to my country, and my parents can not come because of the Muslim ban your husband ordered.

@velivasakis @realDonaldTrump There is. It's called the Constitution. And SCOTUS ruled that the President has the authority in the so called travel ban case.
