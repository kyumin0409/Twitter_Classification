You know this. This is a reminder:

"Or maybe the money itself is unsound, as in Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your balance from yesterday that could‚Äôve bought a house isn‚Äôt worth a cup of coffee today. Monetary systems fail."

--Edward Snowden
Some background: Back in 2013, Wikileaks lawyers shuttled Edward Snowden from the Russian consulate in Hong Kong (where the Russians threw a pizza party for Ed) to Moscow. Any theories about Wikileaks not being a middle-man for the Kremlin and GRU shouldn't be taken seriously.
