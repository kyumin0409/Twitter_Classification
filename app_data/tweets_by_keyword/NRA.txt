@Palmetto_Nole @NRA Okay I will answer exactly what could of prevented these shootings, it'll be multiple replies but you will get your answer, but before I do, can you tell me what could of prevented the shootings. If I can't top your answer then consider your ego, inflated.
@doppelgosling @ProGunMatt @constancevaland @AndrewAsalesman @NRA @MrColionNoir It does. Like it or not. It favors the individuals rights. Might help if you read the federalist papers on 2A mentions.
@40janine @mpleepe58 @NRA And given the above facts, I'm surprised to didn't try to make it about something completely different.

BUT....if you finally learned that your entire frame of mind on guns was and has been wrong and you actually learned something, then just say so instead of walking away.

@Alpha_Liberal @Rondixiedog409 @NRA Funny stuff there  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@csstewart They never asked why in the late 70s the articles began to be written by the gun manufacturers. The beginning of the brainwashing of gun owners. It's why most responsible gun owners left the NRA in the dust.
@politvidchannel I hope everybody gets laid off and the NRA will no longer be. It's a cancer for the country.
@_RainyDayWoman @DLoesch Thank you for your kind reply. 

Obviously, it's not working. 

How about PSAs about safe weapon storage on network/cable TV? Better use of NRA $$ than buying congresspersons, no?

@cwtchcaerdydd @NRA Ok. 

Disagreeing with someone is not the same as dehumanizing them.

That's what you were doing when you acted surprised that someone who likes guns would dissent from the NRA.

@itsonlymoko @williamlegate @glenn_wofford @NRA Well, counter argue it then. Or just be a sheep. I bet you'll do the latter, though.
@Nash076 Ya know, the NRA used to educate people on how not to do this shit before they went insane.

And I bet this guy heard from his friends and family not to carry his gun like that but he was all "DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!"
Or is that Putin funded NRA's long game? The Russian sympathizer/MAGA can't be touched cuz of 2nd Amend. Desensitize us to mass shootings. Normalize AR-15s being seen in public. Putin blows his whistle &amp; we don't know who the bad guys are. Did I make up a new conspiracy theory?

@conniewidman @cdech34 @bschapiroMD @sir_mycroft @smartdissent @NRA Fact 1: There are far more guns in the US than any other developed nation.
Fact 2: The US has a far higher incidence, per capita, of gun murder, accidental gun death and gun suicide than any other developed nation.
@ChrisLoesch @family4christ Is it the position of the NRA that the NFA should be repealed? If the answer is no, then there isn’t really anything to discuss.
@FightTheCensors @ElizabethGmaz No, only those who repeat Putin's "intelligence" agencies' talking points, like:
1) Trump (or right-wing shills &amp; anti-immigrant hysterics like Loomer) are God
2) Brown immigrants or Muslims are bad
3) NRA garbage
etc.

Which you did.

@krassenstein @Fejj_XXV @NRA Spent most of yesterday twitter arguing with gun rights guy, after I pledged my support in a comment to David Hogg.  So no, I haven’t forgotten.  In fact, we should be fighting harder now since we finally have a majority and a chance.  We cannot live our lives constantly afraid.

@ParkerMolloy The NRA Christmas Choir has another soprano.
@gopcrybabies @NRATV @NRA For the most part, they do keep out of politics.  

They are just around for guns.  Support gun rights?  The NRA will support the politician.  Don't support gun rights? The NRA probably won't support you. See how easy that is? It's not a red/blue thing. It is a civil right thing.

@HuffPost The American people, who overwhelmingly support common sense gun laws and assault rifle bans, are now on the hook for payments to mass shooting victims. $16 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of millions the NRA pays to keep the cycle of gun violence going.
@fred_guttenberg The others that were mentioned include, but are not limited to J.D. Gordon, who was in that infamous meeting with Trump, George Papadopolus, and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, John Bolton, who's tied to both the NRA and Cambridge Analytica through his PACs, and KY Gov. Matt Bevin.

@andreafed We had known that KY Gov. Matt Bevin had shown up at an event where Butina spoke. That's been known for some time. But the fact that was at an NRA fundraiser in a year in which he ran for governor (2016) raises questions as to whether or not he was trying to solicit Russian help.

@lisastark351 Ok, now the NRA makes sense; it’s birth control without the added aggravation of women. Interesting twist
@Griffsig1 I used it in the service (US Army, to be precise, 1969-1975.) It is a military style weapon that I don't need to add to my other guns (no rifles). Nor should anyone else. Bumpstock, still out there, despite Vegas. It's my "lane" and that of caring people, which excludes the NRA.

@Pro2ASteve @NRA ...Regulations create a standard to uphold. My kid went to a range down south. They handed her a loaded weapon and sent her out to shoot with minimal instruction. She’d never shot a handgun before. That’s just stupid. Her friend helped her have a great experience that day...

@RepThomasMassie No, it's not. It's also not helpful to say healthcare is a "right". Healthcare for all, while not cheap, just makes sense, like military spending to ensure security for all. Also, it's needed before we can address mental health to reduce gun violence, a favorite trope of the NRA.

@mykotaus I was a conservative until this year. After Parkland, I began observing the NRA and its supporters online. That led me to Trump and his followers. They had a strange detachment from reality. I then observed how he manipulated them - b/c they tune out anything he tells them to.

@nytopinion @michelleinbklyn This is not a normal political world and has not been since McConnell took over.  The GOP and NRA are compromised by Russian investment much in the form of dark money which they love so much.  Must insist on transparency in contributions, NO DARK MONEY!!!!!

@samanthamcgarry An outsider looking in from UK.  We don't have gun problem but lots of other problems of course.  Gun control is essential, no question.  My impression is that if you met a lot of NRA/ gun owners and shot them in the leg - still oppose any gun control.  Love guns ?

Dear @davidhogg111

I woke up with this powerful urge to remind you that the @NRA has not sold a single firearm, before nor after, MSD's Valentine's Day Tragedy.

Since that point however, there have been an estimated 50,000+ defensive gun uses that have saved lives in America.
I wish whenever a crime is committed with a gun involved the law requires police. To report the media:1.Was the gun registered, if so to the criminal2.Was a background check performed on criminal3.Was gun stolen4.Where was gun purchase 5.Was criminal a NRA member. Source of gun.

@t2meg @RepFrenchHill Well, you have Rep. Hill and Sen. Tom Cotton, who has ties to Cambridge Analytica and who's 2014 campaign illegally coordinated with the NRA via OnMessage, and although he hasn't been implicated by reporting to that scheme, AR Gov. Asa Hutchinson is also a client of OnMessage.
@MAC_Arms Yes,  2019 mine and families (4)  will expire and not be renewed @NRA, only keeping @GunOwners memberships.
@LoveDinnington @LouHaigh Why are NRA talking points now crossing the pond? The best protection the PUBLIC has from high powered rifles is that they are not owned even by 'responsible and law abiding people.' The majority of mass shootings in this country and overseas involve legally held weapons.
