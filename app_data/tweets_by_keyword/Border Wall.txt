Trump‚Äôs Border Wall Scoring COLOSSAL Victory In 1 Week - Christmas Came Early! https://t.co/9VCErxKq5c
@JamesOKeefeIII James, so you were behind the video of border crossing on our northern border. Need a northern border wall and more enforcement.  It's sad that there are one-two man checkpoints along the norther border. Of course, the terrain and weather creates a problem.

@Freedom4GenZ The border has never been open. You have to go through CBP at every point of entry. Building a wall is impossible because of the terrain and private land you'd have to buy. Are you ready for a real conversation? Or you only have the same 13 lines draft dodger Trump told you?

@Wrinki13 @Ocasio2018 The wall is a racist symbol. It will do nothing to keep anyone (tunnels, go over, go around, overstay visas) or drugs (delivery by drones). The way to secure the border is technology. More efficient and not so appealing to those who live to hate, so win-win.

BORDER IS DANGEROUS 
DISEASE CONTROL
@OurRevolution The scary thing is the leftish crowd thinking there was going to actually be a physical wall built! It‚Äôs about border policies. Valid security concerns any countries borders. The USA has some of the most open border policies worldwide but these realistic options now seem wrong?
@GWischmeyer @CNN Except you never proved your side, the argument shifted to Trumps idea of a full border wall. Which would be a waste of money at large sections
Trump MUST shut down the government over the Border Wall. Our nations security and sovereignty are both on the chopping block.

Congress do your job.  Border security now.  Fund the wall.
@washingtonpost Wall Street owned Schumer will cave in &amp; please Trump with the border wall because Trump transplanted the American embassy to Jerusalem, thus canceling 2-state peace plan. Schumer voted against the international Iran Nuclear Deal. Schumer first loyalty is to Israel not to USA.

@SenWarren Exactly, I agree again with (Lier) Rep Warren. We should spend more on military and use our troop and resources to build a border wall and put federal troops on our Southern border.
@OurRevolution Of course you are wrong about this.   Let‚Äôs build that wall and protect our southern border.  You want open borders and care more about illegals than than American citizens.  Despicable.

@PrisonPlanet Unfortunately that's what is going to happen unless the wall is built and the border closed!!
Zombies are masses at the border. So what does Congress do? Let's block hiring more judges and sit down to talk about border security and immigration reform.  The time for talk is over.

@NewDay @Acosta The US has a very simple way to fund a wall (or eliminate the need): legalize and tax the 100 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR we send south of the border to pay for illicit drugs.

A wall is not how you control a border!  Why would anyone spend $1 let alone $5 Billion on something that does not work. No matter how you build a wall or how high someone will always build a higher ladder or another way to circumvent it.

There are numerous reports that in the area of the border where the wall was completed, not a single solitary migrant climbed over it.  Or even attempted it.  Walls work.  Period.
@chuckschumer hopefully President Trump shuts the government down unless we the citizens get the 5 billion for funding the border security, wall, etc. it will be your fault and the dems fault if you let this happen.. Shows how ignorant you are.
@Ocasio2018 Money should be added for repairs border patrol and for security. Not the building of an actual wall. I find it so funny Reagan was looked upon as one of the Greatest Republican leaders who got a foreign country to tear down a wall and now republicans want to build one here .
