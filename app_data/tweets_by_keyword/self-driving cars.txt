@StreetsblogUSA @MrMurder37 Exactly. Widening a highway results is slightly shorter period of bumper to bumper traffic. So if there a 5 hour period of traffic jam, from 2:30 to 7:30, it will be reduced to 4h 15m of traffic jam. Assuming exactly the same volume of cars. Self-driving &amp; public transit!!!
