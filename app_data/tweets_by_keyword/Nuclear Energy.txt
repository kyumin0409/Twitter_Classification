@Jon_Star @RadioFreeTom Actually he is correct in this. Nuclear vessels do use steam generators to convert the heat energy into a usable form.
Nobody seems to know this, but wind turbines have a useful life of only 20 years. Coal, gas, and nuclear plants can last for 50 or 60. I'm still bullish on photovoltaics (no moving parts!) but wind is now off my list, probably forever. #energy #wind

@Marlon_Boarnet Large hydro is omitted from https://t.co/qSG2PDRenm renewable statistics, presumably to make the measure meaningful even during drought years. If large hydro is included, 48% of power in CA is renewable, and 56% is non-fossil (ie, incl. nuclear). https://t.co/bQApWvmrq6
@AP @Morning_Joe Intended lifespan of plant is 40 years. 15 of the 58 are 35 years old. 75% off energy from nuclear power now, but plan to lower to 50% &amp; increase wind &amp; solar power. Already have to dispose of rods, so closing plants reduces that waste.

@markcojuangco @GayCarBoys @HeyfromChe @GetUp @mcannonbrookes No it's not apathy when it comes to nuclear energy. People are right to be scared of the long term consequences of disasters like Fukushima &amp; Chernobyl. A nuclear disaster can have devastating effects for generations upon generations. Anyway, why go there if we have renewables?
