PAID SICK LEAVE ‚Äì Effective October 29, 2018, the New Jersey Earned Sick Leave Law allows employees to accrue 1 hour of earned sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 40 hours each year. The law permits employers to create policies that provide additional leave time.

Michigan Senate votes to gut bills increasing minimum wage and requiring paid sick leave https://t.co/zewd3uT3ms https://t.co/Yqo6kyAIo4
based on a 4 weeks paid leave and 5 sick days model, if you convert all 5 weeks into multipurpose leave that gives 25 days paid off a year. If an omegas heat takes 36 days of the year, and weekends are 28.6% of the week, then it's likely that they will only need 25 working days

My work doesn't pay for days off sick so I've lost money this month for the days I had to have off, I've had extra money deducted with no reason why &amp; haven't been paid my new salary. Bearing in mind I get paid minimum wage that doesn't leave a lot left.
