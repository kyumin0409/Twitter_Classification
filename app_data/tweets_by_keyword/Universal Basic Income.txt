Hear a lot about UBI, Universal Basic Income.  I say take the universal part out.  Need to incentivize ppl to join the workforce.  Say UBI is $20K, that approximately $10/hr.  Have the gov guarantee that if a person is working.  Then Small Business could hire at $5/hr.  Total $15
@realDonaldTrump Take it further; change the money system. Bring forward a universal basic income and see real innovation begin. This earth is a waste land, we need to feed the tree and turn the tide to restore life.
@SwiftOnSecurity Welcome to the world of Universal Basic Income were everyone would have enough to eat üôÇ
If you're like, "Why don't we have universal basic income yet?" (Something that shares bipartisan support), the answer is psychological. We worship "work" and "productivity" over leisure and fun. So some people are against UBI because of a false myth that it'll make people lazy.
So in a future where robots do all the work and we have a universal basic income what do we really do with our time?

@MsMelChen 1. Your position is fundamentally flawed. Basic bitches support the status quo. Universal Basic Income represents a significant change from the status quo: it values currently unpaid work, especially work done by caregivers.
I think there is a bigger discussion to be held on universal basic income. One about societal incentive structures. Monetary incentives are just a subset of all possible incentives. They work for 'have'-needs, not for 'be'-needs. They collide with intrinsic motivation factors.

Universal Basic Income - Why/How it is Ideal for Real Motivated People https://t.co/nTaANhoTIU via @YouTube
@WholeLottaRosex @Johnny_Joey Universal basic income doesn't instill a motivation to better one's self. There was no disparaging of those totally incapable of working. If stating that a lack of motivation to get up off your ass &amp; do for yourself is disparaging, you've set the bar extremely low.Socialism sucks
what blows my mind is that apparently nobody is grasping that this is a UNIVERSAL basic income. What's being proposed is a 12k RAISE for whatever your salary is. And if your salary is so big that a 12k bump is nothing, then you're those rich people we're taxing I guess.
All the new work and research re: universal basic income and unconditional cash transfers have made me wonder whether we've always been wrong about not giving money to those who outright ask for it in public

@philipwindever @tonymc39 @graceblakeley @jeremycorbyn @bbcthisweek I think your idea has some merit. A councillor, where I live can receive somewhere around ¬£28,000 depending on their role. Remember this is not a full time job either. I think introducing universal basic income for all citizens would allow more people to get involved in politics.
Yes?
