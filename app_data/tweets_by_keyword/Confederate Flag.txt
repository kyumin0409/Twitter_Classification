@realDonaldTrump Another white racist elected from Mississippi, what a surprise that a state whose flag contains the Confederate Battle Flag would vote for a white racist.
This is the rhetoric of uneducated white folks.  Claiming whites were slaves, the South didn't fight to keep slavery, and the Confederate flag still popular today wasn't the official flag.

When, in ALL historical fact, all 3 things are easily proved wrong. https://t.co/4r8QCsRoBZ

@ashtonpittman @shaunking How is flying the Confederate flag not treason? The üá¨üáßwas flown until the British lost the war, the flag of the Union was üá∫üá∏. Flying the üá¨üáß was treason! When the South LOST the Civil War &amp; not allowed to secede it had to accept the üá∫üá∏ as the symbol of the UNITED STATES!
@Hey_its_Rafa @_SJPeace_ Maybe the VIDEOS reflect that but racism &amp; ignorance isn‚Äôt limited to the age group you mention!
