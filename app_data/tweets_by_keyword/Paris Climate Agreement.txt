@willy04 @I_DO_JUEGOS Then look at what Trump has accomplished in 1/4 of the time Obama was in office... Fucked up health care even more, pushed our closest allies away, removed us from the Paris Climate agreement, started a trade war that may lead us into recession again so on and so on.
Trump is an inept piece of shit yes but it’s unnecessarily disingenuous to A) imply the Paris Agreement implemented radical enough changes to halt climate change 
B) That we got here solely because of the Trump administration this has been decades in the making

@TexasMalloy @DeplorableNetwk @aspfors @GianlucaMezzo Nobody is giving anyone a free pass. The Paris Accords set targets for every country on Earth, including China.

Trump doesn't believe climate change is real, so he pulled out of the agreement. Now the most effective agent for change in the US is sitting on the sidelines.
It’s not any more comforting, or less pessimistic, to know the US is not the only nation failing the world on “meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change”. It’s strange to be observing humanity’s unwillingness to steer away from doom.  https://t.co/pBMmnwOPvs
