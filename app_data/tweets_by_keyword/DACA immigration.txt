If a President can't change immigration laws what the hell is DACA?!?!?!??! https://t.co/ALbaQf8gz8
@CNNPolitics daca was deemed illegal by the supreme court. They said it did not follow the immigration laws. Amnesty was ruled on to they said no to amnesty. 90 percent of illegals in prison have been caught and deported before. 90 percent are on welfare. Tax payers refuse to pay for illegals
@bbusa617 If Democrats stopped resisting and actually worked on immigration laws this wouldn’t be an issue. They love the politics and optics more than the people. Who walked away from DACA deal? Who won’t fund the Wall, Only walking dead I see is Congress doing nothing on this issue.
@citizen4truth1 @JamesMartinSJ Yes. He tied that to limits on LEGAL immigration which even most Republicans opposed.   He wanted to eliminate family reunion, which Democrats were never going to support and he knew it.  Give Dems DACA alone and they'll likely fund the wall. Trump gets greedy.
@CNNPolitics Trump administration just trapped the 9th circuit on Presidential powers and immigration. 
Trumps DOJ will use this ruling against DACA now.
@charliekirk11 Latin American countries do not respect our sovereignty and our laws therefore all immigration from south of our border needs to be stopped, EVERY illegal needs to be immediately deported, DACA needs to be ended, &amp; these people need to be treated as terrorists.
i'm actually against daca &amp; think us trade &amp; immigration laws totally fuck us workers. but gov agents shdnt be allowed to shoot @ ppl for it
@BranwenBarraga2 @miriamjablon @butch16423 @jiveDurkey @safainsapphire ... particularly about immigration reform. We owe something to DACA kids because we said so— it’s only our own word we break, but we do it in full view of the world. Personally, I think the wall is a waste of money &amp; is really just used to pacify... 2
@dbongino Why? Obama rewrote our immigration laws with DACA.
The courts have been failing alright. They have been failing in their duty by being activists in striking down perfectly legal &amp; constitutional acts like rescinding DACA, travel ban etc. citing ridiculous reasons like Trump's campaign words, asylum ban, immigration actions etc. https://t.co/s2Xr0vt9P7

@heartroar17 @MichaelSteele In 2012 Obama violated the constitution &amp; immigration law by putting DACA in place to provide pseudo-legal status to illegal aliens brought to the U.S. as minors,including teenagers with promises of non deportation, work authorizations and Social Security and other benefits.🤨🤨
@BreitbartNews Coming from a man who admitted on The Five that his wife sent their daughter in to vote with him so he wouldn’t vote for his friend Trump. Trump tried to do a immigration bill, was going to give DACA a real shot but the party his wife supports squashed it.
@GeraldoRivera @TheFive Get off your high horse.  I’m in favor of LEGAL immigration. They threw rocks and bottles. Your righteous indignation is misplaced. Should be directed at Congress which failed to accept Trump’s DACA deal and failed to pass immigration reform.
If the Senate Majority is not willing to pass meaningful legislation, including protections for DACA recipients, some sort of immigration package or even an easy bill to protect special counsels, @SenSchumer should absolutely not be promising any funding for an unnecessary wall

@JoGreene1951 @JohnCornyn @politico That's called negotiations. Given that the DACA EO currently violates immigration law, it pretty much levels the playing field. If Democrats were really serious about protecting DACA kids, they'd give Trump his stupid wall but they're not.
@NydiaVelazquez @OversightDems @FEMA_Brock Your the one who voted against the disaster relief bill because the Republicans wouldn’t let the Dems add DACA protections into a bill that had nothing to do with immigration. It seems that you care more about illegal immigrants than your fellow Americans!
@clc3099 @thehill Let’s see. DACA is not ‘law,’ created by EO, @BarackObama and the Ninth Circuit will once again be overruled. Our system is being manipulated &amp; economics alone do not satisfy ‘asylum.’ Something needs to be done to stop unchecked immigration.
@Comparativist Also, this response to her comment is emblematic of why Dems are so squishy on immigration.  Easy enough to condemn family separations &amp; deporting DACA kids, but hard to articulate a view of a coherent system when they can't mention enforcement or limits without being pilloried.
@GeraldoRivera History will judge the @GOP, not all Americans. The #Dems made an offer to #Trump in January 2018 but he refused the compromise b/c he didn't want a deal that included #DACA.

@CNNPolitics 9th circuit says President CAN change immigration law without Congress on DACA (holding DACA in-place).  

9th circuit then says President Cannot change immigration laws without Congress. 

Did Trumps adminstration just trap the 9th circuit and DACA?

Prez Trump should not expect any deal on immigration from Dems. It will be decided in 2020 if he wins &amp; Repubs take back the House. Neither wins are possible though if he gives amnesty to DACA &amp; their parents &amp; the other illegals.

@CBSThisMorning @SenSanders Super misleading (lies). Cannot stand this show. NEVER mentioned that the republicans AND the president offered a comprehensive immigration plan, which included a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. DEMS voted AGAINST it.

@sindhangry @CBSNews Your argument is a completely false dichotomy. The proposition on the table is whether merit-based immigration is better than our current one of anchor babies, DACA, and mass central American immigration. Not immigration vs no immigration.

@hobbit179 @Annie_Rose23 Tell that to Obama who changed immigration policy at will. Example: DACA
The past few weeks and on “this week” the Dems told a complete lie about the border, immigration, and DACA that was offered by @realDonaldTrump which they (Dems) rejected fully. The D’s brought “US” to this point by not coming to the table for a real deal to solve this now.
@GOP @cindyhydesmith Now you should ALL GO IN FOR the TRUMP AGENDA! Get the entire wall funded. Build the wall and get immigration reform DONE! Deport ALL CRIMINAL aliens! Give law abiding self suficient DACA recipients a reasonable offer of citizenship, no adding family members or birth citizenship.
@wearerighter @mitchellvii That is why Trump needs to do immigration policy via Execitive Order.  Trump will NEVER get immigration laws through a Democratic House. Trump needs to do immigration EO just like Obama did DACA and DAPA.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenSchumer Really!With all what is going on, you want to do Criminal Justice Reform?

@rbbb83 @charliekirk11 Believe the lies and rhetoric much? Dems want fair immigration policy and not the deportation of DACA. Nor the deportation of immigrants that served our military. Get your facts straight before repeating the bullshit !!!
@AnnCoulter @IngrahamAngle Ann, contrary to popular belief, Donald Trump is NOT a dictator and so he has to get bi-partisan support to build the wall and fix immigration. He had already presented to fix DACA &amp; build a wall and Dems turned it down. He cannot do it on his own. That's Democracy. He's notObama
This is a pretty good reading on the cause of dysfunction in our immigration policy. 

Recent example, Ds offered up 100% wall funds in order to get a path for the DACA kids, but hardliners killed the deal because they want to use DACA as leverage for limits on legal immigration. https://t.co/TpQ2xtD2b1

@DailyCaller @DailySignal This probably isn't a good example of an activist judge, unlike the judge that ruled against the Pres's EO on DACA. It does however highlight the countries poor immigration laws, which Congress refuses to fix.
@AP by "dealing with immigration" he means deporting DACA recipients and by "dealing with the national debt" he means cutting funding for healthcare coverage for poor children

@JHBoulware @KyleKashuv @nikkihaley The offer was made to address DACA, give them a path to citizenship providing it included funding for the wall. The Dems shot it down. It does no good to reform immigration if there is no way to enforce it because illegals can cross anywhere.

Immigration law needs enforcement,not by wall. No wall in history has been unbreachable. We must have territorial integrity,compassion for asylum-seekers,and prosecution of felons.

@Jacquejacks69 @TerranceMorgan3 @Roxanne181955 @realDonaldTrump Far from trying to run a dictatorship.  He’s trying to actually resolve an issue with immigration that dems refuse repeatedly to fix.  Every immigration bill has had dems voting “nay”.  Even the ones that allowed DACA pathway to citizenship.
@GOP @senatemajldr Not true. 10 years of promised repeal and replace Obamacare was a lie. 10 years of real immigration reform overturning DACA promise another lie. Funding for the wall another lie.
@SenSchumer — NO WALL funding!!! Unless you’re getting a DACA law, a citizenship path for the 11 million undocumented already here, and immigration reform for Mexicans and Central Americans, which includes work visas and a citizenship path, then tell Trump to go fu(k himself.
Funny how a federal judge claims @realDonaldTrump can't rewrite immigration laws yet it was ok for Obama to do just that with DACA

Do u think temporary amnesty for people from El Salvador, or DACA, violates our sovereignty?
@RealJamesWoods @bluhawk7cubed It's NOT @POTUS who's unlawfully changing immigration laws, it's Federal Judges.

1. Judge rules Trump cannot suspend BHO DACA EO, Judge just changed immigration laws.

2. Trump orders asylum seekers to apply at Ports of entry, Judge rules Trump's order violates immigration laws.
@Concerned194567 @thehill @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @CeciliaVega No? You have no interest in the only way illegal immigrants can ever become permanent citizens? Or DACA from getting amnesty? Or any immigration reform at all? Dem politicians dont actually want these things! You dont either?

@theMRC Not surprising CNN supported Obama's use of executive powers to create DACA and oppose Trump's use of those same powers to end it and, that matter, everything else immigration. The use of the liberal courts to stop Trump from exercising his executive authority is the BIGGER issue
@Cooley729 @MatthewJshow @AP I agree with you 100%. Of course Obama should’ve done the same with DACA, which he did not. Not complaining about DACA, but it also needs to be put into an actual law &amp; there needs to be a point in which it stops. We need real immigration reform that includes both topics.
@SenWhitehouse Did you quote a saccharine piece of doggerel when Obama used tear gas dozens of times? 

Why didn’t he fix the immigration issue? 

Why didn’t you vote to accept Trump’s offer to grant citizenship for 2.5 mil DACA?

@JPalmer1967 @vickimoore @KnowDeplorables @Ocasio2018 WRONG. Trump campaigned on a wall and doing something about illegal immigration. Both houses of congress failed.

@whitewalkers348 @MeepsLil @PittMom16 @Java702 @GKeile @LoriAMooreKY DACA was not attempting to change immigration laws by subverting a condition for application for asylum, it was attempting to create a path to correct a unique situation. Case law is about interpretation, any reasonable Justice knows the 9th is correct under the current laws.
@WhiteHouse The bottom line: You've had nearly 2 years of control of Congress &amp; WH to develop a new immigration bill with requirements, quotas, path to citizenship for DACA,etc. but HAVE DONE NOTHING. Congress develops legislation, not handing out blank checks.
@ameseh I thought it might be in exchange for DACA or immigration reform but it turnsout those are really popular and there isn't a need to compromise.
@workthegooery @Bill_Ted_resist @realDonaldTrump I would agree but if all that the dems want to do is obstruct how can there be a conversation? They won't even slightly bend nothing at all so there can be no bipartisan anything! Republicans offered a sweet deal on daca and on immigration reform I'm trade for the wall but Noooo!

@Mimothekitten @Elizabe32086198 @IvoryDove @RMConservative @Bro69Gender Agreed, but please note: none of these were EOs. DACA and DAPA were DHS policy changes, and Trump's asylum proclamation is just that--a proclamation. There are various types of executive actions, and EOs are just one of them.

@SenSchumer PASS A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION LAW. NO TO AMNESTY NO TO CITIZENSHIP NO TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTION NO TO DACA NO TO DREAMERS GIVE THEM WORKING PERMIT ONLY. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MUST NOT AVAIL OF ANY OF OUR RESOURCES.WE HAVE SO MUCH HOMELESS &amp; STARVING SENIORS &amp; FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP

So, the judge also just old us that Obma's DACA is illegal. Trump should immediately start rounding up and deporting all those "protected" by the illegal order.

@TimmyGozux @TopRopeTravis @BetoORourke I disagree with his immigration policy.  Secure the border so that people cannot cross as easily as they do now.

@RobsoxV @dbdMAr @LadyRaven3 @Manny13z @realDonaldTrump @GM The ultimate legal authority for DACA lies in the Constitution.Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution  President “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Carrying out our immigration laws involves deciding who should be targeted for deportation and who stays.

@dianasloan80401 @pattirod55 @womensmarch @maria22616896 If you think DACA should be seen as a violation, the authority for it came from Reagan's Simpson-Mazzoli Act, so that's his doing, too.

Illegal immigration grows when the US is doing well, and Mexico is doing less well.

Can't fix that, without uniting across the border.

@realDonaldTrump We have left-wing activist judges interpreting immigration cases based on the belief the DACA is federal law.

It's NOT. It's an illegal EO by Obama NOT law.

@ValuesCommon @nathanawalter @brianshall @JoyceChaplin1 @WatsonInstitute @BrownUniversity Untrue.

Earlier this year, 63% of Americans said they would legalize #DACA recipients in exchange for Trump’s 4-pillar immigration reform, including a merit-based system, border wall funding, elimination of the visa lottery, and E-Verify. 2/3rds said illegal aliens should be sent home. https://t.co/SZ9Wa0EPNA

Build the wall. No citizenship for DACA. No anchor babies. No visa lottery. E-Verify. Monitor visa overstays. No chain migration. Punish countries not taking their people back. No benefits to illegals.  Merit based immigration only. Do it now.
I love when Trump says he's grateful Hillary isn't POTUS.

I used to be @GOP, but I voted for Hillary.

If she'd won I am willing to bet (even with a @GOP congress) that we'd already have the following:

@Meg_WritesStuff @RepJaredPolis Let's fix it in a humane way.  Once people cross the border they are our problem. A border wall, A DACA fix that legalizes dreamers and a change to the immigration system with a robust guest worker program where people can work here and return to their families.
@MuellerSheWrote @realDonaldTrump Pass permanent immigration reform. Also include granting law abiding DACA recipients a path to citizenship.  End chain migration.  Fully fund and build wall and CLOSE THE DAMN BORDER TO NON VISA CARRYING MIGRANTS!

There is something for all Americans.
This is on top of the $1.6 billion the Democrats are already offering in exchange for protection of DACA recipients. If he agrees to all of it his vanity project would be fully funded, and we would have a more functional and more humane immigration system.

18. But DACA is ensnared in numerous federal lawsuits, and will be long past Dec. 7. That’s when Congress must approve spending for the Homeland Security Department, which is in charge of border security and immigration enforcement. (That is, CBP and ICE.)
@RonWyden What’s your fix? Again,we hear a lot of talking and no action on #Immigration and CBP. #DoYourJob and fix this immigration problem and you want have people being held in the first place.This tweet shows how ineffective you are on this.Get DACA and build the wall @realDonaldTrump
So @POTUS44 can write Immigration law #DACA and it legal  but @POTUS can put a simple ban in place? There is some special kind of stupid people out there.
@ValentineShow can you give some perspective on this hypocrisy?
Permanently CLOSE the border until Congress passes immigration reform, a DACA solution, and border wall funding that are all acceptable to Trump and the American citizens. If it takes years?? So be it. It’s Congress’s fault.

I should take one thing back about no policy wins—we did get DACA. But let’s not forget how we got that and maybe apply those lessons to how we rethink immigration. DACA came after years of the Obama administration *and* much of the immigrant rights movement shushing Dreamers.

Obama was horrible and tougher on immigration until he realized the human factor which led to DACA. 

Open borders dems my ass.
Obama deported  MILLIONS!
@KamalaHarris If congress would have work w/ @POTUS on immigration/building the wall the troops may not have been needed. I seem to remember how generous he was willing to be w/ DACA. D’s refused to come to the table. So if you’re blaming anyone you might want to look at yourself &amp; colleagues.

All of a sudden the Democrats are WORRIED ABOUT NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW? where the h*ll we're they when Obama said DACA would never hold up in the Supreme Court? Where were they when the IMMIGRATION LAW WERE IGNORED? Where are they when a city refuses to turn over illegal Criminals
@pito197 @marilyn_yadira @realDonaldTrump Jose u r buying into liberal propaganda. Trump offered all DACA individuals a path to citizenship. I and most conservatives supported the offer. Dems turned it down as a political move. They r using immigrants for political jockeying. Conservatives support ‘legal’ immigration.
@CalmTomb @KevinMKruse If Schumer gives trump some money for his dumbass wall but gets DACA into law without changes to legal immigration numbers, it’s a win.
Human misery is the foundation of #Democrat power!

Hence the reason #Obama did not fix #DACA or #Immigration issues when he had the presidency and both houses for two years!

Without poverty and misery to use as a platform, the Democrats have no voters!
