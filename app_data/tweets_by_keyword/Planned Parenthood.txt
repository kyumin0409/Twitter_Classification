@ZestyLefty @PhilandEarl @Anvesaka88 @LillChristopher @Joshp50 @glkitty @bradenpace @NehiMomma @imillhiser Dedicated clinics like Planned Parenthood who is tax funded, spends millions in every election and kills babies. Right. If Democrats would get out of the healthcare industry everything would be a free market giving us better products for a cheaper price.

@BlueMoonBright1 Planned parenthood wants women to have control over their reproductive destinies and to have ever child a WANTED child.

@gingerbev67 @HuffPost MP cutting off Planned Parenthood and not authorizing needle exchanges does not cause HIV. Sharing needles or having sex with HIV positive people does.

Planned Parenthood offers support for men's health as well. If a man chooses to have a vasectomy &amp; never have children. That is his decision, women don't have a say. As it should be.
