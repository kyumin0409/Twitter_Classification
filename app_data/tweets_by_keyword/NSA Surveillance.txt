But the NSA is just another apparatus of the surveillance state whose ultimate goal is white supremacy.
@JohnBrennan You &amp; your underhanded malicious role in setting up @realDonaldTrump for NSA surveillance, illegal opposition research, &amp; the coordinated lying campaign of "Russian Collusion". Mueller is already scorned by history for purposely keeping FBI off 9/11. You're a national disgrace.
