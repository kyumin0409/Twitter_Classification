@ajplus @Mediaite As a person of middle eastern descent, the notion that only Israel or Jews are Semitic is in itself anti-Semitic. By firing @marclamonthill for exercising his first amendment rights @CNN has used the same hypocrisy demonstrated by POTUS to silence the opinions of opposition.

@FDRLST If twitter left posts and posters alone it could be a Platform. But since it censors different groups of people it is a Publisher.  First amendment rights should apply.
@Yamiche These rules defy everything the First Amendment intended. I imagine all members of the news media and their corporations are suing to get these rules thrown in the trash.

@freedom_moates But, is Twitter a publisher? Or a public medium? If they are a publisher, they have the right to edit, and deny access. If a medium, they have to abide by the first amendment.
In short, the government can no more discriminate against a publisher for failure to be "neutral" than for any other point of view. 

A push for enforced neutrality is a push for forced messaging. And it is antithetical to First Amendment values.
