@jildelaine @PattyMurray There is a lot of misinformation about the ObamaCare (ACA) out there.   But the truth is, until ObamaCare if you had a pre-existing condition you were stuck in your job forever, afraid of losing health insurance.
@senatemajldr Was that Obamacare?
@thebradfordfile he once gave a great 'speech' about how much $$ Obamacare would cost us all - and he was right.  Then, however, he joined Romney in a failed election and he's appeared to be useless since then.  I'm bummed about it, TBH. I was a big fan.
@exiledbravesfan I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô, before Obamacare, my insurance was quoted around $550/mo. Like most normal people, I realized how absurd that was and chose to not have insurance. Guess who‚Äôll be stuck paying my medical bills from 2008-‚Äò15? Taxpayers. It‚Äôll be a lot more than had I had coverage.

@washingtonpost Every @GOP "fix" for Obamacare is really just a subterfuge to destroy it.  Even after the shellacking they took in the midterms, it seems that Republicans will never abandon their obsession with denying affordable &amp; comprehensive coverage to every American who cannot afford it.

@NYStateofHealth Because of your nightmare system, I‚Äôm going into yet another month without coverage. I‚Äôve been trying since the end of October. If I get hit be a car next month, I‚Äôll be wiped out financially &amp; I‚Äôll blame you. #obamacare #incompetent
@O2supply @itscollmc @GOP @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Say that to the ppl who‚Äôs lives were saved because of that bill. It‚Äôs unofficially called ObamaCare &amp; you know that. 

Personally, I think it should be renamed to the Barack Hussein Obama Healthcare bill. But that‚Äôs just me.
@JanMueller @BernieSanders So I guess I would agree on a single payer system too. I just thought it would be like our current "ObamaCare" where everyone is forced to get health insurance through a provider thus creating alot more profit for those companies and driving up the cost of insurance for the rest.

Many families joined Obamacare b/c they were forced to. Once they were no longer forced to pay $20k/year for a ridiculous plan with a $10k deductible, they dropped the insurance. Much cheaper to pay cash straight to a doctor.

@ABC it's because trump repealed obamacare insurance protections, keeps trying to limit/stop medicare/medicaid, and makes dents in social security. he's a daft bastard &amp; needs to stop.
@Bummie62 @Cooper19874 @CNN Did that stop GOP from ramming through judges? Nope. Did that stop GOP from cutting taxes for the rich and driving up the national debt? Nope. 

If Trumplicans had any alternative for Obamacare, they could have rammed it through also. They had NONE.

@exclamaShawn @SarahPalinUSA I have severe RA. After Obamacare literally broke me, I lost my doctors and now becoming destitute I too pay nothing as I qualified for Medicaide as my biologics cost nearly 30 grand a month. Didn't work so now I live on shitty prednisone.

@cjlovesamerica Oh sweetie...Obama hasn't been President for a couple years.   Trump has had control of the Executive, Legislative and now Judicial branches.  Sounds like you are using Obama as an excuse for Trump's failures.  He hasn't repealed Obamacare or passed any immigration reform.

@JeffFlake Every time you tak a ‚Äújab‚Äù at Trump ... you hit the American people instead.  Just like McCain did on Obamacare ... legacy lost. But we now know why McCain did it (up to his neck in Russia-gate), what‚Äôs your excuse?
@repmarkpocan Thanks to the ACA and obamacare premiums have skyrocketed. That's why it's so important we dissolve the ACA and get back to a free market in healthcare.
What Trump did so far ü§î
- Arrest Pedophiles
- Downs nukes (Hawaii)
- Avert Agenda 21
- Gives record Employment
- Purge FBI, CIA, NSA, RNC
- Dump Obamacare, Iran Nuke, Paris climate
- End 60 yrs Korean war
- Help demolishing ISIS in Syria
All of this will be dangerous for Trump
