Dear @CDCgov,

Your 39 question required evaluation for my first of 15 or so mini classes on vaccines is a little CUMBERSOME!  
It‚Äôs hard to take that many questions seriously. 

Sincerely,
-Your friends who love vaccines too.
@canadian_spider Absolutely it is, zero argument there.

When it was in vaccines IIRC it was stably bound in a way that kept it from being able to be poisonous to humans (but kept mold from growing in the vaccine).

Idk what happened to it after it left our bodies, tbh, but there‚Äôs none now.
@KayFellowz And obviously mandating vaccines is a bad idea because there are legitimate reasons against giving them in some cases, besides religious objections. That's why we go for herd immunity. As for your socialism remark: we already know what kind of person you are, calm down.

@Andreaowoodruff Can you think of anything else in medicine that's viewed like vaccines are?
And the crazy part is the same companies that make vaccines have paid billions in fraud settlements for misrepresenting other drugs. &amp; they enjoy liability protection for pediatric vaccines. Defies logic.

People seem to think vaccines carry no risks... yet there are legit reasons parents don't vaccinate their kids and most of the time it's because their kids are vaccine injured. Also vaccines contribute  to the spread of illnesses because some are live virus vaccines.
@_C_Callaghan @CElliott71109 @potsiegirlsarah @AllysonWendt @businessinsider On "Last Week Tonight," John Oliver did a deep dive into vaccines just last year. The entire segment is free for viewing on YouTube, so you don't need HBO to watch it.

@grant_freedom @heron313 @MemesRight Vaccines are not proven to have any link to autism beyond a correlation at best. And correlation does NOT equal causation. 

Furthermore I am not forcing anything. I'm stating my stance and expressing what I know and what others know.

Not vaccinating is dangerous and that's fact
It's now edgy to say "vaccinate your kids"

No you know what fuck you. Polio is back because of morons who think Vaccines are bad or that autism is something so horrendous you'd rather risk a person contracting life threating and changing illness. Get to absolute fuck

@davidhogg111 Do we get a choice exemption for full autos like we allow choice exemption from vaccines?
@newishness I'm not arguing against that. The problem is all children are given all regular vaccines unless they have a previously diagnosed condition. None of them are screened to help prevent adverse reactions

@DJ_247_96 That‚Äôs not totally correct. All vaccines contain a deactivated form of the virus they are trying to protect you from.

@ReggieBush I have 3 kids, all unvaccinated, all healthy, vibrant and intelligent. Check out Dr. Chris Exley's study of autistic brains. He found they were LOADED with aluminum and it was intracellular. Aluminum is a potent neurotoxin. And it's only 1 of the ing that make vaccines so deadly.

German: flu vaccine shortage. Among the factors considered for explaining the situation: this year, doctors have limited as much as possible pre-orders of vaccines (to limit the financial risk they would bare if some vaccines are not used) https://t.co/cusX1WKwtw
@EMIMDoc here is a question. Immunity comes from exposure to an acute viral (or other microbe) infection right? We fight it off and then learn how to more easily fight it off in the future.

And vaccines are the same but we are fighting off a harmless variant of the virus right?
@JG_SOCCER18 @Chena_Punim @mitchsunderland @Cernovich So your kid's vaccines didn't work then, eh?
Why Vaccines are important; familiarity.

A vaccine is a dead or weakened form of a virus, which teaches your body to recognise, remember and prepare for a wild form. Its this that means you can win the fight much more easily, which for some means life and death, not a day off.

@KayFellowz I also haven't seen anyone attack you, don't pretend to be a victim.  You knew what you were saying was controversial, that's why you prefaced it the way you did. Everyone is saying the exact same thing: vaccines work. I've seen no one attack you, come on..don't be such a victim
To all the anti vaxxers in the world: correlation does not equal causation. Stop trying to say that life saving vaccines kill people or give kids autism. It‚Äôs incorrect and it‚Äôs sad you‚Äôd rather have diseases like polio back rather than parenting an autistic kid

Utilitarian: Everyone should get the flu vaccine to prevent its spread, protecting the greatest amount of people.
Rights-based: People have the basic right to choose for themselves what vaccines they receive.
even if this illness didn‚Äôt pop up because of lack of vaccinations like some are speculating, it‚Äôs still important to vaccinate your kids!! there are so many awful illnesses that are popping back up just because some people think vaccines are dangerous

Honestly, people who refuse to get vaccines for themselves or their kids should be fined. Endangering your community like that is something you should be punished for. Just saying...
-for the flu shot, even if you get the flu, the vaccination greatly decreases the risk of the actual illness

@jotunar @TheJulieBenson Kids in the US are recommended (CDC) to get 72 doses of vaccines by age 18. No adults are vaccinated with that schedule, it's expanded 3x since the 80's. They are mandated for kids based on herd immunity... but if the adults aren't immune, that theory is garbage.
@DrAdrianHarrop some of these allergy problems prompted by vaccines are conditions that lead to lifelong disability &amp; early death.  The doctors make no effort whatsoever to even measure the long-term effects of their experiments, which they perform on the population at large.

@YaketyYakumo Do you know what is included in vaccines? Do you know what the binding ingredients are? Do you know how many vaccines are given today versus the ones that were given in 1983? If you don't know these answers, you should research them.
Similar things happen with gmos, and  in some places even with vaccines... This the proof that current education is failing. We must teach people science and increase their literacy. Any grown up living in this information age MUST be able to discern real science from blatant BS. https://t.co/Zn4hxfbnUg

@espiers Restrictions on drunk driving are probably a better analogy for vaccines than seatbelts. If someone doesn‚Äôt wear a seatbelt, the damage is likely limited to themselves. If someone doesn‚Äôt vaccinate, the worst damage may be imposed on others, who have no way to protect themselves.
First things first; vaccines are among the safest medical products available and prevent the cost of having an infectious disease. The potential risks associated with the diseases that vaccines prevent are much greater than the potential risks from the vaccines themselves.

@KayFellowz I'm a scientist. I don't need a kid to understand how vaccines and the immune system work.   You could reproduce like an FLDS sister-wife and it won't make you understand either.  Now go vaccinate your fucking kid(s).
@ChileeePlease @UKnowWhat2Do @NBCNews It's not that those opposed to vaccines don't want their children to be safe, they just want their children to be safe from harmful inoculations.
There are plenty of us out there that have or are close with someone who has had adverse reactions.
@ChelseaClinton @TheNoon11 @washingtonpost No just no. If I get vaccines and one person can infect everyone then why the fuck am I worried. Just release smallpox already and get it over with.

@NeonNettle Strikes between august and October when kids get their back to school mandatory vaccines! CDC won't look at that! Most if not all have been recently vaccinated!
@Cain10414291 It seems very unlikely that it is always completely safe to be injected with supposedly inert pathogens just because it does act as a vaccine. Some are clearly very safe but to extent that dogmatically over ALL vaccines as a matter of ideology is moronic.
@malkabethwendy Oh no, I rely on doctors to an extent as well. I had cancer and need follow up's on a regular basis. I think in some ways doctor's are absolutely amazing. In other ways, like vaccines, progress needs to be made.

The one thing most people forget about #vaccines is that the success on the vaccine depends mostly on, ironically, the strength of the immune system. Weak immune systems means weak responses. Immune systems are built through a strong gut and digestion of foods.

Biologically they are, yes. Vaccines have an additive called Aluminum Hydroxide- if you inject the same amount into a mouse, the nose will die. Antibiotics kill bad and good cells in the body. https://t.co/4g0C4dGc6P

@ETBowden @soledadobrien That's an argument *for vaccination*. Yes, children may have a reaction to a vaccine though this is very rare. Since they can't be vaccinated, it's critical for everyone else to have it.
