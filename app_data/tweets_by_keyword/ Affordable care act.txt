Don’t think health insurance is trash? 

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act tax credit and the fact I don’t make much means I can get insurance $70 a month/$840 a year.

If I make a few thousand more a year I’ll have to pay $581 a month/$6,972 a year.

What does this all mean?

Federal Subsidies Could Expand to Health Programs That Violate Obamacare The Trump administration encouraged state officials to seek waivers

than required by the Affordable Care Act.  https://t.co/YBDt4oKSFQ
Trump keeps chipping away at the ACA. Now he’s allowing the Federal dollars that were supposed to be paid ONLY to accepted ACA plans to be paid to plans that are outside the ACA. Those plans are skimpy and cover way less than ACA plans.🤬🤬🤬

@SenKamalaHarris The Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, is not affordable. Government run healthcare puts bureaucrats in charge of medical care, making it far more expensive than individuals making their own healthcare choices with the guidance of their doctors.

A Federal District Court judge in Texas will soon issue a decision in the lawsuit brought by 20 states and supported by the Trump Administration (all Republicans) to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act.

Overturned citizens United
Limited Gerrymandering
Revived Fairness Doctrine

He was a unifier not a divider.

He was the 1st black president. And yes that’s a big deal.

He started the Affordable Care Act which helped low income households and people with pre-existing conditions.
@SenBlumenthal I thank President Obama for having the courage to introduce the Affordable Care Act.  And this creepy president wanted to repeal it with no replacement in place.  This president hasn't gotten the slightest clue how people that weren't born with a silver spoon live.
@EdwardTHardy Mostly because he stuck his neck out for the Affordable Care Act. And the Repugs drummed their base up to a frenzy. My God, affordable health care....what could be worse?

Affordable Care Act—

The 2019 Open Enrollment has started, running to Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018. If you don't act by then, you can't get 2019 coverage unless you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. Plans sold during Open Enrollment start Jan. 1, 2019.

@realDonaldTrump You are truly a horrible person. Your new rules are further underming the affordable care act giving everything to insurance co’s and NOTHING to consumers. Obama cared. You do not.
Nancy Pelosi helped America achieve a progressive high-water mark as an invaluable partner to Obama with the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, Dodd Frank, Lilly Ledbetter, Student Loan reform &amp; the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell repeal, in an affirmation of our values. #ImWithNancy https://t.co/vp3Ss8lGKv
@jewelofjkt @CLG_PNW @Ocasio2018 Except that's not in her favor either, because I pointed out that Pelosi allowed the Affordable Care Act to be watered down by Republicans who explicitly told her they intended on making sure Obama was a one-term President which meant denying any political wins whatsoever.
