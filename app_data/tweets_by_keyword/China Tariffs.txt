@realDonaldTrump Degree in Economic Science? China is not paying your tariffs. Nor is any other country. Your USA based importers pay the Tariff when they import foreign goods. You are taxing your own citizens. You know this an you continue to lie to Americans.

How Tariffs Work, and Why China Won‚Äôt See a Bill - https://t.co/SeTMvhGOkf #LatestComments
@realDonaldTrump PLEASE get someone to explain tariffs to you! China doesn‚Äôt pay the US money! Tariffs are paid by the consumer with higher prices. Importers pay the tariff then pass on the cost to the consumer. American consumers are paying the tariffs. THAT is how tariffs work, you idiot!

The exporter pays the tariff to the importer (vice versa). China exports far more to the US than we export to them. They were subsidizing their businesses to protect them, but no longer can. Therefore, they are taking the blunt of the hit. Crashing economy.

It's no wonder you don't understand why tariffs are a bad idea if you don't realize that it increases costs to Americans.

Tariffs are paid by the importer (US consumers/manufacturers) not by the exporter (i.e.China). Only "cost" to China is if the tariffs cause buyers to change suppliers. Increased revenue cited by POTUS is a tax.@juliemason #trade #tradewar
@cullenroche Forget practice, the initial US tariffs focused on imported electronics (Chinese producers absorbed 80% via price cuts). US exports to China are limited (Grain exporters saw a spike in exports prior to tariffs, and are now storing excess). US is winning for now, but we‚Äôll see.

Does anyone really believe the Chinese will give up 10s of million manufacturing jobs willingly for our sake?  The very essence of China is industrial might. It is an obsession with China.    Prediction: No fix can come any negotiations.  Tariffs not talk. https://t.co/kVFkhsX9OB
RT @IonaCwk: @intheMatrixxx @POTUS Are HRC and China working together to try a "deadly" squeeze on our President to lower Tariffs?
Total lies as usual. Tariffs are not paid by importers, they are paid by Americans paying more for goods coming in. The billions of $ are an extra tax on Americans that hurt GDP. @cnn @maddow @abc @cbs @nbc

@realDonaldTrump China's communist government has imposed high tariffs on imports, making them prohibitively expensive to sell at home. Ordinary people simply can't afford it. But the consumer demand for imported goods has always been great, so there are all kinds of fake imported goods in China.
It‚Äôs important not to underestimate the degree to which the Trunp administration‚Äôs crises are if their own making. Tariffs pushed manufacturers to shift abroad. Foreign emoluments box them in on Yemen and Ukraine, not to mention China, Iran, North Korea.
