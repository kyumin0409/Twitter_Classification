Obama did everything he could to slow down, if not stop, oil production in the United States. His administration cut back the amount of federal land available for shale oil production and blocked oil exploration in Alaska. Federal drilling permits were also delayed.
.@BarackObama - dude - the increase in oil production was at a STATE level, not federal (you had NOTHING to do with it). On a federal level, you shut down drilling on federal land, did nothing on Keystone, added hundreds of pages to compltete a permit...

Just stop it.... https://t.co/92jtJoQZEr
#PointLoma has "multi-bagger" return potential from its Banff and Rex oil plays, and the #Duvernay shale oil resource play.

@HarryLovero @realDonaldTrump The price of oil is determined by Middle East players, pure and simple. If he had that control he could raise the price per barrel back where oil companies are rehiring people laid off over the last 3 years &amp; prompt exploration &amp; drilling. So he has NOTHING to the price of gas.
Wouldn't want to upset Saudi Arabia, now. Then they might threaten to withhold oil from us (the U.S., the undisputed champion of oil drilling, imports 1 million barrels a day from the Saudis), then we'd have to beg them for more, like always. https://t.co/30I22eX0UY https://t.co/VLYw8xxEZy
