@ScottMorrisonMP A full ban on Islam Immigration is required. Costs taxpayers and our deficit millions of dollars with Islam counter-terrorism, de-radicalisation programmess, extra security at public events, "diversity" bollards. welfare, social services, crime, tax-free Halal Certification.

@MercilessIndian Should we ban immigration?
It’s a one-two punch with the Asylum Ban; end asylum for those crossing the border, then make it so that people asking for asylum at Ports of Entry can’t apply. They have weaponized broad grants of power in immigration law with the goal destroying immigration law as it stands.

@halaljew I used to think this, but consider that the wall (probably necessarily) precedes an overall travel ban. Even if it serves little purpose under present conditions, it gives the fascists the infrastructure they need to eventually shut down immigration completely

With the terrorist attack we just had in Melbourne, the security guard who was stabbed was a Muslim. We need to ban Islam immigration now. It is equally as much to protect Muslims living here in Australia now, from being killed from terrorist attacks, as it is non-Muslims. https://t.co/UNPsdwYVjK
@freddyatton @realDonaldTrump The first (INCORRECTLY labeled a muslim travel ban)/last two were all things the Obama admin participated in. We can then state that Obama's supporters approved. As for DACA @POTUS has authority over immigration. I approve of those policies which are for the good of the nation.
Obama's DACA EO literally rewrote the law and nobody challenged it.

Trump's asylum ban EO literally upholds an enforced immigration law (and adheres to the Supreme Court decision on the travel ban) and it's shot down.

This "judge" is no more distinguished than a paid protestor.
He is using immigration to politically satisfy his ignorant racist base because he's done nothing else he promised except racism i.e. Muslim Ban, White Nationalism &amp; this which he created. His evil ass would rather shut down the border than have them legally apply for asylum. /2

@gail_deterra Wrong ! An temporary induction was based on interpretation of law - it wasn’t overturned...... They blocked his immigration ban too - and he won easily at the Supreme Court.
Except everyone knows that a proportion of judges are simply not independent and do try to legislate from the bench. Point in fact that the Supreme Court recently overturned on the immigration ban...... https://t.co/EPgQWlz0G5

@ScottMorrisonMP With the terrorist attack we just had in Melbourne, the security guard who was stabbed was a Muslim. We need to ban Islam immigration now. It is equally as much to protect Muslims living here in Australia now, from being killed from terrorist attacks, as it is non-Muslims.
We’re in front of Schumer’s office now demanding NO ban, NO wall, NO raids! No $$$ for a corrupt immigration enforcement system! https://t.co/D1hHwRcX24

@ClayTravisJewBe @bariweiss Good question.  Yes is the answer though you would have to not call it a Muslim Ban. However we suspect bad faith and homophobia on behalf of Trump because of his rhetoric.  But on its face yes.  Say for example if after 9/11 we decided to halt immigration from Saudis Arabia.

@LevequeThots @RodStryker Islamophobia is a false charge like racism that Liberals use for anyone who doesn't subscribe to far left ideologies. If we reduce immigration and refugees, FGM will continue to dwindle. 

Thankfully Trump has massively reduced the flow of refugees but Sudan isn't under the ban

@Atrios And for that reason they believe Trump’s a clown who can be beaten by a generic Democrat on a platform of partial wall funding. I rarely see discussions about how the Muslim ban, immigration crackdown, SCOTUS appointments, and tax cuts will bring out the Republican base in 2020.
@HarviliczTammy @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump The border should be secured by any means. I have zero sympathy for the criminal colonists! Legal immigration starts at an embassy. Crossing the border illegally should ban you from citizenship or residency for life the first offense. No amnesty and no exceptions!
