@RLong_Bailey @chunkymark Banning fracking's what the SNP has already done in power. The SNP has legislated to contribute to reducing global warming. The SNP hasn't passed on the bonus tax reduction to high earners that Labour didn't oppose.

@IsraelUSAforevr @TheTestyTarheel Actually, it was because of newer technology called ‚Äúfracking‚Äù - combined with high oil prices that made ‚Äúfracking‚Äù cost effective to produce and pump oil and natural gas. Nice try though. It certainly wasn‚Äôt because of Obama, Bush, or even Trump.

Hi @GrayConnolly, I like your articles and respect your views on conservatism. As such, I seek your opinion on 1. whether a "true" Liberal/conservative can be concerned about climate change (man made or otherwise) and 2. Whether a "true" Lib/cons has to support fracking.

@tomselliott Obama has lost his mind! He destroyed the coal industry. Tried to regulate fracking out of existence. No to Anwar. And he has judges saying no to the pipeline. Truly amazing!
@DailyCaller @BarackObama Hey Obama, you didn‚Äôt open up Alaska to drilling in fact you blocked it or the Keystone pipeline or fracking or coal industry! You cannot take credit for industries that you destroyed and @realDonaldTrump brought back to life!

@gnvrbyd @CollardJosianne @MarkRPellegrino @AprillePark @TeresaRJ3 Additionally, when old industries move into new territories, like fracking here in PA, they have to learn how to handle our unique environmental conditions and legacy issues. They're used to working in a different environment, and sometimes techniques don't transfer over well.

@CNN I had to raise my children while suffering from severe depression over government negligence on the climate crisis. I'll never forgive Obama and Clinton for the fracking. What a horrible thing to have done at that time.
