@SimonInAus @carldsmart @LyleShelton Would you accept a Religious Freedom Act which enabled faith-based institutions to employ only people who upheld its ethos? If not, you are preventing the exercise of religious freedom which is our Constitutional right (as well as a fundamental human right).

@karisfilion @JimLittle1 @tripleoxymoron @johnpauldickson The analogy with politicians &amp; their freedom to 'discriminate' highlights the #hypocrisy of those who'd deny this freedom to faith-based institutions.
