I can send my kids to a public university with in-state tuition at a fraction of the cost than it costs UK citizens in taxes. With a 3.0 GPA and 1100 on SATs they'll get 75% paid for in FL. Meanwhile, we don't have to siphon large amounts of money from our economy
Most public universities offer signficantly lower tuition for in-state students.

A new Texas bill says "no"--considering DACA recipients are neither citizens nor legal residents.
