@pon_de_rhianna Except no proposed gun control measure would stop mass shootings (see wapo article). Also, guns are used hundreds of thousands of times in self-defense every year ‚Äî more times then they‚Äôre used in crimes, actually.

@LittleBlueDotTx @NRA For the violence you seem to be complaining about, the vast majority of it is concentrated 5% of the country; all of which are locations with heavy handed gun control.

@gun_control_ca In most provinces, if not all, its illegal to hunt with a .223 (5.56√ó45mm NATO). 

....and by hunt I mean deer and bigger.
Exactly... If the NRA and Pro gun lobby is so confident that we need more guns not gun control, let the Center for Disease Control study gun violence. https://t.co/iFbwdJVMce
@Neoavatara I think this is a sneaky smart move. Anyone who is knowledgeable about guns knows this will change nothing and they have no need to be concerned, while proponents of gun control, who know nothing about guns, will find themselves compelled to give Trump some credit on the issue.

@BlairDMckee @RealSaavedra It actually does not require a bump-stock to bump-fire a semiauto rifle. You can do it with your belt loop. You can even do it without anything but your finger, if you do it right. Banning bump-stocks is an empty act that, like most other gun control measures, will not work.

There have been a few opinions about "reasonable restrictions," made by the Supreme Court, but those opinions are bunk legal theory, because the Feds already establish what is reasonable, and that power is theirs to wield, so state-by-state "gun control" is illegal.

@Newsweek I think if we had more time this whole gun control thing would take care of itself....just sayin
Trust me I love the message of gun control, but in the U.S. where the far-right is rising and gun control has historically been used to disarm minorities (regan w/ CA black panthers) it would only affect minorities. Gun control can only work in an equal, non-capitalist society

@Max_Bakers @davidwlilly @FuckThe_NRA That may be the case but the consequences of prohibition are lessons of history.
The examples of gun control borne out by my country (Britain) and Australia prove my point. Fewer guns, fewer gun incidents. Simple logic.

@DJVoisey @EllyDavis @LouHaigh But your argument that legally owned firearms do not end up on the streets is inaccurate.

Even in the UK a large proportion of guns used in crimes start off as legal guns and are then stolen.

Strict gun control laws are important which is why this decision is shocking.

@IvanTheTroll12 @KyleKashuv That isn't what I said at all. First, they ARE ridiculous and every other gun enthusiast I know has said the same. Second, they're dangerous in that the weapon becomes hard to control and it provides rapid fire at a similar rate to full auto and should be regulated the same.
@luscombeland Yes, 65% are suicides, i.e not preventable by gun control. People don't kill themselves because they have guns, they kill themselves because they have severe depression. Let's not pretend suicide rates would go down if guns were harder to get.
@mbaharaeen Agreed! Exactly the right set of issues to start with. Then climate, infrastructure, gun control, fair wages, antitrust...
Support for gun control is a policy that directly takes away political power from the people and gives it to the state. We should desperately resist any form of gun control as a direct attack by the rich on the poor.
