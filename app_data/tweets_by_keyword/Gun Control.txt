@Guy4Progress @FaithTheFlame @gun_control_ca @saranimd If that’s the case then you’ve just made the argument to ban autos, medical procedures and any other thing that results in more deaths than firearms. The core problem is and always has been violence and its cause. Until that’s addressed you won’t solve the problem.
@RealDougBaker @davidhogg111 But still your argument is that Gun Control won't prevent all murders, so why bother preventing any. Gotcha. Done here.
@KamalaHarris Like armed security? Like at airports, stadiums, courtrooms &amp; government facilities ? Or aren’t the children worth protecting?

@trubl9 @dillzilla99 @RepSwalwell This is the script of every nonsensical gun control advocate.  You claim you don't want to ban guns, then you make a proposal that has the sole purpose of banning guns for the law abiding.  Should we throw car dealers and makers in jail when someone dies in a car accident?
@ABC So, if your throw is off, you might end up seriously hurting someone who is trying to get away, too! How about we just get some real gun control and actually act like we want to stop this mass shooting madness?!
@LittleBlueDotTx @NRA For the violence you seem to be complaining about, the vast majority of it is concentrated 5% of the country; all of which are locations with heavy handed gun control. The mass shootings happen almost exclusively in gun free zones, and the majority of the rest, in states with GC.
So still no gun control but THANK GOD they’ve regulated mango &amp; mint Juul pods due to their appeal to children
@Hassan_Oficiel @lilvvvvv Guns do not kill people. A gun sitting on a table by itself cannot kill anyone unless a person picks it up and uses it. Not trying to say we don’t need better gun control because we do, but the root of the problem is people.

@agarc69 @NRA That's a risk regardless of color dolt! But a very small one and any good self defense training tells you once the person is under control put the gun away so the cops that show up don't think your the bad guy &amp; shoot U (not to excuse an obvious lack of training on the cops part)

@NonWhiteHat The ironic thing though, guns are actually the one issue (aside from social progressivism) which I agree with the far left on the most. They perceive gun control as a "bourgeois liberal" position. Obviously I disagree with the why but horseshoe theory is true for gun rights.

@downunderguy2 @SauterRory @realDonaldTrump It's been 290 years, so far it works. You don't have gun control, you have gun owner control, ie controlled people. We The People are the government here. Guns are not dangerous when more sane people are armed than the insane or criminals. We have an open border=we must be armed.

@KyleKashuv You are missing the point, the first thing that Nazi Germany did is censorship &amp; a propaganda campaign. This led to many other things like gun control, marking of Jewish business, forced wearing of the star of David, &amp; then round ups of Jews to send to concentration camps.

@PeterPaynePPKS @hansalexrazo @UKIP @GerardBattenMEP However my country has very strict gun control laws, which are supported by the large majority of the voting public. You aren't allowed to own firearms for self defense here. https://t.co/kNPAszmkjc
@LibertarianCon8 @NRA Again the criminals are criminals so why try to stop them argument. Why have laws at all...  how can you ignore the facts of gun control working in other countries? Are Americans special? Laws don’t work for you?
If the parents of children killed at American schools by gun violence can’t agree on gun control what hope is there for the rest of us?
@andizeisler The language of 2A suffices as well. 2 years of new research. It was a literary sleight of hand by design. The right to bear Arms never existed. The 2A is  a gun control amendment and nothing more. A legacy aka "treasure". https://t.co/Ewt5eC40Om

For the first time in my decade teaching freshman composition in a South Carolina college, more students wrote their research essays arguing for gun control than wrote arguing against it. The battle is long and hard, but we are winning. #MarchForOurLives
@SouthernCha0s @douglasgorden @shannonrwatts You can not sit there and try to have a logica conversation when all you want to say is “gun control”. Until you actually look at both sides of the spectrum and have common sense conversations, no one will listen to the left about what they have to say.
Personally, I favour state regulation of gun ownership over involuntary sterilization to control guns but you do you https://t.co/OtTJPgb3SQ
@RepKifowit What you said is the equivalent of shooting everyone who opposes gun control.
(1/2) I can’t stop watching the new Mark Ronson and Miley collab. Chills. Such a powerful message about the gaze society often has on celebrity behavior vs facing the darkness that surrounds us now...inequality, religious hypocrisy, racism, lack of gun control...
@DLoesch "Stay mature Tom?"  Never was, never will be. Gun control?? Let's start with getting rid of all the armed guards around the Hollywood elites. Oh, I forgot...they are better than all of us pleebs. We don't deserve to defend ourselves.
@janesports Don't debate the language of this sentence with the history you currently know because that was hidden by design to promote it. A testimony to the genius of Benjamin Franklin. 2A a literary sleight of hand by design. A gun control Amendment. A four part equation. 2 yrs research https://t.co/ATtZNoN7yQ
You may be a hypocrite day 2. If you talk about gun control to save kids in a classroom but support killing them in the womb, you may be a hypocrite.
@DocWashburn @chemaxtry @LanchestersCube @KyleKashuv @RBMEllis I don't think gun control has been used "against" minorities, I think it's been to their "detriment".
I don't expect the gun control crowd has any particular levitation towards a particular race, they just want EVERYONE'S guns.

@Heminator @AnnCoulter Maybe everyone has enough guns since they rushed out and bought guns when they thought gun control was coming under the Obama Administration. But as we know nothing has changed after all those school deaths and destroyed lives. Politicians have failed us all!
I mean I’d want to carry to protect myself from others who carry for evil purposes of murdering and/or inciting violence... BUT why can’t we just go straight to the root of the problem and be realistic about it? We need gun control.

@ChaosRiot1999 @R6Rider This is why Dems must go right. When Democrats can get people an AK and cargo short bundle on Amazon for less than the GOP, we'll be unstoppable. Only then can we pass reasonable gun control.
@KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 A tax on guns that the poor couldn't afford was a common gun control scheme in the 1800's and early 1900's. It's easier for the elitists to control the serfs if they can't afford the means to fight back.

@kristysf @stclair_sam @SethMacFarlane Not all opinions are equally valid. Would gun control reduce shootings, probably. Would it reduce killings? Somewhat. As a Jewish man said, "If my great grandparents had of believed in the right to bare arms in Europe, they wouldn't be ashes in Europe."

https://t.co/fPywih0cl1
I've never understood the argument against stronger gun control of "well people can still kill people with knives!"
Knives are not automatic, you don't just pull a trigger and kill several people within a few moments.

The logic is truly astounding.

She's came up with the idea to start naming mass shooting incidences after the Representative or Senator in the area who refuses to bring sensible gun control legislation.
The term "Gun Safety" which refers to the safe handing, operation, and storage of firearms has be co-opted and turned into a dog whistle for "Gun Control".

You can see it in the names of various anti-gun activist groups. I don't know why they try to deceive people.

@TomiLahren So what is that, 1 in several thousand? Great job, not a waste of resources at all; meanwhile, how many ALLEGEDLY mentally ill white men have gone on shooting sprees with no change in gun control, but the one "bad hombre" caught, you celebrate? Yeah, no racist agenda at all. NOT!
@CGCguncontrol Guns are available to everyone. Legally with lots of paperwork, illegally with cash. Crooks ignore gun control legislation
You might as well ban dashboard flower vases and call it a victory for gun rights, or gun control, or whatever.
⚡️While my heart aches for them, the gun control agenda I'm sure they advocate for in the article doesn't.  Even if my daughter were killed in a mass shooting, I still would NEVER advocate for gun control. My hurt shouldn't outweigh the constitution.

There is a story out of Memphis where a dad goes to HS and hits his son’s bully twice in the head. Most of the parents are praising him. I’m bothered by this. We talk a lot about gun control, but we also need to talk about school system failures esp. how they handle bullies.

Also, when I say I support gun control, I’m not saying that there shouldn’t be any guns at all. That’s unrealistic... all I’m saying is... there should be... more.. control... of WHO gets them.
That reminds me of Bola Simple, anyone that is familiar with PolyIbadan and UI in early 2000s will know this said person. There was this story about him and how he normally ‘control’ gun from nowhere during cultist clashes then. This was more than a rumour cus everyone believed.

I think I figured out how to have gun control. Just wrap the guns in romaine lettuce
i know it feels good to lobby for gun control but you have to understand that the large majority of gun violence is either carried out by illegally owned firearms or suicide (the latter accounts for 80% of gun related deaths) 

how much will stricter laws actually help?

@LNJStokes @stephenkb Thanks for responding, Gun controls such a marginal debate in the UK that our main experience is viewing the NRA in the US lobbying for machine guns to hunt deer. So any attempts to shut down gun control is treated negatively, which I read as Stephen's point around bad optics.

One of the simplest ways to prevent people, especially men, from dying of suicide would be stringent gun control. But given a choice between clinging to the symbols of toxic masculinity that are guns or actually saving men’s lives, Republicans choose the former.

Hey @HamillHimself, can we get a like (or RT) for our gun control campaign? https://t.co/eaanIOexHK

@RepeterGevar @TheAlchemist235 The only thing propelling this rat ship now is economic prosperity, technology, and gun control (in Europe anyway).
Dear all salad-loving vegan gun control activists,

Romaine lettuce has killed more people than the NRA.

@NateNeuwirth @hollowsfate @charliekirk11 Even if nothing changed (and there was  a noticeable difference after) that still goes to show that gun control doesn’t increase crime rate.

@DrSkipPhD @iamAtheistGirl Not today I don’t.. I just didn’t have anything else to come back with on that. Like I said elsewhere, I’m not against gun control, I think we need better gun control but banning guns completely is not the way.

@DineshDSouza @jack I wonder if the people who advocate for Trump's assasination also advocate for gun control.
And they call US snowflakes. This conservative woman is on the verge of tears as if she’s giving it her all at a matinee performance of Les Mis... I wonder if she has the same passion about protecting her children with gun control? https://t.co/KC03aqvjTB
#cularson2000 I thought that both articles portrayed great overviews of both gun violence and gun control. I liked how both articles talked about the social media aspects of gun violence and how it plays an integral part in violence.

These thugs are embolden by overwhelmed and weak justice system.
@Kimberly__747 Thank you for saying clearly what most gun control advocates think but lack the courage (or sense) to express in public.
Adam Ruins Everything is surprisingly competent politically. I always go in expecting some centrist rationalist fluff but his research always leads to the radical truth: Give the homeless homes. The war on drugs was a ploy to destroy black communities. Gun control hurts POC.

@FDinkelaker @fawfulfan I define progressive as supporting gun control.

Why did Tulsi refuse to co-sign the assault weapons ban of 2015 and only jump on 2018 bill after @ambertamblyn called her out?

Why would she vote to reduce gun restrictions for mentally ill veterans?

@BryceFleetwood By proper gun control, I refer to gun safety training. Having a handgun tucked in your pants is dangerous. If your in a Walmart, why have a round chambered?
@javierybarra21 You can remove lettuce from a store but it’s not gone completely.  I can get lettuce from almost any farmer.  Just a comedian trying to be witty and relevant.  I’m for gun control but what is the plan?  Stop making them or make them illegal to buy?

Good morning family! 

This is a great day to fight for social justice, equality, environmental protections, criminal justice reform, healthcare, education, and common sense gun control.

Who's joining me? 🇺🇸
