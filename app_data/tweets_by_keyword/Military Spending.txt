@Weneedlasers @Tidmarsh_in_ID @AngellRossi @Nyc1Simone @Ocasio2018 [5] We pay for Congress‚Äô healthcare including retirement. The argument has never been about spending $. It‚Äôs about who that $ is spent on. We spend on our military the same amount as the next 7 largest militaries in the world. It‚Äôs not a matter of $ it‚Äôs a matter of who benefits
@SenWarren We need security and the military strong. We need more now because last admin cut spending and stripped the military.  I wish your brain worked as fast as your mouth.
@WalshFreedom I think because given that we knew they were coming, instead of spending millions on a stunt to send the military to the border, we could have prepared other means to process people peacefully.  That was a show for the racist base
@Xiani_PCh not very fair to say. a lot of domestic programs initiated &amp; finished under KMT govt's rule. but politics definitely a factor. it's regrettable that Taiwan did not make best use of its limited military spending.
@realJeffreyLord So cut our bloated military spending. Don't ever fucking touch our SS and Medicare. We pay into that shit.

@cainns98 solution? Have a better functioning congress that can (1) raise revenue and (2) cut spending better (ie military funding). Also, half a billion isn't a lot.. that's the unit cost 5 F35 jets (if you don't count the $1.5 TRILLION R&amp;D cost).

@Jeggit Mm... the reason UK and US spending so much on military operations in Middle East is purely out of altruistic desire to promote democracy &amp; environmental issues.  Nothing to do with oil whatsoever. üò∂
@BrookingsInst There are profits for banks and the military industrial complexes in war. So that is why the US borrows trillions to fight wars. As opposed to spending it on improving the world.

@JackPosobiec $600 billion is our ENTIRE military spending and about 1/2 the cost we need to provide Universal Healthcare or SinglePayer
Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours!  I hope you enjoy your day spending time with those you love.  To those serving in the military- thank you and you are in our thoughts!
@DanCrenshawTX Honest question, do you think the military needs more money? Or just smarter spending? Because I know you've seen some absolutely ridiculous and significant financial boondoggles conducted by our armed forces
Maybe....just maybe...if we didn't have to spend 3x the military spending of the next closest country...$600B vs $200B China (a country with 8x our population) while we try to play savior and police to the entire world, we could afford it.

The things that make the US different than most other nations (that I can think of right now) are: higher military spending relative to GDP and absurd costs in areas such as healthcare and education. Thus, it's probably expensive higher education impeding social mobility.

A majority of all regulations are useless especially on business, medicine. Etc. people left to their own devices work best. Fiscally

@unclerocky53 @charliekirk11 Depleting our military? Really? If you overlay military spending and economic growth they are nearly parallel the last 30 years.

@todayng True, example: despite the US spending trillions of dollars in defence  in the past 10 years Trump is still complaining that the US military  is depleted and her assets outdated. Same goes for the UK and other top nato countries!
@CurtMills @davereaboi @TheNatlInterest Getting rid of the destabilizing terror tyranny in Iran must have been a foreign policy priority decades ago. US wouldn't have needed all the military bases in middle East, sectarian conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon &amp; Yemen that cost trillions in extra war spending...
@BBCJonSopel @LinesnCircles Russian military spending is 14% of what the USA spends - who is the enemy again?
@ToddHagopian His hand is forced in many ways. He doesn't hold the purse strings. The military was depleted so I agree with what he did. He should defund PP and cut welfare spending by half. He's not done anything more unconstitutional than your friend Obozo.

#Defense Spending:

America needs to remain strong, we are at the forefront of military innovation. We support increases in defense spending.
Issues r complex, &amp; a question whether Trump‚Äôs increased growth enough for a useful deficit reduction while still spending more on military, &amp; others ‚Äúhis pet projects‚Äù. Personally, even though I question some of Trump‚Äôs plans, we finally have pres calling spades right or wrong.
That's all he's ever about I don't think the military has to worry about seeing him anytime soon he hasn't visited yet because he spent too much time at Mar-A-Lago spending taxpayer money the military doesn't matter to him remind him of how he screwed over the military https://t.co/wYs33ClAIj

@nowthisnews @javid_mark Obama spending more on the military than Trump I'd not something to be proud of!
@scratchgolfer42 @ndrew_lawrence All of them. Cut military spending so it only totals that of the next nine nations below us instead of ten, stop giving tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy, and help the people who need it most regardless of where they were born.
@WhiteHouse And let's remember those in our military needlessly spending time away from home standing far from the border and missing the holiday with their families because of a political stunt by @realDonaldTrump

Also Repubs: "military wants more money?" https://t.co/7Iykcu6HCa
I'm not willing to give anything up when it comes to people's rights. But, would I approve of increased military spending in exchange for more spending on healthcare? Yes, probably. Not w/ any pleasure. But the costs vs. benefits are ones I would be willing to shoulder.

@TimForgot @realDonaldTrump Please, when was the last time we had a fiscal conservative in the WH? Reagan wanted smaller gov't so his plan was to expand military spending while cutting taxes, forcing every other area of Fed gov't to shrink. Bush I &amp; II, and Trump have followed in this mold.

@in4birdie Reallocate some military spending to infrastructure which would add more economic value over time.  Use tech to streamline government.
The military budget from 2017 was $681B, which made up 54% of all the U.S spending, 3% was used for Social Security and unemployment, 6% of the U.S spending was used for education. Why are we spending more defending our country than teaching the people who live inside?

@SenWarren US military spending in excess of what the nation needs for defense (which wasted spending is clearly at least half of the budget) is a crime against humanity for the lost opportunity cost the wasted spending represents in terms of what it would buy in helping people worldwide.

@Heritage Exactly. Sequestration under the Obama admin. did more damage than any foreign power could have. The 2 military spending budgets $733B and $700B is like a monkey wrench thrown in the works.

@realDonaldTrump It won't cost nearly as much as your golf trips and spending 1/4 billion to have our military put up razor wire that a contractor could have done for a few million.  Our crops rot in the field and food prices rising. Winning!

Trillion $ military budget &amp; tax cuts for the rich though oddly left out.

Why are you so afraid of people having enough? people will work, you don't need to hang starvation over their heads to motivate.
@SoCal4Trump @TulsiGabbard @realDonaldTrump It would be much cheaper in the long run to cut military spending and nationalize the oil industry rather than loosing billions of dollars each year on useless wars, lobbying, off shore tax evasion, and Corperate welfare and dig it up here in America not abroad.
@realDonaldTrump We get about $15B in military spending by Saudi this year.  It takes 7-8 years to accrue 110B in sales. $15B is very close to the 2% of GDP that you have asked NATO members to spend on defense
@BillAnwar2 @BernieSanders He literally just told you he would raise taxes on the 1% and cut military spending.

In addition the tax revenue actually caused the public debt to rise while Reagan cut tax for the rich and increased spending on military then decreased when the military budget decreased.
