Social Security
Medicare
Medicaid
Private health insurance
Disability benefits
Unemployment benefits
Food stamps
Housing benefits

BILLIONS in admin costs would be saved.

Taxes are what the government gets to spend on running the country.

@SenatorLankford First, it is excessive, especially with Trump’s gross overspending, to spend $1 on the border wall. Second leave social security alone! If y’all want that wall start a GoFundMe. The majority of Americans aren’t interested in wasting their hard earned tax dollar on it.
@wvjoe911 @SenatorLankford The Mexicans can pay for your stupid wall.  Even $1.00 is too much to pay for a needless, ineffective wall. Hands off our Social Security!  It is not yours to take.  I have paid into that system and it is part of my fed retirement!

@nikkiwentling @DrPhilRoe Desert Storm and Panama vet.
Didn't file claim until 2010, when I couldn't do it anymore on my own.

Appeal 2010-Present. Service connected, 0%, yet Social Security says 100% disabled. They then awarded a Pension, but won't pay it.

And where are the Forever GI Bill benefits/ us?
My grocery shopping print out showing $$prices is quite alarming when we look at the GOV COLA they “might” give to Social Security recipients yearly, which at times is 0%.
A few years ago a nice beef roast may run $12-&amp;15...now upwards of $25+. Everything has increased but COLA.

@JoePerticone He's just sad he didn't find away to drastically cut medicare, medicaid, and social security. He couldn't find a way to pay for tax cuts for the rich on the backs of those less fortunate.
@kathleenromig @CenterOnBudget Agreed. Raising the social security age without considering the disparity in life expectancy based on socioeconomic status is wrong.
@JBKolat @ArashParsi12 @Ocasio2018 @cindyhydesmith would be a fascist way of practicing socialism. Non-fascist ways of practicing socialism include things like social security and universal health care. Those don't involve killing dissidents; ideologies can overlap, it's not a sports game where one ideology wins and one loses.
@SenWarren @DeptVetAffairs How about you fix Social Security as well because that is something we pay into and we earned and deserved it. You and all of your cronies have robbed the Social Security fund for your own special private projects.

@VoteOjeda2020 Thanks RNO! Politicians disgracefully call VA an ENTITLEMENT - same as Social Security, Medicare. “E word” is a profanity. People who paid dearly upfront are being scammed. Mitch McConnell: “entitlements are the main cause of US debt, not tax cuts, and we must revisit them next”.

@GreenspanArnold @SenWarren @iamforeverblue2 @DeptVetAffairs Agreed We also need to take away the Voting Systems from the States.

Then we’ll have a True Democratic process.

@wvjoe911 Republicans want to cut social security money to pay for a useless wall so Trump can keep his less than 40% of the electorate happy. Maybe Trump believes folks won’t notice when their grandparents are eating out of dumpsters because the Republicans took all their money they paid.

@cs00582scs Damn sick here entitlements called Social Security they paid their money entitlements are those handouts you keep giving 46 million illegals. You keep letting in  our country we're coming for you
So. Social security is going to build the wall. OK that is it. I work 4-8-10 hours a day. Corporate America gets rich. They want to build a wall. I want to see trumps kids go pick fruit, clean there own house or cook there own food. Then talk about the wall. Idiotos.

@Walleye_17 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So what are you scared of? You can’t tell me where the *you’re goes. Why won’t you tell me your name and address, social security number? All tRumpanzees are chicken shit. But I don’t need my degrees in physiology and chemistry to know that. It’s obvious to everyone. #youraloser
@AP_Politics @CalWd Fake news! The average social security payment is $1300 per month. It cost upwards of $6,000 per month to house illegal immigrants.  This really didn’t take a lot of time to research. Why does the media insist on lying or attacking Trump for telling the facts.  Sad
@MarkJKremer @KuroKitteh I don't believe this happened, I'm going to need your name and social security number to confirm
RT @denvernight: @RhinoluvsUSA Yes, from Germany. Also weird calls from a FAKE social security number.
Given today's standards of #datasecurity and #privacy, it may come as a surprise that some Americans once tattooed their Social Security Numbers on their bodies. Like this unemployed lumberjack in Dorothea Lange's classic photo. #personaldata #SSN https://t.co/Nnke5ZPPEW
Amen! Our seniors &amp; vets are suffering! The money in Social Security BELONGS to the seniors! Quit "borrowing" &amp; stealing it! Give seniors enough to live on! Vets deserve our help! They gave for us! We owe them! https://t.co/Ij2eesa2kP
Lmaooo y’all!! I’m in the elevator at the social security card office standing next to this old Hispanic lady and she goes “can you believe they have me down as I’m dead!! My insurance and everything is cut off” 

Y’all what 😂😂😂
@wvjoe911 Social Security is NOT your money.  It belongs to the American people and the GOP needs to stop robbing us blind.
@NPR Well yeah when my student loans are over $500 per month, and I have to save for 20 years to buy a home, and I have to save more because I can’t bank of getting the social security that I pay into.. yeah how can I spend money??

@Tracyjwp @Kansier21 @DavidHindberg @nkdpagan @jillsells @rweagley @NoelElMagnifico @ladybuttons1 @davidmweissman @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC Is there a source for that? Because that’s just not true. Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform Act in 1996. Undocumented immigrants can’t receive Medicaid, food stamps, CHIP, disability, social security, or welfare. The only things they can receive are emergency aid
@Lord_of_Crypto might as well give out my social security number
This is the GOP's gift to its voters. Where is the GOP Wisconsin Congressional Delegation? @SenRonJohnson @JimPressOffice  @Duffy4Wisconsin @GrothmanforWI @RepGallagher @SpeakerRyan They are in lockstep with this madness. Shame on the GOP.

Members of Congress Earnings: If you count the $110,000 in taxpayer-funded fringe benefits Members receive (including plush retirement plans, paid time off, and contributions to Social Security and Medicare taxes), they're earning close to $285,000 per year.

@LouDobbs @Jodyturcotte1 There have been a lot worse RINOS in the Republican Party. McCain, Flake and Corker to name a few. Rep. Ryan at least advocated for a balanced budget and saving social security and Medicare.
@Lrihendry Oh that’s special. Do you even know what “Socialism “ is? Do you drive our roads or ever plan to use Social Security or Disability? Educate yourself before you make bold statements. These are important times and require intelligent dialogue.
