@jones7955 I’m confused by this. First, who is out there seriously suggesting the death penalty for abortions? Second - if there was a punishment for having an abortion - you state the father should be held to the same penalty. But what if he didn’t know about the abortion? Or opposed it?

anti-abortions Advocates call themselves pro-life when they often aren't. They consider death penalty plus if a women aborts it is not for fun but bc she would not be able to take care of the child/own health/was raped whatever. Taking away a woman's choice ain't pro-life
