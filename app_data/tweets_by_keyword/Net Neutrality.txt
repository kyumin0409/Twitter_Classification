4. NGL. This is a long shot, but one I still think worth pursuing - if only, to get people to continue talking about the need for Net Neutrality protections. 

As I've said before: I think the best way to enshrine Net Neutrality protections, is for a telecoms bill in the future.

2. Threatened the safety of sex workers.
3. Caused a massive purge of Tumblr

Ok, all. Today's a #NetNeutrality day of action, so a quick recap: 

1. In May, the Senate voted to reinstate Net Neutrality w/ a narrow margin, using the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

@GriffinNicolas @GovInslee That’s not how it works, 5G provides access to the internet. But it is still access provided through an ISP. Doesn’t matter if it’s cable, fiber, ISDN, cellular. They all operate under the same rules. So Net Neutrality would effect you the exact same way.

Thursday is another worldwide Day of Action to support and save net neutrality. Be prepared! https://t.co/Ditz5m6drN
There’s still a chance to save #NetNeutrality! Call your rep today and tell them to pass the Congressional Review Act which would reverse the FCC’s repeal and preserve #NetNeutrality.  Vote must happen before December 10.

@arstechnica @jbrodkin What is net neutrality?
Net neutrality is heading to the courts (again): So will the current rules stand or be overturned (again)? https://t.co/qqkKejcS08 https://t.co/I51olPwnvT
Washington State already has it, because our state government made sure our net neutrality is guaranteed. I hope congress acts on behalf of the nation. https://t.co/vXW52VVohx
@KyleKashuv @benshapiro I’m just surprised there’s a single person outside corporations that supports repealing net neutrality. Suppose that’s par the course for Republicans being 100% loyal to Republicans, though.
Help save #NetNeutrality 
SIGN the Open Letter TODAY!
