The destruction of ISIL must be a top national security priority.
We must send a clear message to ISIL -- we will hunt you down and kill you no matter how long it takes. You are not safe anywhere.
My AUMF allows for the use of military force, including the use of US ground troops, wherever, whenever, and however needed to destroy ISIL.

Will be speaking with Fox News this morning at 9:30 about President Obama's address to the nation last night.
President Obama is also overselling the successes we are having on the battlefield.  His strategy will not destroy ISIL and he knows it.
President Obama is intentionally misleading the nation about the threat we face from ISIL.

We will destroy ISIL wherever they reside, fight them as long as they pose a threat, and we are ‘All-In’ when it comes to their destruction.

President Obama is downright hostile to the cause of protecting life. #prolife
Instead we should set our sights on winning the war &amp; that only comes about by electing a President &amp; Congress committed to protecting life.
We will fight to defund Planned Parenthood, but we do not have the votes to win the battle right now.
I wholly support Defunding of Planned Parenthood (PP). I would never send a budget to Capitol Hill that contains 1 penny of funding for PP.

President Obama’s deal with Iran is hemorrhaging support from the American people.
President Obama's speech today is just another example of his reliance on endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies.
Pres Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 the world’s most radical Islamist regime with the means to acquire a new military arsenal.
President Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists &amp; the world’s most radical Islamist regime with money to pay for the bomb.
Pres Obama’s deal Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists &amp; the world’s most radical Islamist regime with missiles to deliver a bomb.
Pres Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists and the world’s most radical Islamist regime with a pathway to the bomb.
Pres Obama is trying hard to sell a bad deal with Iran &amp; American people aren’t buying it. Straw man arguments are not going to help.

Approximately 8 out of every 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners that have been built in South Carolina are eligible for #ExIm financing.
1 of China’s #ExIm Banks authorized more financing in last 2 years ($670 billion) than our bank has since its founding 8 decades ago -$600b.
Would I like to live in a world where there were no #ExIm Banks? Sure. But I refuse to close our ExIm Bank and China keeps theirs open.
If our #ExIm Bank and its competitive financing go away permanently, the United States will lose market share and it will cost us jobs.
I refuse to live in a world where we close our #ExIm Bank and China keeps theirs open. I am not doing that. That is unilateral surrender.
The #EXIM Bank plays an instrumental role in helping American manufacturers sell American-made products overseas.

More money, weapons, and a locked in nuclear capability -- without any requirement to change behavior -- is the essence of the Iran deal.
This deal is far worse than I ever dreamed it could be... nightmare for our own national security, region, &amp; eventually the world at large.
The goal was to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program. Instead, we have ensured with the mere passage of time they become a nuclear nation.

In the War on Terror it is imperative we have interrogation techniques that are lawful, classified and beyond the Army Field Manual. #NDAA

I hope we slow down, take a close look at how to reform intelligence programs, and don’t make a mistake for the ages.
We have never seen more threats against our nation and its citizens than we do today.
I believe in those trying to defend our nation 24/7/365.  They need the best tools available to defend us against another 9/11.
Some who demagogue our intelligence gathering programs seem more afraid of those protecting our country than those seeking to attack it.
I have serious concerns about deficiencies in the Freedom Act. There are better ways to reform our intelligence gathering programs.

Read my 8 Principles on the Iran nuclear negotiations.  http://t.co/xG4EpfPoPw
#8. Certification by the president Iran changed its aggressive behavior &amp; no longer qualifies as a designated state sponsor of terrorism.
#7. Removal of all enriched uranium from Iran. No need for Iran to possess a large stockpile of low enriched or any highly enriched uranium.
#6. Iran must NOT be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges.
#5. There must be an explicit process for the 'snapback' re-imposition of sanctions if Iran violates the deal.
#4. Sanctions relief/access to funds be phased in &amp; fully conditioned on IAEA certification Iran in full &amp; sustained compliance.
#3.  Anytime, anywhere inspections of all Iranian military and nonmilitary facilities.
#2. Closure of all hardened and formerly secret sites. Iran must come clean on all outstanding issues raised by the IAEA.
#1. Iran must not be allowed an enrichment capability greater than the practical needs to supply one commercial reactor.
My 8 Principles to ensure we get the right answers and achieve a sound, enforceable deal regarding Iran's nuclear program.
.@WSJ Much More Is Needed to Stop #Iran From Getting the Bomb http://t.co/xG4EpfPoPw
Bottom line: Pres Obama is doing the least possible when it comes to destroying ISIL. Intends to pass this problem to next president.
Great job to our troops in raid that killed top ISIL leader.  Good call by President Obama, but this does not make-up for lack of strategy.

Now I hope the House of Reps will soon pass the Iran legislation and place it on the President's desk for his signature into law.
I want to thank @SenBobCorker @BenCardinforMD and @timkaine for their leadership in helping push this legislation through the Senate.
I believe any deal with Iran should be verifiable and include conditions to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.
As one of the primary authors of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, I'm incredibly pleased this day has finally arrived. 98-1.

Gadahn served as a chief spokesman for al-Qaeda while Farouq was a top-level operative in the organization.
Adam Gadahn and Ahmed Farouq, two American citizens who joined al-Qaeda, got what they deserved.

President Obama is the 'Equivocator in Chief' at a time when we need a Commander in Chief.
.@FoxNews interview at 2pm with @GretchenCarlson about Pres Obama's plan to confront ISIL and the Authorization to Use Force (AUMF).
ISIL is a threat to the American homeland yet President Obama acts like ISIL is somebody else’s problem.
President Obama says he wants to destroy ISIL but I don’t think anyone believes him. His actions are not consistent with his statements.
.@CNN interview in just a few minutes to discuss the threat of ISIL and how to protect our  national security.
Yemen is but the latest, yet I fear probably not the last, example of President Obama’s failing foreign policy.
Our nation continues to be weakened by the Obama Admin's lack of an overall strategy to deal with the threat posed by radical Islam.
AQAP is a committed enemy of the United States and is believed to have been responsible for the recent terror attacks in Paris. #Yemen
I fear these latest developments will create a vacuum that will ultimately benefit al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). #Yemen

It is time for President Obama to quit equivocating and quickly provide #Ukraine the defensive weapons it needs.
The Ukrainian people do not have time for President Obama’s “strategic patience.”
President Obama’s continual weakness in the face of aggression is making the world a more dangerous place.
The Obama Doctrine of leading from behind and showing weakness in face of aggression seems to be spreading throughout the world.
There was no mention of defensive weapons, but I hope that will be the Obama Administration's next step. #Ukraine #MSC2015
.@VP Biden's challenge to all nations to stand up to Russia and stand behind #Ukraine will matter -- if heeded. #MSC2015
@VP Biden gave an excellent and compelling speech exposing Russia for the bad actors they have become. #MSC2015
The Obama Doctrine, or “Strategic Patience,” has led to a world in chaos.
The consequences of Obama’s “Strategic Patience” are an America that is less secure and at greater risk.
I doubt ISIL, the Iranian mullahs, or Vladmir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama’s strategy of ‘Strategic Patience.’

Commander-in-Chief should immediately put our enemies on notice they conduct these attacks against our nation &amp; interests at their own peril

The Surgeon General nominee - previously blocked - will be confirmed due to missteps. He was far to radical to serve.
Some of the tactics employed today will result in numerous Obama nominees - previously blocked - to end up being confirmed.
We need to learn to not repeat the mistakes of the past. The American people expect, if not outright demand, better from us.

Tonight, the majority of House Democrats showed they were not serious about governing the country.

A nuclear-capable Iran is a threat to our own national security given Irans record of sharing military technology w terrorist organizations.
A nuclear-capable Iran represents an existential threat to our strongest ally in the region, Israel.

Mr. President, if you can’t come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is regarding ISIL.
Whenever American air power has been employed, in coordination with reliable partners on the ground, ISIL has been devastated.
However, condemnation is not enough to deal with this scourge.  It is time we act decisively against ISIL wherever it resides.
Our hearts and prayers go out to the family of Mr. Sotloff and all those who have suffered under ISIL’s barbaric behavior.

It really in many ways started with Benghazi when our consulate was overrun and our first Ambassador was killed...  http://t.co/a19g5OxmS1
I think Putin believes Obama is really all talk and no action. And unless we push back soon, the worse is yet to come.
Putin basically came to the conclusion after Benghazi, Syria, Egypt - everything Obama has been engaged in - he's a weak indecisive leader.
It started with Benghazi. When you kill Americans and nobody pays a price, you invite this type of aggression. #Ukraine
The world is NEVER in a better place when you have a weak, indecisive American president. And Russia is a symptom of that weakness.

A limited military strike -- which is not part of an overall strategy -- can do more harm than good.
Limited military action can be effective.  Boots on the ground and an open-ended engagement are not required.
I want to ensure it has intended effect of degrading Assads’ capabilities. A military strike cannot be ‘check-the-box’ action.
I hope we can find some accommodation to ensure military action is effective, limited, and contains a ‘follow-on’ strategy.

Graham urges US strike on American al Qaeda leader Adam Gadahn http://t.co/yaGFFZWzat  @thehill
Finally, it’s been almost a year since the attack on our consulate in #Benghazi and no one has been brought to justice. Simply unacceptable.
If captured, Gadahn should NOT be read his Miranda rights but held as an enemy combatant under the Law of War for intelligence gathering.
The use of lethal force against American-citizen Al-Qaeda leader Adam Gadahn is appropriate and should be utilized without hesitation.
Even though Adam Gadahn is an American citizen, he should BE subject to being killed or captured by our military and intelligence forces.
Adam Gadahn is an American citizen who has aligned himself with Al-Qaeda. He should be considered an enemy combatant, not a common criminal.

On issue after issue the #NLRB is destroying jobs and making the United States uncompetitive in the international marketplace.
The #NLRB seems hell-bent on interjecting themselves into private sector business decisions for purely political reasons.
The #NLRB has been the Grim Reaper of job creation. In South Carolina we have seen 1st hand just how destructive their actions can be.
Offering 3 amendments today in Senate Approps Committee to protect American businesses from the #NLRB's job-killing tactics.
Americans deserve permanent relief from #Obamacare.
#Obamacare is unworkable and harmful to the economy. Pres Obama delaying the employer mandate is an acknowledgement of this fact.

For GOP to adopt a practical solution to illegal immigration is a step in the right direction and will help us grow our numbers.
The days of the Republican Party being the party of self-deportation are over. #immigration
GOP Sens in 2013, almost to a person, rejected idea 11 million people are going to self-deport or we are going to put them all in jail.

Rather buy oil from Canadian allies &amp; friends than rely on oil imports from Russia, Venezuela, or Middle Eastern regimes who hate our guts.
We need oil, Canada has means to deliver. Nothing more common-sense than expanding long-standing, mutually beneficial relationship w Canada.
I know from my own experience, and in spite of all the heated rhetoric, issues like Keystone XL really don’t get much simpler to resolve.
I was one of the first members of the US Senate to visit Canadian oil sands to see 1st-hand how this resource could benefit our country.
The choice is simple – build Keystone XL pipeline, create jobs in the United States, and lessen our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
If the Obama Administration rejects Keystone XL it will be one of the most short-sighted decisions in memory.
Some of the highest greenhouse gas emitting countries in the world, like China, are already lining up to purchase Keystone oil if we don’t.
Mr. President, what are you thinking? Even if we don’t build Keystone the Canadians have made it clear they will sell oil from the oil sands

If you believe in strong border security, the Corker-Hoeven amendment practically militarizes the border.
When people in South Carolina say 'Secure the Border' I get it. Corker-Hoeven is border surge &amp; designed to help us regain over sovereignty.
Corker-Hoeven puts another 20,000 Border Patrol agents on the border in addition to 20,000 we’ve already got … that’s 1 every 1,000 feet.

For over seven and a half hours during the Benghazi attack our Americans in the field were abandoned.
....numerous warnings from Ambassador Stevens about the growing threats from al Qaeda were ignored by Washington.
In Benghazi, multiple requests for increased security were denied and numerous warnings from Ambassador Stevens....
With all due respect Mr. President, #Benghazi and #Boston are compelling examples of how our national security systems have deteriorated.

Now speaking with Fox News about Boston suspect and enemy combatant status.
About to speak on-air with Fox News about Boston bombing.
A decision to NOT read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests.
Under the Law of War, suspect must be humanely treated, consistent w/ the Detainee Treatment Act, domestic law, and the Geneva Conventions.
As to any future trial, if this suspect is an American citizen, he is NOT subject to military commission trial. #Boston
An enemy combatant is entitled to a habeas hearing before a federal judge with appointment of a counsel. Usually, w/in 30 days of capture.
In a case like #Boston, it could take weeks to prepare the questions needed to be asked &amp; months before intelligence gathering is completed.
The questioning of an enemy combatant for national security purposes has no limit on time or scope.
American citizens who take up arms against our nation or collaborate with our enemies HAVE been held as enemy combatants.
Just released this statement with @KellyAyotte @SenJohnMcCain and @RepPeteKing about Boston / enemy combatant.. https://t.co/0i4Utv7EO9
Under the Law of War we can hold #Boston suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
...criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans.#Boston
The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise....
It is clear events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens &amp; terrorize a major American city
Just put out this statement with @SenJohnMcCain about #Boston suspect and #Miranda warning.  http://t.co/FZ4FKUb37w
I hope the Obama Administration will seriously consider this option. #Boston
The goal is to gather intelligence and protect our nation which is under threat from radical Islam. #Boston
The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
The least of my worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now. #Boston
We should be focused on preventing possible attacks over the coming hours and days.  #Boston
It is vital he be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes about possible future plots. #Boston
Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing I want is for him to remain silent. #Boston
I appreciate the hard work and bravery  of our law enforcement and intelligence communities. #Boston
@washpost Boston bombing is 'Exhibit 'A' of why the homeland is the battlefield http://t.co/ed7t0jjzOu
The Obama Administration needs to be contemplating these issues and should not rush into a bad decision.
The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to "remain silent."
If the #Boston suspect has ties to overseas terror organizations he could be treasure trove of  information.
If captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and first responders in Boston.
In 2010, over 13,000 fugitives failed a background check yet less than 15 people were successfully prosecuted.
We already have major holes in the current NICS system. Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let’s fix it.
I will oppose the Toomey-Manchin background check amendment. The proposal, while well-intentioned, is not a solution to illegal gun violence
I welcome a debate on gun control. The American people deserve to see where their elected representatives stand on the Second Amendment.
The gun control legislation can still be filibustered after today in the United States Senate.
My legislation, backed by the NRA, would make a real difference in keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
I have my own legislation, supported by the NRA, which I want to bring forward in the Senate.
Some politicians’ dream scenario is 1 where they don’t have to vote For / Against but can tell each side they were with them all along.

It was with great regret that I learned from General Allen that he will be retiring and not assuming NATO Command.

Mr. President, the last time we provided a pathway to citizenship and didn't secure our border was in 1986.

Gun control by Executive Order could be a power grab that won’t go down well with Congress or the American people.
The Obama Administration better tread lightly on the issue of using Executive Orders to implement gun control measures.
I have not forgotten about the Benghazi debacle and still have many questions about what transpired before, during and after the attack.
The stonewalling on Benghazi by the Obama Administration must come to an end.
Obama Administration leaked every detail about Bin Laden raid. But a major debacle like Benghazi, you can't get basic info 4 months later.
Who changed the talking points?  Who took the references to al Qaeda out?  These are all questions we need answered.
What did President Obama do during the 7+ hours our Benghazi consulate was under attack??

Will be speaking with @CNNsotu this morning in 10 minutes about upcoming debt limit debate, national defense, Afghanistan, and more.
@SenatorTimScott is well-prepared for the tasks that lie ahead and will hit the ground running in the U.S. Senate.
That means entitlement reform, adjusting the retirement age for Medicare, means testing Medicare and Social Security and CPI adjustments.
On raising the debt ceiling, we should not borrow any more money until we address why we're in debt.
If we do not change course in our spending habits, the United States will become Greece.
The time has come for the President to face up to the need to control federal spending and the growth of entitlements.
I have repeatedly made it clear I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless we address why we are going further in debt.
Debt limit debate will be our best opportunity to get a handle on the out of control spending, which will bankrupt us if left unaddressed.
Its unfortunate President refused to discuss spending cuts in this legislation. He will not have that luxury in upcoming debt limit debate.
Finally, this legislation reverses the President’s decision to give Congress a pay raise.
Additionally, without this legislation, draconian cuts to our national defense will take place.
Last night, the Senate passed legislation, which prevents the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts for 99 percent of Americans.
The debt ceiling fight is where we can make major spending changes and prevent the country from becoming Greece.
The upcoming debt ceiling fight is where the Republican Party has leverage to get spending under control and address why we are going broke.

Today I wrote to the Tunisian Charge d' Affaires to the US that providing our nation access to this suspect is of the highest importance.
These reports also indicate that the United States government has been denied access to question Ali Ani al Harzi.
Press reports indicate Tunisian authorities have in custody Ali Ani al Harzi who is suspected of involvement in the Benghazi attack.
The American people deserve to know ALL the facts surrounding the terrorist attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.
President Obama and the Administration are not answering my questions -- or anyone else's -- because they're trying to run out the clock.
I'm offended by the Obama Administration's lack of honesty with the American people &amp; refusal to share information with Congress over #Libya

My response to the @DCExaminer story by @ByronYork on President Obama twice dodging #Benghazi questions. http://t.co/5gPHrLEy
Mr. President, the American people deserve answers.
Mr. President, this is NOT good enough.You promised us transparency.You need to answer this and many other questions.

Now speaking with Mike Huckabee Radio about Benghazi Attack. LISTEN: http://t.co/1IArljQL
Now speaking with Fox News @HappeningNow about Libya attack and Fort Hood shooting.
Speaking with @FoxNews at 12 noon about Pentagon's decision to characterize the Fort Hood shooting as workplace violence, not terrorism.
Based upon what we already know, this episode fits squarely into the realm of an act of terrorism.
Difference in characterization b/w workplace violence &amp; act of terrorism is meaningful - in a variety of ways - to the victims and families.
I respectfully disagree with the Department of Defense decision to classify the Fort Hood shooting as workplace violence.
President Obama's "Leading from behind had been a failure."
Libya attack was 'failed Presidential leadership at its worst.'
Libya is 'Exhibit A' of a failed national security policy.
Libya was a national security breakdown 'before, during and after the attack' on the US Consulate.
We need 'red lines' when it comes to dealing with Iranian nuclear program.
As we talk, the Iranians continue to enrich uranium.
Finished with setup and ready for @FoxNewsSunday interview on Libya and latest on Iran. http://t.co/YEgGScX7

Mr. President, did you consider these serious events? If you were informed, what action was taken to protect the Consulate?
Mr. President, were you informed of these attacks on our Libyan consulate? If not, why not?
This attack was preceded by an earlier IED attack against the Consulate in April 2012.
The IED detonated &amp; ripped a hole in the security perimeter that was described by 1 individual as, “big enough for forty men to go through.”
On June 6, 2012, assailants placed an IED on the northern gate of the United States Consulate in Benghazi.

About to go on-air with Fox News to discuss the shifting explanations from the Obama Administration about the Benghazi attack.
South Carolina Voter ID law was modeled after the Indiana statute, which was previously upheld by the Supreme Court.
Appreciate hard work of the SC General Assembly and @NikkiHaley for passage of VOTER ID which protects the integrity of the ballot box.
Hat’s off to @AGAlanWilson for vigorously defending our states’ interests on VOTER ID.
Today's ruling on Voter ID is great news for the integrity of South Carolina’s voting system.
If you need an ID card to fly on a plane, enter a federal building, or buy Sudafed, you should also be required to show an ID when you vote.
The American people deserve answers about what actually happened in Benghazi. http://t.co/5zM56eln

Check out the photos from today's Savannah River Site Tank 18 &amp; 19 Closure Ceremony. http://t.co/PkaLBy3y
WARN Act 'guidance' is one of the worst cases of “ends justify the means” politics in memory.
Members of Congress should be outraged by suggestion Pres could set aside WARN Act and reimburse companies who fail to live up to the law.
With WARN Act ‘guidance’, we are marching down the road to an Imperial Presidency.
WARN Act is yet another example of the Obama Administration setting aside a law for political convenience and gain.
The Obama Administration’s statement on WARN Act is an outrageous bastardization of the law and clearly illegal.
Not one cent of taxpayer dollars should be used to reimburse companies failing to live up to their obligations under WARN Act.
Deeply disappointed in the defense contractor community. Companies that make the decision to ignore the WARN Act do so at their own peril.
Lockheed Martin won’t issue layoff notices on budget cuts. http://t.co/J4g9OUb9
Savannah River Site this morning for tank closure ceremony, lunch w/ Aiken Rotary, &amp; afternoon meeting w North Augusta Chamber of Commerce.

Any defense contractor who fails to send out WARN Act layoff notices as a result of Obama’s guidance does so at their own peril.
This is Chicago ward politics at its worst.
Today’s guidance from the Obama Admin on the WARN Act is the most outrageous political bastardization of the law I have seen in many years.

President Obama’s failed economic policies have led to the worst recovery since World War II.
It will take a change in leadership to put us back on the path to a growing, vibrant economy.
Failed stimulus plan, Obamacare’s government takeover of healthcare, and massive increase in national debt are taking a toll on our economy.
Under President Obama’s economic policies the American Dream is in jeopardy.
Thousands of Americans are so discouraged by Obama economy they have given up on their job searches and are no longer looking for work.
With 4 more years, the Obama unemployment rate will eventually go to ZERO -- everyone who is out of work will simply stop looking for a job.

During Obama’s 1st term he’s accumulated over $5 trillion in debt and will soon accumulate more debt than all previous presidents combined.

President Obama chose politics over leadership. 'Hope' and 'Change' have become bait-and-switch.
President Obama avoids the hard work of fixing an immigration system which is broken and fractured along numerous fronts.
This type of policy proposal, regardless of motivation, will entice people to break our laws.
President Obama’s attempt to go around Congress and the American people is at best unwise and possibly illegal.
This is a classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership.
This decision avoids dealing with Congress and the American people instead of fixing a broken immigration system once and for all.
Mr. President, I don’t think this is a wise way to fix a broken immigration system.

Iranian sanctions bill should make clear that while US strengthens sanctions on regime we always reserve the right to use military force.
I am very disappointed we were unable to get bipartisan agreement yesterday to move forward on the #Iran sanctions bill.

Providing KSM and the 9/11 co-conspirators the same rights as American citizens in civilian courts would have criminalized this war. #GTMO
The Military Commission system balances the interest of the accused with the safety of our nation as a whole in this time of war. #GTMO
Military Commissions have been used in wars throughout our history, and they should be used in this war. #KSM
I'm glad KSM and the other 9/11 co-conspirators will be held accountable within the Military Commission system I helped create.
KSM, the mastermind of 9/11, is the epitome of an enemy combatant. His crimes against th American people were a violation of the Law of War.
If Chen Guangcheng and his family seek political asylum in the United States, the Obama Administration should grant it immediately.
The case of Mr. #Chen is fast becoming a defining moment in US - #China relations.
Case of #Chen Guangcheng is Exhibit A in how Chinese communist dictatorship runs roughshod over those who dissent from government policy.
If America does not speak up for Chen Guangcheng who will?  If his cause is not just and worthy of support whose is?
I'm confident with proper implementation, this will help secure our nation &amp; allies from future attacks using Afghanistan as a staging area.
Under this agreement we put Afghans in the lead and withdraw the vast majority of our forces in 2014 with their honor and security intact.
With proper implementation, this agreement will be the end of the Taliban’s dream of retaking Afghanistan.
With the signing of the Strategic Partnership Agreement we have reached a turning point in the Afghan war.

The construction and operation of Keystone XL is an economic and energy must-do for the United States.

We need to make tough choices about future spending and Senate Dems are showing a lack courage by not producing a budget.

Sec. Panetta has warned an addtl $600 billion cut to defense, coming on top of the $400 billion discussed today, would destroy our defenses.
Then we must replace the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act which calls for an additional $600 billion in defense cuts.
We should place Defense Department spending under the microscope with a goal of achieving $400 billion plus in savings over next 10 years.
I realize our current budget situation demands that everything - including defense - be on the table for some level of spending reductions.
We have built the finest military in the history of the world, and a strong national defense is the #1 priority of the federal government.
A congressional investigation to answer questions about the NLRB’s role, attitude, and relationship with th parties is definitely warranted.
NLRB communications show the agency had a callous and negative attitude against Boeing’s decision to open a South Carolina facility.
House/Senate still need to investigate the contacts between the NLRB and Machinists Union in their complaint against The Boeing Company.
I will continue to do everything in my power to put the brakes on the NLRB as currently constructed.
President Obama, by empowering the NLRB rather than reforming it, is making job creation even more difficult.
The NLRB has become an out-of-control rogue bureaucracy.

Withdrawing Mr. Solomon’s nomination to the NLRB would be an important first step.
It is critically important that we keep American businesses from moving abroad by fostering a winning economic atmosphere in the U.S.
Fear among American businesses to relocate and expand in the U.S. originated from Mr. Solomon’s NLRB complaint against Boeing.
President Obama should withdraw the nomination of NLRB Acting General Counsel Lafe Solomon.
Following #NLRB’s dismissal of its unfounded complaint against Boeing, Solomon threatened to take the same misguided action in the future.
President Obama should withdraw the nomination of NLRB Acting General Counsel Lafe Solomon.

We are moving to a more merit-based approach to port deepening and I’m confident Charleston will fare well under that new standard.
Today, about one out of every five jobs in South Carolina is tied – directly and indirectly – to the operation of the Port.
The Port of Charleston is our economic gateway to the world. #sctweets #chs
Deepening Charleston Harbor is the number-one issue for South Carolina’s economy. #sctweets #chs
Under the old system, South Carolina was shut out because we were not included in the President’s 2012 budget.

National Guard on Joint Chiefs of Staff is a fitting tribute to citizen-soldiers and the sacrifices they have made on our nation’s behalf.
Our National Guard voices need to be heard and they have earned a seat at the table where our most important military decisions are made.

Will be on @MeetthePress this morning to discuss payroll tax extension and Obama's failed economic policies.
Given its recent actions, the NLRB as inoperable could be considered progress.
I will continue to block all nominations to the NLRB until we get satisfactory answers regarding their role in this entire saga.
There are disturbing questions about possible collaboration between the Machinists union and the NLRB against Boeing.
I’m glad the ridiculous complaint against Boeing has gone away, but........
A congressional investigation to answer questions about the NLRBs role, attitude, and relationship with the parties is definitely warranted.
I find the whole episode between the Machinists union and the NLRB against Boeing highly suspicious.
It would be completely unacceptable for the NLRB, which is supposed to be an independent arbiter, to be used and help in a union’s bidding.
I have real concerns the NLRB complaint was used as a negotiating tool against Boeing.
However, it’s hard to celebrate an event (NLRB complaint against Boeing SC) which never should have happened.
4 the sake of the Boeing SC workers, I’m pleased to hear the frivolous complaint, that put a cloud over their operations, has been lifted.

President Obama has been a pathetic fiscal leader.  http://t.co/8sFzEmL2
I know it's difficult to deal w/ our mountains of debt, but America has always accomplished great things in the face of adversity.
The time has also come for President Obama to be involved, not as an observer, but as a leader.
On balance, Bowles-Simpson plan begins to make the necessary changes which will address the fiscal calamity we are facing.
And while the Bowles-Simpson framework may not be perfect, it is better than the status quo.
Like any serious plan to address our nation’s long-term fiscal health, the Bowles-Simpson plan has many provisions which give me heartburn.
Today I call on Pres Obama to embrace Bowles-Simpson. I also urge Senate Dem and  House GOP leadership to bring it up for a vote.
The Super Committee’s failure to address our growing debt problems only leads to future generations living in a poorer, weaker America.
Super Committee Failure: This is yet another reason for the American people to lose faith in Congress.

China is a bully and Chinese currency manipulation costs our state and nation jobs. They continue to under value their currency by 15-40%.
The Super Committee should "Go Big" on entitlement reform and future spending obligations before US becomes like Greece. #gvillechamber
America's tax code is antiquated and makes us uncompetitive in the international marketplace.
South Carolina won Boeing's 787 business. If The #NLRB makes #Boeing shut down, it will be the end of job growth in America.

I hope I am wrong and the President is right, but I fear this decision has set in motion events that will come back to haunt our country.

On Iraq, I respectfully disagree with President Obama.

Will be speaking with CNN's Wolf Blitzer at 5:10 pm about the future of US-Libya relations.
From my recent visit to Libya it was striking how much the Libyan people feared a Gaddafi return to power.
The decisions made in coming days about Libya will affect our own national security, and the security of the region, for decades to come.
Libya is trying to build a democracy out of the ashes of a dictatorship and the United States should be a helpful partner in that endeavor.
I hope Gaddafi’s death will be the end of the killing in Libya and the beginning of building a just and civil society.
The Mad Dog of the Middle East is dead and the Libyan people can breathe a sigh of relief.

@WSJ: Senate Republicans Urge House Leaders To Take Up China Currency Bill  http://t.co/c5caQxVU #scpol #sctweets #biz
Should it become law, Pres Obama’s jobs bill will prove to be as ineffective in creating jobs as Obama health care was in lowering premiums.
Rather than changing course when it is clear his policies are not working, President Obama seems to be doubling-down.
Pres. Obama’s Jobs Act is nothing more thn an expansion and continuation of policies which made our economy worse than when he took office.
I strongly encourage the House of Representatives to take up our China currency legislation at the soonest possible opportunity.
...But the current Chinese policy on currency is clearly unfair and designed to benefit them at our expense.
I want a good trading relationship with China and think we can have a relationship which is beneficial to both countries.  But....
I hope President Obama will be as hard on the Chinese, who are cheating Americans out of jobs, as he is on American business.
