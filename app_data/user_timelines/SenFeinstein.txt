Voting to remove U.S. forces from Yemen will send a clear message that we’ll no longer be complicit in this conflict. Without congressional authorization, all U.S. forces supporting the coalition’s war should be withdrawn. That’s why I support the Sanders-Lee resolution. https://t.co/CkZYPCqJeS
The president’s climate change denials ignore a mountain of evidence that shows we’re running out of time to slow the effects of global warming. We can’t afford to pretend the science is anything but conclusive. We must act now and do so decisively. https://t.co/ZtIYfWkduC
So there’s good reason the Congressional Black Caucus, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, dozens of other organizations and all 49 Democrats are opposed to Mr. Farr’s nomination. Tom Farr does not belong on a federal court.
In both cases the courts disagreed. In fact, in striking down the Voter ID law, the Fourth Circuit said that the law’s requirements “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.”
Mr. Farr has remained active in efforts to depress &amp; dilute African-American voting. In 2013 he defended North Carolina’s congressional &amp; legislative districts, which were redrawn to reduce the power of African-American voters. And in 2016 he defended a restrictive voter ID law.
Farr was a part of a campaign that mailed 120,000 postcards almost exclusively to African-American voters with false information designed to decrease turnout. When I asked if he was involved he denied any knowledge, but press reports &amp; a DOJ memo outline his efforts at that time.
Republicans used their blue slips to block these nominees and hold open the seat for over a decade. Now, President Trump has nominated Tom Farr, who has a long history of opposition to voting rights. He’s been a leader in suppression of African-American voters in North Carolina.
THREAD: Tom Farr is nominated to a district court seat that’s been vacant for 12 years because Republicans refused to confirm anyone for the entire Obama administration. Obama nominated two highly-qualified African-American women to this very seat.

Thomas Farr has built a career on the suppression of African-American voters and defended a discriminatory voter ID law that judges said “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” He does not belong on the federal court. https://t.co/zqNU2u98q1
In 1977, Harvey Milk’s election marked a moment of hope and progress not only for San Francisco, but the entire nation. It’s truly a testament to his legacy that he is so warmly remembered 40 years after his assassination. Today, we celebrate what Harvey stood for.
In 2016, Farr also defended North Carolina’s restrictive voter ID law in federal court. The court struck down the law and STRONGLY disagreed with Farr’s defense, noting that its requirements “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.”
In fact, two of three federal judges held that the state’s congressional redistricting plan violated the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.
Farr vigorously defended racial gerrymandering in a case where a three-judge panel in the Middle District of North Carolina found “that race was the predominant factor motivating the drawing of all challenged [state legislative] districts.”
The Congressional Black Caucus expressed its strong opposition to Farr’s nomination, writing that “Farr has amassed a record that puts him at the forefront of an extended fight to disenfranchise African-American voters.”
Important: The Senate this week is voting on the nomination of Tom Farr, who has a long record of supporting laws to restrict the voting rights and representation of African Americans. All @SenateDems oppose his nomination. We need just two Republicans to vote NO.
Happy Thanksgiving! Wishing everyone a restful holiday surrounded by family and friends.

Using our military men and women as political pawns to support an anti-immigrant agenda is a low point, even for this president.
These soldiers spent weeks away from home and the Pentagon wasted millions of taxpayer dollars so President Trump could stoke fears of asylum seekers and try to influence election results.
President Trump’s charade of deploying troops to the border based on security needs is over. Now that they’re coming home, the White House is all but admitting the president used our troops for political reasons. https://t.co/HvlTbkjgmx
Human rights is more than just a phrase, it has to mean something. And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government. Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable.
I plan to vote against any future arms sales and appropriation to Saudi Arabia. I also believe that the United States should consider sanctions against the crown prince and that the Saudi ambassador to the United States should not be allowed to continue in that role.
I’m shocked that President Trump said there will be no punishment for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. https://t.co/WTG14cKHGt
President Trump claimed the #GOPTaxCuts would lead to record job creation. Instead, the 1,000 largest public companies have collectively eliminated almost twice as many jobs as they created since the tax law was passed. We must do better!

Harmful actions like expanding narrow and limited health care plans, a lawsuit to end protections for preexisting conditions, higher premiums, multiple votes on the Senate floor and now promises to pursue repeal again, that’s the Republican record on health care. Period.

On average Latinas are paid 53 cents for every dollar earned by white men. And in California specifically, it drops to 43 cents. That’s appalling. We won’t settle for anything less than equal pay for equal work. #LatinaEqualPayDay
That’s also why we need the Homeless Children and Youth Act. It expands HUD’s definition of homelessness to better meet the needs of homeless children, youth and families. The bill would also let local communities decide how best to use federal funding to suit their needs.
We can’t help homeless children and youth without knowing how many are homeless and why they are homeless. Reports like this one lead to a more accurate count of America’s homeless youth, which is crucial to getting them housed. https://t.co/r1eDADMyj6

That’s why I support a public option based on Medicare and increased subsidies to achieve universal coverage. A public option would compete with private plans, offering lower rates, and providing real choices for consumers.
Still, there’s more to be done. We need to expand coverage to those who still lack quality, affordable insurance. And we need to work to bring prices down so that people aren’t forced to make tough decisions on paying the bills or paying for medical care or medicine.
Thanks to @CoveredCA, individuals now have a place to turn for quality coverage when they find themselves between jobs, self-employed, or without employer coverage. And many qualify for federal subsidies that help make coverage more affordable.
As open enrollment continues, it’s important to remember that California has seen great improvements in coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act.  We’ve gone from a state with 16% uninsured in 2013 to 7% today.
Strong fuel-emissions standards save consumers money on gas, grow jobs in auto manufacturing and fuel-efficient technologies, and help the American auto industry compete internationally. The Trump administration’s proposal to freeze them makes no sense. https://t.co/dDMSPIZC6X
We must also do more to enact commonsense policies that would prevent dangerous people from getting weapons of war.
We can’t ignore the recent spike in hate crimes and the pervasive effect of giving a wink and a nod to hate groups and those who would commit violence. It is incumbent upon all of us to condemn the anti-Semitic hatred that led to this atrocity.
I’m heartbroken by the tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. This is an act of hate, plain &amp; simple. Hatred &amp; easy access to assault weapons has left at least 11 dead &amp; four police officers wounded. Only we let civilians so easily access weapons of war.
Happy Navy Day to all who have served. What a great way to round out Fleet Week in San Diego this weekend. Be sure to thank the service members in your life for their sacrifice.
If it weren’t for President Trump and the GOP’s sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, premiums would be 16% lower than they are today. Reintroducing junk plans and gutting the individual mandate are only serving to make health care more expensive. https://t.co/FHCk7c0XK3

Republicans in Congress failed in the past to repeal protections for those with preexisting conditions, so now they’re pushing a lawsuit that would achieve the same goal. Their goal is NO GUARANTEE of affordable coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.

Republicans repealed the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which ensures young, healthy individuals are covered, in their tax cut bill. Repealing the mandate means 378,000 fewer Californians will have health care and is responsible for 40% of this year’s rate increase.
He also pledged to reduce the deficit created by their tax cut for the wealthy by cutting Medicare and Medicaid. Repealing the Affordable Care Act and slashing federal health care programs, which cover more than 20 million Californians, would devastate care throughout the state.
However, Leader Mitch McConnell this week made clear that Republicans will again try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, jeopardizing health care for millions of Americans.
The Affordable Care Act has been an undeniable success in California, lowering the rate of uninsured from 17 percent to 6.8 percent. We must protect the progress we’ve made and build on it.

The United States can no longer remain silent in the face of such brazen human rights violations. Saudi Arabia was once one of our closest allies in the Middle East. I’m no longer sure that should be the case.
If the White House continues to refuse to act, Congress must. The first step would be to reject a pending arms sale to the kingdom and suspend assistance to the Saudi-led war in Yemen. And we must seriously consider sanctions against anyone involved in Khashoggi’s disappearance.
Saudi Arabia, despite initially stating it was not involved, may now claim that Khashoggi’s death was the result of an interrogation gone wrong. That explanation is hardly believable. https://t.co/R2lhLdDVHU

If the government of Saudi Arabia is found to be complicit, the U.S. must halt all arms sales and end our support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Saudi Arabia was once one of our closest allies in the Middle East, but I think now is the time to reevaluate that relationship.
If he was murdered inside of Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic facility, not only would it be a clear violation of the Vienna Convention, it would also be a dramatic and unacceptable escalation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s war on dissidents.
I strongly support an investigation into the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, who hasn’t been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul more than a week ago.
Millions of books are published worldwide, but fewer than 10% are formatted for the blind &amp; visually impaired. Our newly passed bill will allow the sharing of specially-formatted books globally, vastly increasing their availability to nearly 300 million visually-impaired people.
The decision to move forward on 9th Circuit nominees without consultation or responding to my acceptance of the White House’s offer reflects President Trump’s desire to stack the court. I expect my blue slips to be honored as I was acting in good faith. https://t.co/7EYWmi7V0k

The Trump administration’s rollback of record keeping requirements for workplace accidents makes no sense. This rule encourages transparency and worker safety without imposing costs on employers. Revoking part of this rule will only worsen the under-reporting of accidents. https://t.co/AiqqLOtnDG

President Trump’s decision to allow junk health plans will take us back to the days of plans with no real coverage for essential services like maternity care. We’re forcing a vote today to reverse the president’s decision &amp; keep protections for people with preexisting conditions. https://t.co/f5RVw6jAGe
I joined my Senate colleagues in signing a discharge petition that will force a vote in the full Senate on President Trump’s decision to allow junk health care plans to return. This is a fight for affordable and essential coverage for Americans. https://t.co/YEaIYmylT9
Republicans keep trying to gut protections for people with preexisting conditions and allow junk plans that don’t provide real coverage. We can’t go back to the days of no coverage for maternity or mental health. That’s why we’re fighting to overturn President Trump’s regulation.
The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy, but barriers remain that prevent Native Americans from voting. We must provide more voter registration opportunities, increase polling places on tribal lands and expand voter protections. https://t.co/FDhryC0ugP

The confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh shifts the court far to the right, putting women’s reproductive rights, civil rights, environmental protections, worker’s rights, the ability to implement gun safety rules and the ability to hold presidents accountable at risk for a generation.
Confirming Brett Kavanaugh in the face of credible allegations of sexual assault that were not thoroughly investigated, and his belligerent, partisan performance in last Thursday’s hearing undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.
Dr. Ford came before the Senate and told 21 Senators she had never met, along with millions of Americans, about the most traumatic and difficult experience of her life. She did so with poise, grace and bravery. Unfortunately, she was met with partisanship and hostility.
Many U.S. manufacturers rely on imported components, and it’s exactly these kinds of companies that are being hurt by President Trump’s misguided trade war. Let’s use #NationalManufacturingDay as a chance to renew our call to support American manufacturing and end the trade war.
At the hearing last week, we saw a man filled with anger and aggression. Judge Kavanaugh’s behavior revealed a hostility and belligerence that was unbecoming of someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme Court.
Judge Kavanaugh has said that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, cannot be prosecuted, should not be investigated and should have the authority to fire a special counsel at will. That should concern us all.
Judge Kavanaugh’s views on guns are extreme. In a dissent he would have struck down D.C.’s assault weapons ban because they have not historically been banned. This logic means that as weapons become more advanced and more dangerous, they cannot be regulated at all.
When I asked Judge Kavanaugh about whether Roe and Casey were settled law and whether they were correctly decided, he refused to answer. He would only say these cases are “entitled to respect”.
President Trump promised to only nominate individuals to the Supreme Court who would be “pro-life” and “pro-gun”, nominees who would automatically overturn Roe v. Wade. In my judgement, Judge Kavanaugh clearly meets the test.
Never before have we had a Supreme Court nominee where over 90 % of his record is hidden from the public. Never before have we had a nominee display flagrant partisanship and open hostility at a hearing. And never before have we had a nominee facing allegations of sexual assault.
The rising cost of college textbooks is a big part of student debt. Today, UC Davis received a $4.9 million grant to develop free, open textbooks. It’s great to see UC Davis playing a key role in the effort to make higher education more affordable.
WATCH NOW: I'm speaking on the Senate floor about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. https://t.co/BZyMpaBwec
This investigation does a disservice to Dr. Ford, who gave such powerful and credible testimony, other sexual assault survivors including Deborah Ramirez, and the American public who expected the FBI would be permitted to conduct a genuine fact-finding investigation.
It is impossible to take this investigation seriously when so many key witnesses—including Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford—were not interviewed and constraints were imposed on what was asked and who was spoken to.
Republicans have declared there wasn’t a ‘hint’ of misconduct. Based on our briefing &amp; review of documents, despite a clearly restricted investigation, that IS NOT true. Our previous concerns about Judge Kavanaugh’s truthfulness have also not been assuaged by this investigation.
LIVE: Senate Democrats speak on Brett Kavanaugh’s FBI supplemental background check. https://t.co/LTLvKjxJvp
The terrible treatment of Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez by Senate Republicans tells every woman in this country to keep sexual assault to themselves. We must send a different message, a message of support.
President Trump isn’t alone in mocking Dr. Blasey Ford. Senate Republicans have called Dr. Ford ‘mixed up’ and said she has a ‘problem,’ tried to discredit her with mistaken identity theories, and Republican attorney Rachel Mitchell penned a flawed memo to discredit Dr. Ford.
The president’s attacks on Dr. Blasey Ford last night were appalling. He sent a clear message to victims of sexual assault that they won’t be believed. They’re even more cruel given that Dr. Ford specifically recalled the pain of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge laughing at her. https://t.co/QkEgzw0PcM
I’m so proud of all the brave women coming forward with stories of sexual assault, many sharing them for the first time. It’s important to remember how many women suffer in silence for years with the trauma of assault. Very powerful letter from Connie Chung. https://t.co/p6pUm3Xsw8

One year after the tragedy in Las Vegas, Republicans still oppose commonsense gun laws that will help keep us safer. The shooter used legally purchased assault weapons and bump stocks to take 58 lives. Today, someone could still stockpile the same arsenal. We have to stop this.
If the president were serious about banning bump stocks, he would support my bill. It’s the only way to get them off our streets for good. In 2017, the ATF said it couldn’t ban bump stocks. Now it says it can. The gun lobby will tie this regulation up in court. https://t.co/iqlxm99f2P
I’m proud to see California passed a law raising the age to purchase rifles and shotguns to 21. Senator @JeffFlake and I have a similar bill that would do this nationally. It’s a commonsense measure that will help keep us safe.
The Trump administration argues that since fuel economy standards can’t stop climate change on their own, they’re worthless. We need an all-of-the-above approach to solving climate change. Reducing harmful emissions must be a key component of that effort.

Judge Kavanaugh did not reflect an impartial temperament or the fairness and even-handedness one would see in a judge. He was aggressive and belligerent. He should not be rewarded with a lifetime Supreme Court seat.
The Republican strategy is no longer attack the victim, it is ignore the victim. The entire country is watching how we handle these serious allegations. The Senate has failed a test on how we treat women, especially for women who are survivors of sexual assault. https://t.co/aXBg2KrqWT
I’ve never seen someone who wants to be elevated to the highest court in our country behave in the manner that Judge Kavanaugh did yesterday. The person who testified yesterday and demonstrated a balanced temperament was Dr. Ford. https://t.co/GZid820OO5
Republicans have repeatedly asked Dr. Ford for a time and a place of the incident. It’s possible that Kavanaugh’s own calendar provides both. An FBI investigation would look into these kinds of details. https://t.co/iKHUh9GlEZ

Here’s the bottom line for Judge Kavanaugh: There was a third person in the room when the alleged sexual battery of Dr. Blasey Ford took place, yet Republicans refuse to talk to him. How Republicans can reject calls to subpoena him is bewildering.
.@SenatorDurbin 's question on Dr. Blasey Ford’s certainty that Brett Kavanaugh was her attacker could not be clearer, and her answer leaves no room for doubt. https://t.co/uQLDpyCUhi
@SenatorLeahy asked Dr. Blasey Ford what stood out the most from her memory of the incident involving Brett Kavanaugh. Her answer is one everyone should listen to. https://t.co/adlEl2riAB

What I find most inexcusable is this rush to judgment, the unwillingness to take these kinds of allegations at face value and look at them for what they are—a real question of character for someone who is asking for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/iAciVUGBh8
Millions of Americans are watching a victim of sexual assault be cross examined while Republicans have refused to call the individual she places in the room with Brett Kavanaugh. Dr. Blasey Ford's courage in the face of this treatment is remarkable.
The Judiciary Committee is not a court of law. Our job is not to put Dr. Blasey Ford on trial. Our job is to evaluate the credibility and character of Brett Kavanaugh and decide if he should be one of nine people to serve on the highest court in the land. https://t.co/PXGE9Q8mcx

We are here for one reason—to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh should be elevated to one of the most powerful positions in our country. This is NOT a trial of Dr. Ford. It’s a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh. Is he the best we can do?
No one is asking the FBI to reach conclusions regarding the Kavanaugh sexual battery allegations. What we ARE asking is for the facts, which the FBI is uniquely suited to collect. Republicans repeatedly refused to ask the FBI do its job.
Fact-check: The Judiciary Committee has never investigated allegations like Dr. Blasey Ford's on its own. That has ALWAYS been the FBI's job. Investigations should not be done by partisan Republican staff.

Republicans didn’t learn from the mistakes of the Anita Hill hearing and are making new ones. Blocking an FBI investigation, no outside witnesses, having a prosecutor cross examine Dr. Blasey Ford and scheduling a vote before her testimony are among their bad decisions.
Judge Kavanaugh is applying for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Today, @JudiciaryDems will question him about serious allegations of sexual battery against Dr. Blasey Ford.
The Senate is not a court of law. Our job is not to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh is guilty of a crime. Our job is to determine whether he has the character and qualifications to be promoted to the most prestigious and powerful court in the country.

Thursday's hearing should be canceled in light of a disturbing new allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh. The FBI must investigate ALL allegations.
Dr. Blasey Ford has accepted the invitation to testify next week despite being bullied and so far denied a nonpartisan FBI investigation that would ensure senators have the relevant facts they need. She has operated in good faith throughout this process. Let her testify.
Dr. Blasey Ford’s requests of Republicans have been modest in the face of death threats and harassment. Why won’t Republicans agree to hear from her?
Dr. Blasey Ford will testify next week. She has shown tremendous courage in the face of death threats and harassment and deserves respect as final details for the hearing are worked out.

These actions are irresponsible at best, a threat to democracy at worst. Rushing a nomination in order to hide facts is dangerous and disrespectful. Republicans have learned the wrong lessons. We must treat sexual assault survivors with respect, not bully or try to silence them.
I’m concerned that Brett Kavanaugh and his supporters have something to hide. Why not have the FBI investigate? Why not accommodate Dr. Ford as she spends her days with the FBI dealing with death threats and protecting her family? It’s one day. Why the rush? Why the bullying?
The recalcitrance, stubbornness and lack of cooperation we’ve seen from Republicans is unprecedented. And candidly, the dismissive treatment of Dr. Ford is insulting to all sexual assault survivors.
It’s clear that Republicans have learned nothing over the last 27 years. Bullying a survivor of attempted rape in order to confirm a nominee—particularly at a time when she’s receiving death threats—is an extreme abuse of power. https://t.co/XoAcqEQF1a

Dr. Blasey Ford has seen her worst fears come true.  She’s receiving death threats and has been forced to leave her home.  It’s time to stop blaming the victim and treat these allegations with the seriousness and respect they deserve.
The president’s instinct to attack women and victims of assault was on display again today. 70% of sexual assault victims do NOT report their attack to police for a range of reasons: fear of retaliation, shame and belief the police won’t take them seriously.
President Trump, I've said many, many times that my actions were motivated by Dr. Ford's request for confidentiality. Victims must be able to come forward only when they are ready.

President Trump’s tweets on the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria are deeply offensive. American citizens suffered tremendously due to the hurricane &amp; delayed federal response. Refusing to accurately acknowledge the death toll is beneath the dignity of a president.

The FBI routinely investigates allegations like Dr. Ford’s. They did it with Anita Hill’s allegations 27 years ago and they did it this year with allegations against Rob Porter. The FBI needs to investigate and the Senate needs to wait until that’s done. https://t.co/Eoi0i3uqFy
No FBI investigation, no outside witnesses, publicly stating Dr. Ford is “mixed up", &amp; demanding she come before the Senate while receiving death threats. Republicans don’t take these allegations seriously. Before voting on a lifetime appointment, there must be an investigation. https://t.co/ydw6doxLLz
President Trump, Dr. Blasey Ford did not want her story of sexual assault to be public. She requested confidentiality and I honored that. It wasn’t until the media outed her that she decided to come forward. You may not respect women and the wishes of victims, but I do.
I hope that each and every one of us will immediately denounce the horrific treatment of Dr. Blasey Ford. That this brave woman is receiving death threats and has been forced to flee with her family is appalling and heartbreaking. This abuse must stop. We’re better than this.
I agree with her 100 percent that the rushed process to hold a hearing on Monday has been unfair and is reminiscent of the treatment of Anita Hill. I also agree that we need the facts before senators—not staff or lawyers—speak to witnesses.
The decision to come forward or not come forward has always been Christine Blasey Ford’s, and that includes her participation in a hearing.
We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford’s wishes and delay this hearing. A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date.
Senate Republicans are still not taking these allegations seriously. They’re rushing into a hearing that is completely unfair. Anita Hill’s column today was absolutely correct: We have to do this right.
During every step of this process, I’ve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable. She knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.
Happy Birthday to the @USAirForce on their 71st anniversary and a warm thank you to all the men and woman that have served with distinction in its ranks.
Fact check: The FBI can investigate Dr. Blasey Ford’s allegations as part of its background investigation – that is their job. To say otherwise is FALSE.  It investigated Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas. It should investigate this too.
Wishing everyone a meaningful and prayerful #YomKippur across California and the country.  G'mar Chatima Tova.
The Senate Judiciary Committee should allow the FBI to conduct a full investigation before we hold any hearings on the allegations Dr. Ford has made against Brett Kavanaugh. Holding a hearing without any investigation signals no interest in getting to the bottom of this.
Republicans have learned nothing from Anita Hill. President Bush asked the FBI to do its job and investigate Hill’s allegations, which it did.  Now, under the Trump administration, Republicans want to do even less by blocking any investigation into Dr. Blasey Ford’s allegations.
According to the California Department of Public Health, there were 1,882 opioid overdose deaths in 2017, 373 fentanyl-related. The Opioid Crisis Response Act that the Senate will vote on tonight is a strong push to bring those numbers down.

I agree with Senator Flake that we should delay this week's vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. There's a lot of information we don't know and the FBI should have the time it needs to review this new material. Staff calls aren't the appropriate way to handle this.

All senators should want to know what kind of Justice Brett Kavanaugh would be. We should look at what he says are the “most instructive parts” of his record—his time in the White House—to make that judgment. #ReleaseTheRecords
Brett Kavanaugh himself said his "three years as Staff Secretary for President Bush were the most interesting and in many ways among the most instructive" for his work as a judge. The Republican claim that his White House records aren't needed to evaluate his nomination is WRONG.

President Trump still doesn’t get it on trade. California farmers export around $20 billion worth of agricultural goods every year, yet the president continues to attack our closest trade partners while failing to open new markets.

Impeaching Rod Rosenstein for doing his job is ridiculous. Last week, he announced 12 indictments of Russians for interfering with US elections. House Republicans are putting party over country. Russian meddling in our election needs to be investigated without interference.
House Republicans’ efforts to impeach Rosenstein are just the latest in a string of unprecedented attempts to disrupt an ongoing investigation. It's especially outrageous after the President's statements blaming the U.S. for Russian interference.
It’s shameful that House Republicans are trying to undermine the Mueller investigation by seeking to impeach Rod Rosenstein. Combined with the President's statements yesterday letting Putin off the hook, the Republicans' strategy to help our adversary Russia needs to stop now.
I requested documents and an interview with Maria Butina to determine if she used the NRA to establish communications or funnel Russian money to the Trump campaign. She refused to comply, citing the lack of Republican support. Today she was charged for acting as a Russian agent.

President Trump has to stop kowtowing to Vladimir Putin, and his Republican allies in Washington have to stand up and say enough is enough.
President Trump not only rejected the U.S. intelligence community’s unanimous public assessment that Russia interfered in our elections, he went so far as to say Russia’s attacks on us were our fault, that poor relations are due to U.S. ‘foolishness and stupidity.’
After doing his best to undermine NATO and insult our closest allies, today President Trump stood arm-in-arm with Vladimir Putin and did nothing to hold him accountable for his actions.
Key point in Special Counsel Mueller’s indictment: Russians hacked a state election board website and stole the information of 500,000 voters.
By not holding Vladimir Putin accountable for interfering in the 2016 election, President Trump is failing to protect our national security and the integrity of our democracy. Period.
Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation has yielded indictments of 32 individuals and three companies to date. He is following the facts and producing significant results.
Key point in Special Counsel Mueller’s indictment: Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian front that coordinated the release of Democrats stolen emails to influence the 2016 election.
Key point in Special Counsel Mueller’s indictment: After President Trump said “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails,” Russian intelligence officials attempted to spearfish Secretary Clinton’s server.
The intelligence community had already concluded that Russian intelligence, at the direction of Vladimir Putin, hacked Democrats during the 2016 campaign. Special Counsel Mueller’s indictment provides significant new detail as to what happened and the Russian agents responsible.
Key point in Special Counsel Mueller’s indictment: A dozen Russian military intelligence officials conducted the hacking of Democrats during the 2016 campaign.
Key point in Special Counsel Mueller’s indictment: Russians communicated with at least one American who ‘was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump’ about the release of stolen documents.
Earlier this year, we introduced a bipartisan bill to address hate crimes against religious institutions, after the concerning rise in bomb threats to Jewish community centers and threats against Islamic centers and mosques. We must get this bill passed.

The Trump administration has declined to defend the Affordable Care Act in court and the case will likely end up in the Supreme Court. Make no mistake, health care for millions of Americans could depend on who fills the current vacancy. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/N7tPysbuBo
Justice Kennedy was a swing vote on key issues. The next justice must not be a hard-right ideologue who would further roll back progress on voting rights, worker rights, women’s rights and other key issues. #WhatsAtStake
2.The Affordable Care Act guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. 52 million Americans could lose health care coverage if those protections are invalidated by a Supreme Court ruling. #WhatsAtStake
1.After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are now using courts to gut the law and strip health care from millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. #WhatsAtStake
A woman’s right to control her own body is at stake with the next Supreme Court nomination. Women nationwide have never been more galvanized and they deserve a say in who the next justice will be. #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/k2h0VdIlHK
Challenges to comprehensive health care coverage pending in lower courts and could end up in Supreme Court. Filling the vacancy with a hard-right justice could jeopardize quality care for nursing mothers, the transgender community and individuals with disabilities. #WhatsAtStake
Cases that may make it to the Supreme Court:

Comprehensive health care coverage for nursing mothers
False advertising by insurance companies about access to doctors
Requirements that wealthy corporations provide health care coverage to their workers 

#WhatsAtStake
A single justice made the difference between safe, legal access to abortions and dangerous, back-alley procedures. A new justice may unravel that. #WhatsAtStake is a woman’s right to make choices about her own body. Voters deserve a say in how the court evolves. #SaveSCOTUS
This is a fight for the soul of America. We must not be a country that tears children from their mothers. We must not be a country that traumatizes the most vulnerable. #FamiliesBelongTogther
Make no mistake, this Supreme Court vacancy is vital for the right of women to control their own health care. The president has a clear litmus test for his nominees, and that means the deciding vote against Roe v. Wade. #SaveSCOTUS #WhatsAtStake
Conditions in Gaza are appalling: contaminated water, a nonexistent economy, unemployment at 40 percent, and more than 1 million Palestinians dependent on U.N. food assistance. President Trump’s $305 million cut to humanitarian aid will only make it worse. https://t.co/LPge5CXBoZ
America’s role as an honest broker in this conflict requires us to be a voice for both Palestinians and Israelis. President Trump has embraced Israel’s hardline policies while ignoring the plight of Palestinians, helping fuel the violence we’re now seeing. https://t.co/LPge5CXBoZ
A Supreme Court ruling earlier this week dealt a crushing blow to the ability of workers to secure fair pay and good health care. This is a reminder of why #CourtsMatter. Our bill will guarantee a right to collective bargaining for public sector workers. https://t.co/21dK7AUwBw
If the Senate needed to wait nine months when Justice Scalia died, then it surely needs to wait four months now. If the American people deserved to have their voices heard then, they deserve to have their voices heard now. #FollowTheMcConnellStandard
The Senate shouldn’t conduct business cynically by bending to the majority’s will. Instead, it should follow Senate traditions and precedent. The #McConnellStandard was established with the last nominee and it should be observed today. Follow the McConnellStandard
As Republicans have stressed, the Constitution provides the Senate with a key role in the nominations process. They vigorously defended the Senate and the people’s roles when President Obama was in office, they should do likewise when President Trump is in office.
Some Republicans are suggesting the #McConnellStandard only applies to presidential elections. Respectfully, that’s ridiculous. Regardless of who is president, the Senate confirms a Supreme Court nominee. The people deserve a say on who controls the Senate.
The farm bill is a win for California. It invests in the crops we grow, promotes organics and helps feed families. We also rejected House proposals that would make it harder to qualify for food assistance. This bill will put more food on kitchen tables. https://t.co/3UzQhweZy8
My heart goes out to all those affected by the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Maryland, and my thanks to law enforcement for their response. We can’t continue allowing this to happen. Our communities deserve better.
Pres. Trump prides himself on deal-making, but he’s made a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians more difficult at every turn. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem, allowing settlement expansion and cutting aid to Gaza are not the path to peace. https://t.co/LPge5CXBoZ
Protecting a woman’s right to control her body has been one of my top priorities since I was first elected. The next Supreme Court Justice could roll back that right. Women deserve to have their voices heard, and following the #McConnellStandard would ensure that. #SaveSCOTUS
While I disagreed with my colleagues’ actions when they blocked Judge Garland from receiving a hearing or vote, the simple fact is that Republicans set a new standard. The #McConnellStandard shouldn’t be ignored just because a Republican is president. #SaveSCOTUS
When Justice Scalia died NINE months before an election, ALL Judiciary Committee Republicans agreed to take NO ACTION on ANY nominee. They said the American people deserve a voice in who will sit on the Supreme Court. If it was true then, it must be true now. #SaveSCOTUS
WATCH NOW: I’ll be speaking at the Senate Judiciary Committee on the importance of following the #McConnellStandard and waiting until after the elections to fill the newly-vacant Supreme Court seat. #SaveSCOTUS

Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in support of a woman’s right to choose. Today, we’re upholding that legacy by fighting for the Women's Health Protection Act that would preserve safe and legal access to abortion services for all women, regardless of location. #ActForWomen
Two years ago, the Supreme Court guaranteed a right for women to access abortion care without an undue burden. But since then, nearly 200 state-level restrictions on access to abortion care have been passed. We must #ActForWomen and preserve access to safe abortion services.
We #ActForWomen because safe and legal abortion access needs to be protected nationally. We can’t let the nearly 200 state-level restrictions that have been passed chip away at the fundamental right of a woman to make her own choices when it comes to health care.
4 months away from an election, there should be no consideration of a Supreme Court nominee until the American people have a say. Leader McConnell set that standard when he denied Judge Garland a hearing for nearly a year, and the Senate should follow the McConnell Standard now.
This is a manufactured crises, plain and simple. Previous presidents have found ways to enforce our immigration laws without separating children from their parents. If the president won’t protect children and keep families together then Congress must. #KeepFamiliesTogether
President Trump’s trade war is pushing companies like Harley-Davidson to move American jobs overseas. Now the president is threatening them with higher taxes for the fallout from his own trade policies. That’s not how we do business in the United States.

The bipartisan Equality Act would provide clear and consistent nondiscrimination protections for #LGBT people across all areas of life including employment, housing, federally-funded programs, public spaces and services, education, credit and jury service. #EqualityForward

Today, 30 states still allow employers &amp; landlords to openly discriminate against a person based on sexual orientation. It’s past time to move #EqualityForward &amp; continue the march toward full equality. https://t.co/gWZcbnn7Kb
Important: This morning the Health and Human Services Secretary stated that children would NOT be reunited with parents who are in detention. The administration is holding children hostage to push parents to drop their asylum claims.
UPDATE: Only around 500 children separated from their parents at the border have been reunited. Around 2,000 children are still separated. We must not allow attention to fade from this ongoing crisis.
Allowing unlicensed, anti-abortion clinics to give women misleading information about health care under the guise of the First Amendment is appalling. This further undermines the ability of women to control their own bodies and make informed decisions about their health care. https://t.co/v4irYkKtP2
The decision by the Supreme Court’s Republican majority to uphold Pres. Trump’s travel ban is deeply disturbing. He made clear during the campaign his bias and bigotry toward Muslims, yet the court gave his statements little weight. Let this decision remind us that #CourtsMatter

The Justice Department has limited resources and it makes NO sense to prosecute families instead of drug traffickers. If the Trump administration wanted to protect public safety it would prioritize serious criminals. https://t.co/k5XVnj762E
Women use an average of 12 personal care products with 168 different ingredients each &amp; every day. Congress has not updated the law that ensures these products are safe in 80 years. Our Personal Care Products Safety Act would ensure ingredients are safe to protect public health.
We shouldn’t be a country that rips nursing babies from their mothers. We shouldn’t be a country that puts dozens of children in cages with thin mats and aluminum blankets. And we shouldn’t be a country that detains immigrant families indefinitely. #KeepFamiliesTogether
The Senate just passed our Energy &amp; Water funding bill that provides $575 million for Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation for water infrastructure and drought resilience programs in Calif. As we continue to recover from this drought we must prepare for the next one.
No other type of product is so widely used with so few federal safeguards.  https://t.co/UVP5hPaoC0
Our skin is our largest organ, but there are few safety rules ensuring the ingredients in them are safe. It’s been 80 years since Congress passed a law regulating ingredients used in these products.
There’s absolutely no excuse for the administration’s failure to have a plan in place to reunite families as quickly as possible. I’m calling for an emergency oversight hearing in the Judiciary Committee so Congress can get some answers and hold this administration accountable.
Protections that limit how long children can be detained aren’t “loopholes.” They’re guarantees of basic decency. We have children coming to our border who are often fleeing horrific violence. We shouldn’t deny them basic due process or humane treatment. #KeepFamiliesTogether
President Trump has created total chaos with his executive order. Rather than reverse his so-called zero-tolerance policy, the president is going after protections for immigrant children that ensure they are provided with food and water. #KeepFamiliesTogether
President Trump’s executive order is a bait and switch. He will only end separation if he can detain families indefinitely and roll back protections for all immigrant children. He’s using a crisis he created to undermine immigrant rights. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Detaining families indefinitely is not only cruel, it's also unnecessary. ICE’s own statistics show that 99% of people enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention Program attend court hearings. The administration’s policies are driven by ideology, not facts. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Happy #Pride, San Francisco! Let’s celebrate the work of LGBT activists who have come before by continuing to fight toward full equality. Today’s celebrations are a testament to their hard-fought victories. #SFPride

President Trump has created total chaos. The administration has admitted it has no plans to reunite the more than 2,300 children taken from their parents. These families were torn apart without any idea how they would be put back together. #FamiliesBelongTogther
Enforcing our immigration laws does not mean enactment of policies that are inconsistent with the most basic of American values. The President has created a false choice.  His executive order is an inhumane solution to a problem created by a terrible policy. We can do better.
What is going on here is a bait and switch, and I for one don’t believe we should accept this false choice.  I will continue to work on passing legislation to protect children and keep families together. https://t.co/4OAxIhH7a8
The solution to the cruelty of putting children in cages isn’t to add their parents to those cages. Alternatives to detention work. We can enforce our immigration laws effectively with compassion – as was done under Presidents Bush and Obama. https://t.co/UBmKuQgAKm
ICE’s own statistics show that alternatives to detention work. The president has decided to enact a policy that ignores those statistics and is creating a humanitarian crisis on our border. Detaining families indefinitely isn’t a solution.
Withdrawing the U.S. from the UN Human Right Council will only embolden the worst abusers and further isolate our country. The Trump administration continues to cede American leadership in the world to any and all.
We’re a country founded by refugees and immigrants. From the beginning, America has been a refuge for all manner of people seeking a safe place for their families to build a life. #WorldRefugeeDay should remind us of the countless contributions refugees have made to the U.S.
It’s extremely troubling that the president’s executive order would require immigrant families with children to be detained indefinitely. The order appears to be the next step in the Trump administration’s larger agenda to eliminate basic protections for asylum seekers.
These families were separated due to a barbaric new Trump administration policy conceived in a cruel effort to deter those seeking asylum and better lives from coming to the United States. This policy isn’t compatible with American values. https://t.co/274VbxwCAb
Estas familias fueron separadas debido a una nueva política desastrosa del gobierno Trump, con el intento malicioso de disuadir a los inmigrantes en busca de asilo y en busca de una vida mejor en los Estados Unidos. No es una politca compatible con los valores de nuestro país.
The #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct does NOT allow sex traffickers to use children as pawns. To say otherwise is wrong It explicitly ensures protection if sex trafficking or abuse is suspected. Republicans are misrepresenting my bill to justify their inexcusable choice to not support it
Our bill puts the welfare of children first and foremost. It bars separation except in cases of abuse or trafficking. Any decision to separate a child from their parent would have to be made in consultation with a child welfare specialist. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Using basic protections for children as an excuse to separate families at the border is appalling. As is calling them loopholes. These protections passed the Senate with overwhelming support because they are commonsense measures to protect children.
Fact Check: Basic humanitarian protections for unaccompanied minors are NOT loopholes. My lead cosponsor on the bill to create these protections was Senator Sam Brownback, one of the Senate’s most conservative members.
Fact Check: Basic humanitarian protections for unaccompanied minors are NOT loopholes. They were approved by Congress with broad, bipartisan support. https://t.co/QGk6jJOn5N

President Trump and his administration are separating children from their parents to deter immigrants from seeking asylum and gain leverage to enact their anti-immigrant policies. They’ve said so plainly. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/Hrc9ucQqmr
Let’s set the record straight: There is no requirement to separate immigrant families. This policy is Donald Trump’s policy, period. Presidents Bush and Obama refused to implement such a terrible policy. #KeepFamiliesTogether
Donald Trump could end the separation of families today. If he won’t, our bill to #KeepFamiliesTogether has the support of ALL 49 Democrats. We need Republicans to step up to the plate and support our bill.
There's no law that requires a child be taken from a mother’s arms while nursing. This is the Trump administration’s policy. President Trump could put an end to this immoral policy right now. #KeepFamiliesTogether

The latest reports from the border indicate that large groups of children are being held in cages and some children are so traumatized they've attempted suicide. President Trump could end this horrific policy TODAY. If he won't, Congress must pass the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct

Kids are not pawns to be used as an immigration deterrent. Families belong together, it’s that simple. This is not about politics, it’s about who we are as a country. We must speak out when we see injustice. #FamiliesBelongTogether
President Trump has the power to stop the separation of families, but if he won’t take action then Congress must. S. 3036 deserves a vote before the whole Senate. #FamiliesBelongTogether

Congress has a moral obligation to take a stand and say that families should not be separated. Many of these families are fleeing terrible violence, traveling thousands of miles on foot to file an asylum claim and save their lives. To traumatize them further is unconscionable.

Immigrants and refugees have made important contributions to California and our country. This #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, let’s honor our history as a nation of immigrants.
Thomas Farr, one of President Trump’s judicial nominees, has a long record of opposing civil rights and supporting voter suppression. He’s not fit to be a federal judge. #CourtsMatter
President Trump’s judicial nominee, Thomas Farr, defended North Carolina's 2013 voter suppression law. When the Fourth Circuit struck down the law, the court described it as targeting African American voters with "almost surgical precision." #CourtsMatter
74 years later and we still owe a debt of gratitude to the brave soldiers who took part in #DDay. In a time of dire need, young men from across the country answered the call to serve their country. Their selfless sacrifice turned the tide of a war and safeguarded our freedom.
Thomas Farr, a President Trump judicial nominee, led the defense of North Carolina’s discriminatory voter suppression law. When struck down, the Fourth Circuit called the law “the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim Crow.” #CourtsMatter
Many immigrant stories from the past aren’t so different from those of families striving to make a better life in America today.  #FamiliesBelongTogether #ImmigrantHeritageMonth
#ImmigrantHeritageMonth is a great time to remember that America’s history celebrates the many immigrants who made the United States their home and helped shape our country. Immigrants and refugees make us stronger.
50 years ago we lost Robert F. Kennedy to a senseless act of violence. We would do well to remember his message of compassion and dogged determination to help the disadvantaged live with dignity in our country.

3/4 To keep children in huge buildings, behind fences, with no contact with their families, that’s not the way of the United States of America. Every one of us must stand up and say we’re not going to allow this to continue. It revolts me.
2/4 Consider this: A child wakes up, terrified, no familiar faces around. He cries out in terror, but mom and dad can’t comfort him, they’re detained elsewhere. This must be absolute hell on earth for these children, and it’s immoral.
1/4 One thing I never thought this country would do is separate young children from their families, but that’s what’s happening at the border. That’s why we’re introducing a bill this week to put an end to this.
We’re calling for more funding in the #FarmBill to help our growers meet today’s challenges. Research helps protect Calif. crops from diseases, pests &amp; other food production hurdles.

Two-thirds of @NatlParkService land overseen by the Pacific West Regional Office is located in Calif. Moving the office to a far corner of the region will make it harder to effectively administer the region’s parks, potentially offsetting any cost savings. https://t.co/Up2mvt7xc1

Retaliation by Canada, Mexico and the E.U. will hit our growers hard on top of the tariffs China has already put in place. This is quickly becoming a dangerous trade war with no plan in sight from our president.
The Trump administration still hasn’t developed a plan to help California farmers hurt by the trade war with China. Now the president is placing new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the E.U. Our growers shouldn’t pay the price for President Trump’s poorly thought out trade wars. https://t.co/DXBDJ1JeO9
Republicans often profess that every American should be able to see the doctor of their choice, but they have a different standard when it comes to women’s health care. Women who know and trust Planned Parenthood should be able to visit Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood provides basic health care like birth control and cancer screenings to more than 700k patients in CA under Title X. A new Trump admin. policy would bar these patients from going for these basic health care services. It’s political &amp; it’s disgusting. @PPActionCA
Last week’s resounding vote to legalize abortion in Ireland shows that access to health care for women is not a political issue. Men and women together voted to ensure women can make their own choices about their bodies and their health care.
Happy #Pride Month! Let’s recognize the diversity, dignity and strength of the LGBT community as we celebrate. We’ve made some real strides toward ending discrimination, but we have a lot more work to do before full equality is a reality for everyone.
Currently, @HUDgov policies bar Native American veterans from living in tribal housing. Tribes shouldn’t have to choose between building much-needed housing for their population or solely for vets.

I #WearOrange because we owe it to young people to make schools places of learning and not sites of tragic gun violence. We can do better. We can ban bump-stocks, expand background checks and ban assault weapons. Let’s get weapons of war off our streets &amp; make schools safe again.
The Trump administration’s latest effort to bar patients from Planned Parenthood is a new low in their efforts to roll back women’s reproductive rights. President Trump, Republicans in Congress and their political base want to take women back to the days before Roe v. Wade.
Because #FamiliesBelongTogether, I’m working on legislation that would bar the separation of immigrant children from their parents. America should not be a country that traumatizes young children.
Congress has steadfastly funded the modernization of our nuclear stockpile and its infrastructure over the last 8 years. The low-yield submarine-launched ballistic missile is an additional, unnecessary expense that our own military says it doesn’t need to deter Russia.
Gen. John Hyten, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, testified before Congress, “I have everything I need today to deter Russia from doing anything against the United States of America. We're fully ready against any threat that exists today, without a doubt.”
New nuclear weapons are unnecessary. We already possess enough to destroy the planet several times over and are undergoing a $1.7 trillion modernization of our existing arsenal. New nuclear weapons would be on top of that enormous expense.
Congress is about to give President Trump a dangerous new nuclear weapon, a low-yield submarine-launched ballistic missile that is small enough to be used on a battlefield. This is a mistake, and I strongly oppose it. There is no winning a nuclear war.
Separating young children from their parents could harm them for life. Many of these families are fleeing terrible violence at home and come to this country to file an asylum claim. To terrorize them further is unconscionable
Traumatizing young immigrant children and their parents is a new low. This is not who we are as a nation. History will not be kind to us if we don’t speak out and end this shameful policy.

President Trump thinks trade wars are easy to win, but unless he reverses course, it will be American consumers, workers and families who lose.
The president claims he’s acting to protect American jobs, but his misguided trade policies are instead endangering the jobs of thousands of Californians, from longshoremen and manufacturers to agriculture workers and construction workers.
The Trump administration is now announcing steel tariffs on our closest trade partners and allies. Almost 25 percent of the steel and aluminum imported in the United States comes through California’s ports, generating more than $4 billion in trade activity.
California has borne the brunt of President Trump’s global trade war as countries retaliate with tariffs on our products. California farmers are being hit particularly hard.
It’s hard to conceive of a policy more horrific than separating children from their parents. I’m working on legislation that would prevent the intentional separation of immigrant families. Congress has a moral obligation to take a stand here.
Our drug overdose and opioid epidemic requires a comprehensive approach. The Substance Abuse Prevention Act would ensure drug prevention and treatment programs continue. https://t.co/t8RQcC9FRN
Our bipartisan bill would give DEA the ability to factor in abuse and overdose data when deciding the quantity of drugs to allow onto the market. This policy would ensure legitimate access to pain meds while cracking down on abuse.
One driver of the opioid epidemic is the refusal of distributors and manufacturers to report suspicious orders by pharmacies. Our bill would provide the DEA with new tools to enforce reporting of suspicious opioid orders.
The drug overdose epidemic is a national crisis. 64,000 Americans were killed by drug overdoses in 2016—more than during the entire Vietnam War. The Judiciary Committee recently passed five bills to address this epidemic. Learn more: https://t.co/t8RQcC9FRN

Fuel economy standards are required to be as strong as the technology will allow. I helped write that law. That’s why new cars are on target to get more than 50 miles to the gallon in 2025. The American people deserve nothing less.
DOT and EPA owe it to the American people to work with California and save the fuel economy standards. I’ve told them that. The auto industry has told them that. The president has told them that. What are they waiting for?
President Trump and Vice President Pence last week launched one of their most extreme, and harmful attacks on women’s reproductive health. We won't stand for it. #NoGagRule #TitleX
Women in California and across the country rely on #TitleX for basic health care. Planned Parenthood alone represents 31% of Title X clinics in California and 69% of patients. President Trump’s need for a political win is jeopardizing women’s health.
When you’re filling up at the pump this weekend, remember that the fuel economy standards are important. New cars could get more than 50 mpg by 2025, but Pres. Trump is thinking about freezing average gas mileage in place instead. That’s not going to cut it for California.
My thoughts are with the students and families affected by the shooting at Noblesville West Middle School. It’s alarming our gun violence epidemic has spread to middle schools. We owe it to the young people of this country to put an end to gun violence and make them safe again.
In California in 2015, 353 family planning clinics received #TitleX funding. They provided care to more than 1 million women. President Trump's decision to block trusted clinics from the program is a blatant attack on women’s health and freedom.

Despite the spin efforts by @CadizWater, a recent peer-reviewed scientific study adds to the body of evidence that Bonanza Spring is fed by the very aquifer that Cadiz plans to pump from. Desert flowers, tortoises and Joshua trees are all dependent on that spring for life.
The Dept. of the Interior, USGS and now a former water district manager all agree: @CadizWater plans to pump an unsustainable amount of water from a vital Mojave Desert aquifer. This company’s unsurpassed greed threatens to destroy a delicate ecosystem.
True commitment to tortoise preservation would be abandoning efforts to drain an aquifer vital to desert tortoises living in the 1.6 million-acre Mojave National Preserve. https://t.co/3EpPpesuVp

It’s unconscionable that this administration would question the eligibility of LGBT persons to claim asylum. 72 countries effectively outlaw same-sex relations and many lack adequate protections against violence. These people should be offered protection, not more discrimination.
A decade ago, the U.S. economy was on the brink of collapse. Banks were teetering. Unemployment was skyrocketing. Millions of jobs were lost. Trillions of dollars in savings evaporated. That’s the context Dodd-Frank was passed in &amp; I find it unthinkable Congress has weakened it.
It’s extraordinary that Congress would roll back regulations passed under Dodd-Frank designed to prevent another financial crisis. 10 years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and we’ve already forgotten the lessons of 2008.

This administration’s lack of compassion could not be more clear: separating immigrant mothers from their children, detaining pregnant women and curbing the ability of women fleeing domestic violence to receive asylum. We should all be troubled by these actions.
I stand with the my colleagues in demanding Pres. Trump respect the rights of vulnerable immigrants making their way to the U.S. Stop separating families. Stop detaining pregnant women. Treat immigrants and asylum seekers with dignity and empathy. We must live up to our values.
It’s cruel and inhumane for President Trump’s administration to separate young children from their mothers. To separate families to deter immigrants, many of whom are fleeing terrible violence, flies in the face of everything America stands for.
Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead without interference or delay. Rod Rosenstein must protect the Special Counsel investigation as he promised Congress.
Independent investigations are essential to the proper functioning of a democracy. Fidelity to the rule of law is the bedrock of our democracy.
Republicans have shown a willingness to disclose sensitive information, distort facts and undermine Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. The independence of law enforcement shouldn’t be sacrificed for political gain.
Holding a partisan meeting on highly-classified information puts an active criminal investigation and national security sources at risk. The fact that this meeting would be done in a partisan fashion demonstrates that this is nothing but political calculations at their worst.
The White House demand that the Justice Department share highly-classified information for a partisan briefing of Republican Members of Congress is alarming. All Americans should be concerned.
The president’s contempt for the rule of law must be countered. No man is above the law – including the president. The independence of law enforcement investigations from political interference must not be up for negotiation.
The president is now demanding information about an open and ongoing criminal investigation. Neither the president nor his staff should be reviewing sensitive information about an open investigation, let alone one into his own campaign.
President Trump’s repeated attempts to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation are unprecedented.
There’s no greater injustice than a false conviction. Kevin Cooper has been on death row for 30 years. If DNA evidence could exonerate him by proving that he was not at the scene of the crime, more testing should be done now! https://t.co/aA0tMJUJiO

Strong, qualified leadership is absolutely vital to fulfilling the EPA’s mission. It’s troubling that the Trump administration chose a former oil industry spokesman who has defended oil spills and questioned climate change to lead the work here as the Region 9 administrator.

4% of the world’s population

42% of the world’s guns 

31% of mass shootings

216 school shootings since Columbine. 

These statistics should horrify every American.We have a gun violence epidemic in this country that can only be addressed with commonsense gun reform.
Our schools should be sanctuaries and places of learning. Santa Fe had an active-shooter plan and armed resource officers, but a shooter was still able to kill eight students and two teachers. The best way to make our schools safe is to strengthen our gun safety laws.
Gun violence is a uniquely American epidemic &amp; the number of students affected continues to grow. We can’t sit idly by as our children are being killed by gun violence. The time for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks,“red-flag” laws &amp; a ban on bump stocks is NOW!

The Justice Department is not an arm of the White House. The Justice Department is independent and serves the American people. Its job is to follow the facts and the law. Law enforcement investigations must be initiated and carried out free from political interference.
The president's statement indicating that he will order the Justice Department to investigate the FBI could not be more disturbing and reiterates his deep contempt for the rule of law.
Title X funded clinics like Planned Parenthood empower women to make informed decisions about their health. Defunding Planned Parenthood would inevitably reduce access to quality health care, disproportionately affecting the uninsured, underinsured and low-income Americans.
Make no mistake. The Trump administration is engaged in an all-out attack on women’s access to health care. They don’t believe women should be able to see the doctors and nurses they know and trust. It’s truly shameful.
Our Judiciary Committee investigation is not over. Several significant questions remain unanswered about the June 9 Trump Tower meeting and the numerous other contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian associates.
26 witnesses have refused to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into Russian interference and potential obstruction of justice. That's why our investigation must continue
We should expand access to health care, not barring patients from seeing doctors they trust so the president can fulfill his campaign promises. Title X funded health centers like Planned Parenthood provide essential health care to low-income, uninsured and underinsured patients.
Every dollar invested in the Title X family planning program saves more than seven dollars in Medicaid costs. The only reason to bar trusted providers like Planned Parenthood is an ideological attack at the expense of women’s health. It’s despicable.

Senate Republicans used the blue-slip tradition, which requires both home-state senators to sign off on judicial nominees, to block 18 Obama nominees. Now they have eliminated the guarantee that blue slips will be honored for Democrats: https://t.co/rGyoxWUjKV #CourtsMatter
Relentless obstruction of President Obama’s judicial nominees allowed Senate Republicans to hand President Trump 112 vacancies on day 1 of his presidency. In contrast, President Obama entered office with just 53 vacancies. Our report: https://t.co/rGyoxWCITn  #CourtsMatter
In order to stack the courts for generations, Republicans are dismantling a Senate tradition that ensures consultation and consensus with home-state senators. Through advice and consent, the Senate is meant to be a check on the president, not a rubber stamp.
Trump nominees have been incredibly young, allowing them to reshape our courts for generations. Nine of Pres. Trump’s first 15 confirmed circuit court nominees, or 60 percent, are in their 40s. By comparison, only one of Pres. Obama’s first 15 confirmed nominees was in their 40s.
While Pres. Obama’s first circuit court nominees were approved with overwhelming bipartisan votes, Pres. Trump has largely put forward controversial nominees outside the mainstream. 10 of President Trump’s first 15 circuit court nominees were confirmed with fewer than 60 votes.
With a Republican president, Senate Republicans are moving judicial nominees at breakneck speed.  President Trump’s first 15 circuit court nominees took half the time to confirm — an average of 131 days — compared to 254 days for President Obama’s first 15 circuit court nominees.
The facts are clear: Senate Republicans are stacking our courts with nominees outside the mainstream. After eight years of unprecedented obstruction of President Obama’s nominees, they are remaking the courts in record time. Our report:  https://t.co/rGyoxWCITn  #CourtsMatter
Thankful to hear that law enforcement has the situation at Highland High School in Palmdale under control and a suspect in custody. My thoughts are with the students and community. No community should have to experience this fear.
Circuit and district courts are final justice for most Americans, hearing ~400,000 cases per year. Republican efforts to stack the courts could affect civil rights, women’s rights and LGBT rights for generations by rolling back hard-fought progress.  https://t.co/rGyoxWCITn

The torture program was illegal at the time based on international treaties the U.S. is signatory to, including the Convention Against Torture and Geneva Convention, but no one has ever been held accountable. Gina Haspel was intimately involved and should not lead the agency.
Average Americans face unconscionable Rx drug prices but rather than fighting to help, President Trump gave the biggest companies a massive tax break – time for #ABetterDeal that lowers the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and families.
Justice Dept. policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political beliefs. We should be hiring the most qualified people possible for career positions, regardless of party. These allegations of bias must be investigated. https://t.co/3vqb2c6jyw
I will vote NO on the nomination of Gina Haspel. This nomination is bigger than one person. For the Senate to confirm someone so involved with the torture program to highest position at the CIA would in effect tell the world that we approve of what happened. I absolutely do not.

The president’s desire to fulfill a campaign promise has diminished our nation’s credibility, weakening our standing in the world. Future diplomatic efforts, including with Iran and North Korea, will be more difficult after abandoning an agreement we led the world in negotiating.
President Trump’s own Secretary of Defense, the U.S. intelligence community and the international inspectors all agree that Iran remains in full compliance of the nuclear agreement. There is absolutely no sound reason to exit at this time. https://t.co/YML9AyeyzI
President Obama led the world in negotiating an agreement that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. President Trump abandoned that leadership role, placing a wedge between us and our strongest allies. https://t.co/YML9AxWXIa
Driftnets kill more dolphins and porpoises off the coast of California than the entire West Coast combined. Now, we can finally phase out their use in California’s waters, just like the rest of the country, and transition to more sustainable methods. https://t.co/7vMDPBdyZg
I urge the president to reconsider and work with our partners to improve the deal we have today. Withdrawing may force the president to sanction our closest allies, and may give Iran pretext to violate the terms of the strongest nuclear agreement ever negotiated.
Every concern President Trump cited about Iran (support for terrorism, human rights violations, destabilizing activities etc.) has just become much more difficult to address now that we no longer have an agreement that prevents Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Despite the U.S. Intel Community and IAEA stating Iran is in compliance, the president decided to withdraw for concerns outside of Iran’s nuclear program. Addressing Iran’s support for terror and ballistic missile program will only be harder by alienating our partners and allies.
A nuclear-armed Iran poses a grave threat to U.S. national security. The Iran agreement forever prohibits Iran from developing nuclear weapons &amp; by every account it is working. Withdrawing from the nuclear agreement may spark a nuclear crisis in the world’s most volatile region.
Everything President Obama has done, this president wants to undo. An agreement that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is one thing that should never be undone just to satisfy a campaign promise.
It’s downright cruel to intentionally separate children from their parents as a way to punish immigrants, especially those seeking asylum. This policy betrays our values. We can’t lead the world on issues of human rights if we’re taking babies away from their mothers.
Pres. Trump is expected to withdraw today from the most stringent nuclear weapons agreement ever negotiated. The ranking members of 12 Senate committees have sent the president a clear message: keep the agreement &amp; work with our allies to address Iran’s destabilizing behavior. https://t.co/j4AQJO6IM4
#TeacherAppreciationWeek reminds us that funding Title II programs is so important. These programs allow educators to continue their professional development throughout their careers. We must invest in our teachers so our children can get a world-class education.

80% of Americans believe we should be doing more, not less, to improve fuel efficiency &amp; cut emissions. There’s no good reason to try to roll back fuel economy standards now. https://t.co/vtJLET4X2q
Fuel economy standards are the biggest step we’ve taken to combat climate change. Current standards are cutting our greenhouse gas pollution by nearly 6 billion metric tons. By 2030, we’d cut our oil use by almost as much as we import from OPEC. https://t.co/vtJLET4X2q
We’re on target to increase the average fuel economy to nearly 39 mpg in 2020 and more than 50 mpg in 2025. But President Trump seems determined to undermine that progress. https://t.co/vtJLESNlDQ

In the U.S., these nets are already banned in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii. However, they are still used off the coast of California. It’s time to phase them out and encourage more sustainable methods of fishing.
Driftnets, often more than a mile in length, are left in the ocean overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. Sixty other marine species, including whales, dolphins, sea lions, sea turtles, fish and sharks, can also become entangled in the nets, injuring or killing them.
The use of one type of fishing gear in California - large mesh driftnets -  is killing more dolphins and porpoises than everywhere else on the West Coast combined. Our bipartisan bill will remove these harmful driftnets from our oceans. https://t.co/06fr7Ut8pG

The Republican farm bill would weaken nutrition programs that low-income Americans, including children &amp; the elderly, depend on.

In 2016, the United States accepted more than 15,000 Syrian refugees. More than four months into 2018, we’ve accepted just 11 refugees. The United States must open its arms to those who have experienced the unspeakable horrors of the Syrian civil war. https://t.co/rFlzWVCQuL
If President Trump wants to address the humanitarian catastrophe that is the Syrian civil war, he should fulfill our obligation to accept refugees. We have admitted only ELEVEN Syrian refugees this year. Completely unacceptable!

National Park visitors spent approx. $18.4 billion in local economies in 2016, supporting more than 300,000 jobs. This fee increase will make it harder for families to visit their parks, hurting the local economies of the communities around the parks
The fee increase is supposed to address the $11.6 billion maintenance backlog, but at the same time, the Trump administration also wants to cut the National Park Service’s budget by more than $472 million.
Secretary Zinke’s decision to raise national park entrance fees is the wrong approach to fixing the @NatlParkService maintenance backlog. Our bill, the National Park Service Legacy Act, would address the backlog without raising entrance fees for national park visitors.

Republicans control the House, Senate and White House – if they really wanted to balance the budget, they could. But a constitutional amendment won’t eliminate the hard choices that Republicans have repeatedly refused to grapple with.
President Trump &amp; Republicans are now trying to claw back critical investments from the just-passed funding bill. Republicans are in the majority and wrote the bill. A deal is a deal. Reneging less than a month later is ridiculous and will poison the appropriations process.
The surplus during the Clinton era was partly the result of making sure the wealthiest Americans were paying an appropriate tax rate. If Republicans really cared about deficits, they wouldn’t have jammed through a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy that wasn’t paid for.
It’s a simple fact that America’s population is getting older, and older people generally require more government services. The solution to this debt problem is increasing revenue, not cutting vital programs that millions depend on. https://t.co/Nzqvj9Nekz

California manufacturing and agriculture jobs are at risk due to the President Trump’s entirely unnecessary trade war. If he continues down this path our industries could suffer long-term damage and lose market-share to exports from other countries.
China is one of the world’s largest markets for wine. A 15% tariff on American wines will make it harder for California winemakers to compete with their counterparts in New Zealand, Chile and Australia. President Trump should be making business easier for our growers, not harder.
California grows 100% of the almonds, walnuts and raisins exported to China. President Trump’s trade war means all three products will now be subject to a 15% tariff by China. The president must take steps to protect our agriculture industry from harm.
Glad to see the Federal Court in Massachusetts uphold the state’s #AssualtWeaponsBan. Five courts of appeals have also upheld assault weapons bans. Weapons of war are not protected by the 2nd amendment and we must get them off our streets. https://t.co/UsXTvHRpAK

Phthalates are harmful chemicals that pose a health risk to pregnant women and can lower testosterone levels for men. In children, they have been linked to learning and behavior problems, and have contributed to birth defects in boys.
87% of Americans want a DACA fix, Democrats are ready to find one when President Trump decides to get serious about fixing a problem he created but refuses to solve.
In order to qualify for DACA, you must have lived in the U.S. since at least 2007. President Trump is wrong. DACA is not encouraging people to cross illegally into the U.S. New arrivals are not eligible under DACA.
At the White House, I asked President Trump to support a clean DACA bill. He immediately agreed. A day later, he walked that commitment back and has ultimately opposed every single bipartisan bill to protect Dreamers.
It was wonderful to spend some time with women who are leading the way in our business and tech communities. Thank you @SVLeadershipGrp for organizing an excellent roundtable! https://t.co/BnDkcXoyaP
The EPA wants to overturn strong vehicle emission standards that are working. Cars are becoming more fuel efficient and consumers are saving money at the pump. https://t.co/eEyWj3gAPY
The EPA is willfully ignoring the fact that we already have one national standard and it’s working. Automakers are on track to raise fuel efficiency to more than 50 mpg by 2025 and at lower costs than expected. There simply is no reason to walk away from that progress. https://t.co/P1H1SGkRlP
Democrats worked in good faith for months to come to an agreement to protect Dreamers. We agreed to support flawed bills that included provisions we oppose, like funding for the border wall, to get it done, but the president still said ‘no.’ He walked away—not Democrats.
President Trump is absolutely wrong on DACA. He unilaterally rescinded DACA—for no reason—and has rejected every single bipartisan proposal that would protect Dreamers from deportation. It’s simply false to say that Democrats walked away from the table.

I believe we can finally end this epidemic of gun violence. I have great hope in this new generation of young leaders. They marched in over 800 different cities, millions of people over the weekend and they are eager for a change.
We passed an assault weapons ban in 1994 and it worked. It reduced the number of people killed or wounded over that 10-year period. And after it ended in 2004, deaths and shootings quickly escalated.
Today we have 15 million assault weapons in the U.S. These are guns modeled after military weapons and then sold to civilians. For what? You can’t use it for hunting. You don’t need it for defense. What do you really need it for?

In 2016 alone, 198 California families reported abductions by a parent. Our resolution raises awareness of this important issue in the hopes that we can continue to help parents who find themselves in this terrible situation.
It’s hard to imagine a more devastating situation for parents than their children being taken to or retained in a foreign country. Unfortunately, this happens more frequently than we think &amp; it’s incredibly difficult for parents to get their children back. https://t.co/6jciMD1lBx

Cambridge Analytica’s alleged exploits during the 2016 election are shocking.

I am greatly disturbed by President Trump’s use of twitter to intimidate those working on the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Current Justice Dept regulations protect Special Counsel Mueller and the Sen. Judiciary Committee should pass legislation codifying the regs. https://t.co/y4KStLt5Ir

Santa Barbara County, stay safe as the storm rolls through. Continue to monitor https://t.co/DkjcM2hd14 for the latest news and warnings. Remember to abide by all evacuation orders and warnings.
I see no reason why the Trump administration can’t make public which 21 states were targeted by Russian interference efforts during the 2016 election. Americans have a right to know if their state was targeted and if so, how their state is protecting future elections. https://t.co/EMSDrLQ583
Sex traffickers sell their victims on websites like Backpage. A congressional investigation showed Backpage knew about these ads and reaped profits. It’s time we pass #SESTA and start holding accountable websites like Backpage.  #StopSexTrafficking
Websites shouldn’t be profiting and encouraging sex trafficking on their platforms with impunity. I support the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers act to get this content off the Internet and hold websites responsible for promoting trafficking crimes #StopSexTrafficking #SESTA
Websites that facilitate sex trafficking – like Backpage -- must be held accountable. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act would give victims the ability to seek justice from websites that advertise sex trafficking. #StopSexTrafficking #SESTA

California has led the country in protecting women’s access to health care. I strongly support California’s FACT Act, a law to ensure women have access to accurate information. #EndtheLies
Many federal laws inform patients, consumers and workers of their rights. California’s FACT Act is no different. Ensuring women have access to factual information about the law in no way violates the First Amendment. #EndtheLies
California is a leader in ensuring women have accurate information about how to access health care and their legal rights. That’s why I joined @SenKamalaHarris in filing a Supreme Court amicus brief in support of California’s FACT Act. #EndtheLies
The Judiciary Committee must get answers from Cambridge Analytica and Trump campaign officials. Today I called on Chairman Grassley to support our request for documents and interviews.
I first called on Cambridge Analytica to provide documents and answer questions back in OCTOBER. To receive cooperation, we need bipartisan support.
@karoun I’ve said all along that Mueller is protected by DOJ regs from being fired. The regs state Mueller can only be fired for cause, and Rosenstein has said repeatedly there is no cause. Rules are clear, but I also support legislation to codify this protection.

Special Counsel Mueller is a lifelong Republican. He's universally respected and will follow the facts. His investigation must continue without political interference. The American people will not stand for efforts to impede his work.
It's incumbent on Republicans to make clear that they would not accept the firing of Special Counsel Mueller. If Republicans don’t condemn these attacks on the special counsel’s investigation, they are complicit in the president's efforts to undermine it.
Congratulations to my good friend, @RepMarcyKaptur! Today she became the longest-serving woman in the House of Representatives after more than 35 years of public service. #WomenMakeHistory #WomensHistoryMonth
The president's statements today are unprecedented in their venal nature. They make crystal clear that Andy McCabe's firing is part of the effort to undermine law enforcement and Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. The president must cease and desist with these attacks.
The firing of Andy McCabe is part of a pattern to root out top law enforcement officials. Special Counsel Mueller must not become part of that pattern. The rule of law and health of our democracy is at stake.
The census must not be turned into a political weapon. That's why we're calling on the Justice Department to answer questions about which Trump administration officials advocated for a question on the census about citizenship status. https://t.co/r0SzJoGZFD

#NationalPark visitors spent approx. $18.4 billion in local economies in 2016, supporting more than 300,000 jobs. This fee increase would make it difficult for many Americans to visit and hurt communities around the parks
If @SecZinke wants to get serious about addressing the NPS backlog without making the ational parks unaffordable for most Americans, they’ll back our bill. https://t.co/wrqnpPgvYB
The fee increase is supposedly meant to address the @NatlParkService’s $11.6 billion maintenance backlog, but the Trump administration also wants to cut the National Park Service’s budget by more than $500 million.
.@SecretaryZinke has proposed raising peak season fees at 17 National Parks, including three in California: @YosemiteNPS, @JoshuaTreeNP &amp; @SequoiaKingsNPS.
.@SecretaryZinke claims too many people visit our #NationalParks without paying. He’s wrong – free entry passes are only available to active military, individuals with permanent disabilities, children and park volunteers.
I'm so sorry to learn of the passing of Rep. @LouiseSlaughter. She entered public service at a time when there were few women in the arena and blazed a trial for countless others. You couldn't find a better advocate for women in Congress. My thoughts are with her family.

Abuse of prescription drugs are a major contributor to the opioid crisis. The Opioid Quota Reform Act of 2018 will empower the DEA to set more accurate quotas to help prevent opioid overdose deaths while also maintaining legitimate access. https://t.co/DsEGO0d6sD
Deaths due to opioid abuse are at EPIDEMIC levels. Allowing the DEA to consider abuse rates and overdose deaths when establishing quotas for opioid production is a no brainer. With our new bill the DEA would be able to more effectively prevent opioid diversion and abuse.
A child’s opportunity for success should not be left to chance, we must do everything we can do to support our public school system. Enable our students, empower our families and endow our educators with the tools and resources to be successful. #PublicSchoolsWeek
According to the most recent data available, we had a nationwide high school graduation rate of 84%, the highest in U.S. history. We should recognize this during #PublicSchoolsWeek, but keep working hard to top that mark next year.
Faced with a rising tide of gun victims, it’s unsurprising doctors share our priorities: ban assault weapons, expand background checks. We know there are steps we can take to combat gun violence. How much longer must we wait to take them?
As a country we can’t allow children being shot to death in school to become routine. We must break the cycle of discussion and turn to action. Powerful piece from trauma surgeons on the front lines. https://t.co/8JwiXwWTBY

The ATF director acknowledged in our hearing that banning bump stocks through regulation is likely to be challenged in court, and that the best way to achieve a ban on bump stocks is passing a law. If Republicans want to get bump stocks off our streets, they will support my bill!
We've heard the students who participated in the #NationalSchoolWalkout loud and clear. I'll never stop fighting for stronger laws:

Ban on assault weapons and bump stocks
Universal background checks
Age 21 to buy assault weapons
Barring dangerous individuals from having guns
.@Dicks Sporting Goods is a HUGE business, 700+ stores. CEO Ed Stack knew it was risky to stop selling assault rifles &amp; high-capacity magazines. But he still did it! A great example!

Students know all too well the devastation of mass shootings. Today and on March 24th they are making their voices heard! Find your local march and let’s be loud and clear: America wants meaningful #GunReform NOW!
Will Republicans listen to students who have taken a stand against gun violence or continue to block bills that most Americans agree with? #NationalSchoolWalkout
A generation of students has grown up in a mass-shooting era. It’s challenging enough to educate our children and prepare them for success in life without active-shooter drills. We can, should and must make our communities safe! #NationalSchoolWalkout
We must act. We cannot continue to sit in this room week after week and simply do nothing. High school students who have lost their friends are literally begging us to take action to get these guns off the streets and out of our schools. #EnoughisEnough

I’m worried that my colleagues may have forgotten where the path of deregulation ends. I oppose this bill for the simple reason that it goes too far in weakening the protections we put in place to prevent another financial crisis.
The bill we are considering in the Senate goes beyond targeted relief for small institutions. It would lift requirements for large banks in our country. The CBO says the probability of a large bank failing or another financial crisis would RISE if S. 2155 is passed into law!
I remember hearing from top financial officials 10 years ago about the potential for a total collapse of our economy. For those of us who were here, that was our fear: total collapse. https://t.co/Qzz7x3aYua

Arming teachers is an utterly ridiculous idea that teachers strongly oppose. Even trained law enforcement officers encounter extreme difficulty in the face of a heavily-armed shooter.

The Trump administration has once again attacked California to score political points. California shouldn’t be punished for shielding law-abiding immigrants from deportation. California will stand strong!
Targeting and arresting parents who have lived in this country for decades as they take their children to school is NOT what California stands for. I fully support @AGBecerra and his defense of California’s values.
I agree with @JerryBrownGov—an attempt by the Trump administration to go to war with California, the world's sixth largest economy, is foolish and will not succeed!
We just heard from families affected by gun violence, including those from Parkland, Newtown and Virginia Tech. Their stories are gut wrenching. I left that hearing emotional, angry and even more committed to continue to push to get weapons of war off the streets. #GunReformNow

If the administration really wants to make our communities safe, it will stop targeting law-abiding immigrants and separating families. We should prioritize dangerous criminals, not hardworking families.
Around 750,000 California children who are U.S. citizens have parents who are undocumented.  California is right to keep families together by protecting law-abiding parents who have lived here for decades.
Attorney General Sessions called California’s efforts “irrational and unfair.” Exactly the words I’d use to describe the targeting of immigrants who are working, paying taxes and follow the law instead of those with serious criminal records.

Reports from the @latimes that 26 farmworkers were arrested by ICE last week are deeply troubling. Workers who contribute to our country shouldn’t be targeted for deportation just to score political points. We must pass my bill to provide farmworkers a path to citizenship.
An executive order banning bump stocks would be tied up in courts for YEARS and do nothing to prevent their sale in the meantime! A legislative fix is the only way to ensure the safety of our communities.
The ATF has already said it lacks the ability to ban bump stocks. If the president is serious about getting these deadly devices off our streets, he will support our bill and call on Republicans to stop blocking it.

La decisión de la Corte Suprema sobre #DACA no disminuye la necesidad de que el Congreso actúe. Tenemos el deber moral de abordar la crisis humanitaria que el presidente Trump creó al cancelar el programa. #ProtectDreamers

Do we want America to be a country where students are shot to death in their classrooms? I will never accept an America that puts so little value on the lives of children. The good news is the vast majority of Americans feel the same way. We can change things. #GunReformNow
Democrats have repeatedly negotiated in good faith to #ProtectDreamers but President Trump has torpedoed every single one of our efforts. It is time he step aside and let Congress solve the crisis he alone created.
Los demócratas han negociado de buena fe para proteger a los #Dreamers, pero el presidente Trump ha rechazado cada uno de nuestros esfuerzos. Es hora de que permita que el Congreso resuelva la crisis que él mismo creó. #ProtectDreamers

We've come a long way in the Senate, but we still have a long way to go. So my message as #WomensHistoryMonth gets under way is for more women to get involved, engage in your communities, make change happen. And keep up the fight. https://t.co/8tTS6t4uW2
A review of the world’s gun laws shows that countries with far lower gun death rates than ours make it harder for potentially dangerous individuals to get their hands on guns. https://t.co/u7j6iFlkMk #GunReformNow
People often ask me what it will take to ban assault weapons and get weapons of war off the streets. The answer is we need to match the passion and intensity on the other side. We need to make clear that reducing gun violence is a TOP priority.
Young people give me hope that we'll finally be able to strengthen our nation's guns laws.  We've never seen this kind of mobilization of students after a mass shooting. They aren't going to live with the status quo any longer. #GunReformNow
The United States has four percent of the world’s population but 42 percent of the world’s guns. There’s no mystery as to why our death rate from guns is so high. It’s not mental illness or video games. It easy access to guns! #GunReformNow
Two more companies are taking a stand to reduce gun violence.  You wouldn’t be seeing companies changing policies on guns and distancing themselves from the NRA if things weren’t changing.  https://t.co/DtJVjyjync

The statistics are absolutely shocking &amp; the evidence is clear. The gun lobby can’t keep pretending we don’t know why we’re the only industrialized nation plagued by mass shootings. Republicans need to back commonsense gun laws to protect our communities! https://t.co/CQRjujpokr

In shooting after shooting, friends and families have seen the warning signs that the shooter may commit an act of violence. Our bill would help states that want to create a legal avenue for families to obtain gun violence prevention orders.
This @LaTimesOpinion piece is exactly right. Congress needs to act to ban bump stocks. https://t.co/AIS1M94sE1
The gun lobby needs to put up or shut up on stopping people who exhibit “red flags” from getting guns. If it doesn’t support our Gun Violence Restraining Order Act then it’s all just talk.
Machine guns have been banned for decades but a loophole in the law allows bump stocks. These dangerous devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the rate of machine guns. Our bill is the ONLY way to ban them.
According to research, since the Aurora theater shooting, the average death toll in a mass shooting has been 24.4 when an assault weapons is used. When another firearm is used, the average death toll has been 7.5. Assault weapons make shootings FAR MORE deadly. #BanAssaultWeapons
As African-American History Month closes, I’d like to highlight how important it is that federal courts reflect our diverse communities. President Trump has NOT advanced that goal. He’s nominated just ONE African-American judicial nominee out of 80 total nominees. #CourtsMatter

BREAKING: Senator @JeffFlake and I just introduced our bill to raise the age for purchasing assault weapons to 21.  If you can’t buy a beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy a weapon of war like an AR-15. While we need to do more, this is a commonsense step forward. #GunReformNow
Ensuring women know their rights and have access to factual information about the law in no way violates the First Amendment. Let’s ensure women have that access. SCOTUS  should uphold California’s FACT Act.  https://t.co/aHWFRpWpuA

The president is WRONG on bump stocks. Banning them can ONLY be done by passing my legislation, or else it’s going to be tied  up in court for years. Anyone who says they support banning bump stocks needs to support our bill. #BanBumpStocks
We’ve seen countless families and communities broken by gun violence. I’ve met with many victims and their pain never leaves me. Gun violence is a public health crisis in this country and we need a comprehensive response. #GunReformNow
Through their pain, the students from Parkland have been demanding lawmakers take action to make sure an AR-15 can never be used to perpetrate another mass shooting. That’s why I’m calling for a Judiciary Committee hearing on our bill to #BanAssaultWeapons.
This week we’ll be introducing legislation to bring the rules for AR-15 sales in line with handguns, which already require a minimum 21 years of age. While we need to do more, this is a commonsense step forward. #GunReformNow
Accessories like bump stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns. The ONLY way to guarantee these dangerous devices are taken off the streets is to pass my bill. #BanBumpStocks
Weapons like the AR-15 are designed to hunt people, not deer. They are designed to kill the greatest number of people in the shortest amount of time. We need to get these weapons of war off our streets. #BanAssaultWeapons
The tide is turning: A Republican House member comes out in support of banning assault weapons. https://t.co/M4rRHOBxMX #BanAssaultWeapons
Russian interference in our elections cannot be condoned. We all need to know what happened in 2016 and what actions Russia continues to take today. Robert Mueller’s investigation must proceed unhindered, and rebutting the misleading Nunes memo is a step toward that goal.
The Schiff memo is a well-considered rebuttal to the misinformation in the Nunes memo. As I said when it was released, the Nunes memo was an attempt to undermine the Steele dossier and Robert Mueller’s investigation, and it shouldn’t have seen the light of day.
I’m pleased the Schiff memo is finally being made available for the public to review. It will help Americans understand why the Nunes memo was wrong.
Must-read from a trauma surgeon on the damage caused by an AR-15: "[The bullet] does not have to actually hit an artery to damage it and cause catastrophic bleeding. Exit wounds can be the size of an orange." https://t.co/sqICPPDZsB #BanAssaultWeapons
The president’s obsession with California is growing more outrageous by the day. His attacks are not only mean-spirited, they’re patently false. https://t.co/9V4LWRr9au
We’ve seen in mass shooting after mass shooting that family members have seen the warning signs. The problem is these families often have no legal avenue to bar their loved ones from obtaining guns. Our bill changes that. #GVRO
The gun lobby says that we need to take guns away from those who exhibit ‘red flags.’ You can only do that through a legal process and only a handful of states have one in place. If the gun lobby is serious, it’ll support our Gun Violence Restraining Order Act. #GVRO
Families have little recourse if they want to ensure their loved ones do not get their hands on guns that they could use to kill themselves or others. Our bill would help states establish a court process to allow that to happen. #GVRO
Machine guns have been banned for decades but a loophole in the law allows bump stocks. These dangerous devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at the rate of machine guns. Our bill is the only way to ban them. #StudentsStandUp
Here's how we strengthen background checks: Ensure states and federal agencies contribute information; expand background checks to ALL sales, and close the loophole that allows sales to proceed if background checks are not completed in 72 hours. #StudentsStandUp
Here are the facts: Our current assault weapons ban covers specific weapons AND weapons that accept a detachable magazine and have ONE military characteristic. The 1994 ban required two characteristics. Our current bill IMPROVES upon on the 1994 bill. #StudentsStandUp
In shooting after shooting, friends and families have seen the warning signs that the shooter may commit an act of violence. I’ve introduced a bill that would help states that want to create a legal avenue for families to obtain gun violence prevention orders. #StudentsStandUp
The assault weapons ban was effective. When the ban was in place, the number of gun massacres fell by 37 percent. The number of people dying from gun massacres fell by 43 percent. Republicans blocked an extension of the ban. We're fighting to reinstate it. #StudentsStandUp

One common thread that runs through mass shootings is the use of an AR-15 military-style assault weapon. It's time to get these weapons of war off our streets. #StudentsStandUp
An AR-15 is capable of killing large numbers of people in a matter of minutes. Why are gun dealers allowed to sell these deadly weapons to individuals who are 18 when they can only sell handguns to individuals over 21? It makes NO SENSE. #GunReformNow
Allowing gun dealers to sell AR-15s to teenagers when they’re not allowed to sell them handguns is a dangerous policy that makes no sense. Gun dealers should NOT be able to sell these types of weapons to anyone under 21! #GunReformNow
Gun dealers are ALREADY barred from selling handguns to anyone younger than 21. It makes NO SENSE to allow them to sell AR-15s to someone 18, 19 or 20! #GunReformNow
Proud to cosponsor a Senate resolution to recognize the significance of #BlackHistoryMonth and honor the contributions of African Americans to the history and culture of our country. https://t.co/4SYpZQxjxJ
If the president really wants to ban bump stocks, he will support our bill. If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years. Legislation is the ONLY answer. #BanBumpStocks
Happy #PresidentsDay! Today we honor the leaders who put the country ahead of themselves to ensure our nation and its people could thrive.
Families have little recourse if they want to ensure their loved ones don't get their hands on guns that they could use to kill themselves or others. Our bill would help states establish a court process to allow families to obtain gun violence restraining orders. #GunReformNow
A generation of students has grown up with active shooter drills as the norm. They are saying "enough" and I couldn't be more proud. Together we will fight to strengthen our gun safety laws. #GunReformNow

A big part of the Senate's responsibility to “advise and consent” on judicial nominees is the blue-slip tradition. It gives senators the opportunity to have a say on nominees from their states. It's worked for 100 years, but Republicans are getting rid of it. #CourtsMatter
Fact-Check: No Democratic chair of the Judiciary Committee has EVER held a hearing for a judicial nominee over the objection of a Republican senator. #CourtsMatter
Today Republicans on the Judiciary Committee did away with a 100-year-old Senate tradition to push through President Trump's controversial judicial nominees. It’s a HUGE mistake for the committee to cede senators' power on judges to the president. #CourtsMatter
Republicans have blocked every solution for Dreamers. I'm beyond heartbroken, I’m disgusted. If we don’t act, these young immigrants will face the threat of deportation. My message to Dreamers is to not give up hope. We’re going to keep working. #ProtectDreamers

WATCH LIVE: We’re advocating for a bill that strengthens the protection of young athletes in amateur athletic organizations like USA Gymnastics. Thrilled to be joined by Jeanette Antolin, @Dmoceanu and my congressional colleagues. https://t.co/XmhST3z5vy
BREAKING: By a vote of 406-3, the House just passed our bill to protect young athletes from abuse. Passage of our bill wouldn’t have been possible without the courage of women who came forward to share their deeply painful experiences. Today is their day. #TimesUp
This Republican-led Congress should stop wasting time with bills that are out of date, out of touch and unconstitutional. We can’t turn the clock back on women’s reproductive health. https://t.co/HFAWUW6CUf
Senate Republicans are bringing up a bill today to undermine a woman’s constitutional right to make decisions about her own body. Awful legislation. #NoAbortionBan
My heart goes out to the victims of the #KabulAttack and their families. More than 100 innocent lives were lost and more than 200 injured in this senseless act of terror.
On International Holocaust Remembrance Day we turn our attention to a dark era of world history. #WeRemember the millions of Jewish lives lost and recommit ourselves to the pledge of “Never Again.”
USA Gymnastics put money and medals over athlete safety at every turn. It's a welcome step that the entire board of USA Gymnastics is resigning.
I noted in June that President Trump does not have the authority to fire Bob Mueller. I also said that firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein in order to replace Mueller would be a blatant move to subvert the law. Nothing has changed between then and now.
We put the United States on track to cut car emissions in half by 2025, saving Americans billions at the pump. Read my @SFChronicle op-ed on why the Trump administration shouldn’t undermine that progress. https://t.co/i4bl7Y7NjD
I greatly admire @CecileRichards and her steadfast commitment to protecting women's access to health care in the face of relentless attacks. She is one of the strongest women I know! Thank you Cecile. #IStandWithPP
The take or leave it proposal put out by the White House will not make our country safer and will only serve to encourage illegal immigration because families will not be able to lawfully reunite.
President Trump and Republicans will not be allowed to use Dreamers as a bargaining chip for their wish list of anti-immigrant policies. It's time to enact the Dream Act, which has bipartisan support. #DreamActNow
The Trump administration is holding only ONE public meeting in California for their disastrous offshore drilling plan, hundreds of miles from many of the communities that would be affected. Read our letter telling them to come listen to all of our coastal communities: https://t.co/6zwSGWwfdz
The time to pass our bill to protect athletes is now. Time and again, I’ve seen how the failure of Congress to act when an issue is at the forefront of the national conversation means that Congress never acts at all. We will not allow that to happen here.
Our bipartisan Senate bill to protect athletes was passed unanimously. It's supported by 270 organizations and athletes, including a number who survived Larry Nassar’s abuse. It had a hearing. We negotiated language. It was fine-tuned for months. The House needs to pass it NOW!
Earlier this month, we called on the administration to reject this request. A question on citizenship would undermine the census, leading to broad inaccuracies across the board, from how congressional districts are drawn to how government funds are distributed. https://t.co/K6zmsW3sBA
The Justice Department’s request is incredibly alarming given the Trump administration's rhetoric and actions toward immigrants and minority groups. https://t.co/EG3jyhRrCJ
Democratic chairs of the Judiciary Committee have NEVER, EVER held a hearing for a judicial nominee over the objection of a Republican senator.  A Republican chair has now held two hearings over the objection of Democratic senators in ONE YEAR. #CourtsMatter
Just one year into the Trump administration, Chairman Grassley has held a second hearing for a judicial nominee over the objection of a home-state senator, @SenatorBaldwin. I object to this decision in the strongest possible terms.
Our bill to protect athletes by requiring mandatory reporting of abuse and holding organizations like USA Gymnastics accountable has passed the Senate. Now the House of Representatives needs to pass it immediately so it can be signed into law. https://t.co/1rb5B4pskp
I’m so proud of all the women who came forward to share their painful stories. We must make sure amateur athletic organizations are prioritizing safety instead of money and medals. https://t.co/lX626JrbX8
I'm thrilled to hear that @SenDuckworth is expecting her second child. Her ability to meet the demands of work and family is inspiring. As a country, we need to do more to help all mothers do the same.

A woman’s right to control her own body allows her to control her future. We must never take that right for granted. We must always fight for it. #7in10forRoe
In the first year of the Trump administration, we’ve seen attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and restrict access to birth control; the creation of new government offices to undermine women’s health care; and judges who oppose women’s privacy rights. We must FIGHT! #RiseUp4Roe
As we mark the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions is under relentless attack from President Trump and Republicans in Congress. We must ALL recommit ourselves to protecting women's rights. #RiseUp4Roe
National governing bodies like USA Gymnastics must be held accountable for their failures – child safety should never take a backseat to money and medals. https://t.co/DCHggU2yqh

It’s been three months since Republicans let community health center funding expire. While wasting time cutting taxes for the rich, they’ve put access to health care for the 25 million people who rely on these health centers at risk.
If the president and Republicans truly cared about Dreamers, they’d help us pass the Dream Act bill right now!
President Trump has said that DACA recipients have nothing to worry about. Well, I’ve met with them, I’ve listened to them and they ARE worried. They’re worried that without the Dream Act, their families could be ripped apart at any moment.
Two days after wasting $1 trillion on tax cuts for the rich, Republicans now claim we have no money for children’s health insurance. I can’t imagine anything more heartless than ignoring our most vulnerable while giving more money to millionaires and billionaires.
After wasting a year trying to repeal Obamacare and cut taxes for the rich, Republicans left no time to govern. One day before a potential government shutdown, they passed yet another short-term funding bill that ignores our nation’s priorities.
While Republican’s are rushing home for the holidays, thousands of Dreamers are left wondering if this will be their last Christmas in the only country they’ve called home. That breaks my heart.
I hope that Republicans will finally realize this isn’t the right way to govern. You’re not representing the country when you govern one month at a time and rush through poorly-written bills that only benefit certain special interests.
Republicans came up with a government funding bill at the very last minute that ignores many of our highest-priority needs, including passing the Dream Act and coming up with a long-term solution for children’s health insurance.
Sería una tragedia dejar que estos jóvenes sufran aun mas sin tener la certeza de poder quedarse en nuestro país.

UPDATE: House Republicans are voting on the #GOPTaxPlan again today because of mistakes. This is what happens when you rush to pass a bad bill!
Senate Republicans just gave corporations and the richest Americans an early Christmas present at the expense of middle-class families. #GOPTaxPlan https://t.co/qQySvidtlc
To review, the #GOPTaxPlan:
 
     • Unfairly harms Californians by limiting state and local deductions.
     • Raises taxes on millions of middle-class families.
     • Balloons the federal deficit.
 
The Senate will vote on this bill in a matter hours. It's a disaster.
BREAKING: The House just passed the disastrous #GOPTaxPlan. I’ll be voting NO on the bill when it comes to the Senate and I call on my colleagues to do the same. This bill is NOT tax reform. It’s tax cuts for the rich and so-called “trickle-down economics” that DOES NOT work.
The @MercNews editorial board calls out the misleading job-creation promises in the #GOPTaxPlan. We must stop Republicans from rushing this terrible bill into law. https://t.co/kyInDE4cAv

The Santa Rosa Press Democrat editorial board is spot on. If the #GOPTaxPlan was a good bill, Republican leaders wouldn’t try to jam it through before Christmas. Where were the congressional hearings? @NorthBayNews https://t.co/d7wFQC6ZVV
The San Diego Union-Tribune called the #GOPTaxPlan a “huge gamble.” This bill is based on assumptions that may never see the light of day. We can’t base our tax system on hope. We need to defeat this bill. https://t.co/WEigO6zVRt
The @SacBeeEditBoard calls the #GOPTaxPlan a “monstrosity.” I couldn’t agree more. The bill raises taxes on many Californians and grows the federal deficit. I call on my Republican colleagues to reject this bill and start over. https://t.co/Dd5onaWB8A

The Republican tax bill will increase health care premiums in the individual market by 10 percent each year. Individuals who make just above the limit for financial help—around $48,000 per year—will be hit hardest. #GOPTaxScam
The Republican tax bill caps the mortgage interest deduction at $750,000 for new mortgages. In California, seven counties have average home prices that are more than $750,000: Alameda, Marin, Orange, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties. #GOPTaxScam
The Republican tax bill caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000. In 2015, more than 6 MILLION California households claimed the SALT deduction with an average deduction of $18,400. BOTTOM LINE: California families pay MORE so corporations pay LESS. #GOPTaxScam
It’s the height of hypocrisy for Republicans to vote for a tax cut that would add at least $1 trillion to the deficit after spending eight years railing against the national debt. #GOPTaxScam

I heard Deputy AG Rosenstein’s testimony today. He sees no reason to fire Special Counsel Mueller and says he was the “ideal choice for this task.”  I agree.
Climate change is wreaking havoc on the Arctic—why would we put more habitat in jeopardy and accelerate global warming? #ProtectTheArctic https://t.co/0X1zHtYgWM
There's an awful provision in the #GOPTaxPlan that would allow drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
GOOD NEWS: Our earthquake preparedness bill just unanimously passed out of its Senate committee. Now it’s on to the full Senate. We must be prepared for the next catastrophic earthquake and this bill gives our communities the tools they need to be ready. https://t.co/sFbT6SwHrl
Every Senate Republican voted last night to confirm Steven Grasz to a lifetime judgeship despite the fact that he was voted unanimously “NOT QUALIFIED” due to concerns that he could not be impartial. Biased judges on our courts should alarm every American. #CourtsMatter
Happy Hanukkah to those celebrating the Festival of Lights in California and around the world! I hope you enjoy the holiday surrounded by family and friends.
I asked Brett Talley last month about his failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest and online commentary. He never responded to my letter. https://t.co/1fH6yXNwiS #CourtsMatter
The #GOPTaxPlan undercuts America’s electric vehicle and renewable energy transformation. It would be senseless for Republicans to disrupt these new industries that are a key part of growing our economy and fighting climate change.
Thanks @JimmyKimmel, you’re absolutely right. Children’s health care is NOT negotiable. Congress needs to reauthorize CHIP funding immediately. It’s a no brainer! #FundCHIPNow https://t.co/bI5Ih1UIh8
Another disgusting tweet from Thin-Skinned Donald Trump. This man has a problem, plain and simple. He lashes out at women and doesn’t seem to be able to control his impulses. For the good of the nation, he should delete his account. https://t.co/0aoBA1ze8i
Our courts have a critical role in upholding women’s constitutional and civil rights, from health care to workplace discrimination. We must speak out against judges who are #BadforWomen. #CourtsMatter
Steven Grasz defended state efforts to deny Medicaid coverage of abortion to women who are raped, which is required by federal law. #BadForWomen #CourtsMatter
Don Willett said he “resisted” the idea that glass ceilings, pay equity, sexual discrimination and harassment were serious problems for women.  #BadforWomen #CourtsMatter
Kyle Duncan defended a law that would have made abortion nearly impossible to access in Texas. The Supreme Court disagreed and overturned the law. He’s #BadForWomen #CourtsMatter
Stephen Schwartz has been nominated to serve on a court he’s not licensed to practice before—but what he HAS done is argue against women’s access to contraception and reproductive healthcare. #BadforWomen #CourtsMatter
Brett Talley, rated unanimously “not qualified” by the American Bar Association, has called Roe v. Wade “indefensible.” #BadForWomen @ABAesq
John Bush, confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, said that Roe v. Wade was one of the two greatest tragedies in our country’s history. #BadForWomen #CourtsMatter
Many of President Trump’s judicial nominees have demonstrated a clear hostility toward women’s rights. If you care about women’s rights, you need to care about who sits on our federal courts. #BadForWomen #CourtsMatter
The passing of Mayor Ed Lee is a very sad day for San Francisco and all of us who knew him. My heart and thoughts are with Ed’s family and friends and the city I love.
Since 1989, only TWO of 1,755 nominees reviewed by the American Bar Association have been rated unanimously “not qualified” because they wouldn’t be objective. One is Steven Grasz, and Senate Republicans want to jam him through the Senate THIS WEEK. #CourtsMatter

President Trump created a crisis by ending the #DACA program to please his political base. Republicans must work with Democrats to solve that crisis. #DREAMActNow

In 1995, we passed a bill to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital IN THE CONTEXT of the Oslo peace process. Today, there are ZERO direct negotiations. By taking these actions now, there’s real potential to further inflame the Middle East.

The House Republican bill to expand the ability to carry concealed weapons would effectively allow states with the weakest gun laws to supersede states with the strongest gun laws, including California.
Before they take even a single step to reduce gun violence, House Republicans are pushing the NRA’s top priority. We won’t stop fighting these dangerous policies. #StopCCR

We can still defeat the #GOPTaxPlan. Keep making calls and tell Republicans: Don’t RAISE taxes on the middle class!
BREAKING: Republicans just jammed through their middle-class tax hike! This awful bill was written behind closed doors and introduced only hours ago. Outrageous!
UPDATE: Republicans finally released their 500-page tax cut bill—drafted ENTIRELY behind closed doors. We’re probably voting tonight, but NO ONE has read the bill! Unacceptable.

NEW THIS MORNING: Republicans are rewriting their bill in secret. They don’t have the votes, but it’s clear they’re DESPERATE to get SOMETHING, ANYTHING done. We have to keep up the pressure. #GOPTaxPlan

A 60-year-old in Fresno who makes $50,000 per year currently pays $727 per month.

A 60-year-old in Los Angeles who makes $50,000 per year currently pays $548 per month.

Under our bill, that person would SAVE $542 per month.

Under the Republican plan, that person would pay $54 MORE per month.
A 60-year-old in San Diego who makes $50,000 per year currently pays $652 per month.

Under our bill, that person would SAVE $248 per month.

Under the Republican plan, that person would pay $65 MORE per month.
A 60-year-old in Sacramento who makes $50,000 per year currently pays $905 per month.

Under our bill, that person would SAVE $501 per month.

Under the Republican plan, that person would pay $90 MORE per month.
A 60-year-old in San Francisco who makes $50,000 per year currently pays $946 per month. 

Under our bill, that person would SAVE $542 per month.

Under the Republican plan, that person would pay $94 MORE per month.
Democrats want to make health insurance more affordable for middle-class families. In contrast, the current #GOPTaxPlan would make insurance more expensive by sabotaging the individual market. Follow for examples of how middle-class families would be hurt.

FACT: 5 of the 9 Trump nominees confirmed to date have required a #blueslip from Democratic senators. All have received them. There has been NO obstruction to justify eliminating a 100-year-old Senate tool.
FACT: During the Obama administration, 18 judicial nominees were blocked because they did not receive a #blueslip from both home-state senators.
FACT: During the administrations of Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton, not ONE judge was confirmed without two blue slips.
FACT: The last time a judge was confirmed without two #blueslips was 1989.
FACT: Fewer than FIVE judges have been confirmed without two #blueslips in 100 years.
FACT: During the Obama administration, Democrats NEVER violated the #blueslip policy, even though Republicans used it to block many nominees.
FACT: In 2015 and 2016, Republicans used the #blueslip to block 9 Obama nominees:

I agree! California can’t afford the #GOPTaxPlan. https://t.co/G28unUK3VO
Not only is there inadequate funding for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Texas and Florida hurricane relief, but California wildfire victims were NOT included in the Trump administration’s disaster request. Completely unacceptable. https://t.co/I8fwegYKHY
It’s disgusting the White House is even considering lifting the trophy ban. I’ll fight this or any attempt to weaken protections for endangered elephants. https://t.co/gVJhpeZccy

I’ve called on the Trump administration to not raise visitor fees at Yosemite, Joshua Tree, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. https://t.co/R1lSdbSRlz
The White House’s request for disaster assistance did NOT include aid for California wildfire victims. That’s appalling! 

@SenHarris and I are working to secure wildfire funding before it passes Congress. https://t.co/Kt4fJI8reR
This says it all: "The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said on Thursday that the latest version of the Senate tax bill would effectively RAISE taxes for lower-income Americans by 2021." https://t.co/neWzlnrHdT #GOPTaxScam
In 2015 and 2016 ALONE, Republicans used the #blueslip to block these nine Obama nominees:

Rebecca Haywood
Lisabeth Tabor Hughes
Abdul Kallon
Myra Selby
Don Beatty
Mary Barzee Flores
Dax Lopez
Patricia Timmons-Goodson 
Anne Traum
The Republican tax cut bill was written to help the rich at the expense of the middle class. That’s the bottom line. https://t.co/aBhxhSmc6n
The lengths to which Republicans are going to jam extremely conservative and controversial nominees through the Senate is unprecedented. What’s happening is diminishing the Judiciary Committee and the Senate and undermining the independence of the federal judiciary. #CourtsMatter
Republicans shouldn’t have one blue slip policy for Democratic presidents and another for Republican presidents. In 2015 and 2016, Chairman Grassley refused to allow NINE Obama nominees to have hearings. #CourtsMatter
House Republicans just passed a bill that adds up to $12.1 billion to Californians’ tax bill each year. Why would California Republicans vote against their own constituents? https://t.co/Qvijvty0bE

As we approach the five-year anniversary of the horrifying shooting at Sandy Hook, it’s heartbreaking that we’ve made so little progress in preventing these shootings. Elementary schools like the one in Rancho Tehama Reserve shouldn’t have to prepare for mass shootings.
Is this a country that kicks people off of their health coverage to cut taxes for the top 1 percent? Repealing the Affordable Care Act in a tax-cut bill is outrageous. #GOPTaxScam
More than 15,000 scientists from 184 countries just issued a dire warning on climate change. The science is settled, we must #ActOnClimate before it’s too late. https://t.co/2Gy53GARir
The #GOPTaxPlan raises taxes on millions in the middle class. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would make their health care costs skyrocket too. The middle class can’t afford this awful bill.
I agree with our police officers, ending the deduction for state and local taxes is a bad idea. #GOPTaxPlan could force cuts to funding that first responders rely on to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/qzjUgjepFL
We need a tax plan that encourages companies to hire American workers. Instead, the #GOPTaxPlan would create a huge payday for the rich. https://t.co/3MQh79RUst
The House #GOPTaxPlan would make it even harder to build affordable housing in California. This is a bad bill! https://t.co/m4rotXt8Mc
The #GOPTaxPlan could trigger a $25 billion cut to Medicare. Seniors shouldn’t suffer so the rich can have a tax cut.  https://t.co/HDz10dFQ27
Affordable Care Act sign-ups are up nearly 50% over last year. Americans want quality, affordable health coverage. Senate Republicans are pushing a policy in their tax bill that would raise premiums another 10%. Disgraceful. #GOPTaxPlan
Sound the alarm! Senate Republicans’ tax-cut bill is now an attack on the Affordable Care Act. 13 million people will lose their health coverage if this passes! #GOPTaxPlan

Senate Republicans’ tax bill wipes out the deduction for state and local income, sales and property taxes. The 6 million Californians that claim this important middle-class deduction could see their taxes go up. #GOPTaxPlan
BREAKING: The Senate just passed our bill to prevent sex abuse in amateur athletics. This wouldn’t have been possible without the courage of women who came forward to say ‘ENOUGH is ENOUGH.’ Today is their day.
Senate Republicans’ tax bill would add $1.7 trillion to the deficit. That’s too steep a price tag for a bill that gives the top 1% a tax cut they don’t need! #GOPTaxPlan
Californians could pay up to $12.1 billion more a year in income taxes if the #GOPTaxPlan passes. Why are California Republicans not speaking out against this awful bill? https://t.co/bJFcjPVMD6
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid recipients shouldn’t be victims of the Republicans’ tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.
Senate Republican tax bill adds $1.7 trillion to the deficit, creating an excuse for Republicans to make drastic cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the future.  #GOPTaxPlan
The #GOPTaxPlan only allows deductions for federally declared natural disasters. But many disasters—including most wildfires—do not receive that designation.
Many victims of natural disasters would no longer be able to write off their losses under the Senate Republicans’ tax bill.
It’s beyond cruel to ask families struggling to pick up the pieces after a natural disaster to foot the bill for tax cuts for the rich! #GOPTaxPlan
Tax reform should prioritize middle-class Americans, not wealthy Republican donors. The Senate Republican bill fails that test! 

Under the Republican plan, more than 21 million middle-class households would see their taxes increase by 2025. #GOPTaxPlan
BREAKING: Senate Republicans now want to gut the Affordable Care Act in their tax bill! Middle-class families will pay more for health coverage while the top 1% get tax cuts. Terrible!
Another heartbreaking shooting, this time in Rancho Tehama, California. When will this stop and how can we stop it?

Learn more about our bill here: https://t.co/5LfmUBHNZM #BanAssaultWeapons
Our bill would ban bump-fire stocks and other accessories that increase a semi-automatic weapons rate of fire to that of a machine gun. #BanAssaultWeapons
Our bill would ban magazines and other ammunition feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, which allow shooters to quickly fire many rounds without needing to reload. #BanAssaultWeapons
Our bill would ban any assault weapon that accepts a detachable ammunition magazine and has one or more military characteristics: pistol grip, forward grip, barrel shroud, threaded barrel or folding or telescoping stock. #BanAssaultWeapons
Our bill to #BanAssaultWeapons would prohibit the sale, manufacture, transfer and importation of 205 military-style assault weapons by name.
The bottom line is that military-style assault weapons allow gunmen to kill more people, more quickly. These weapons should not be on our streets. #BanAssaultWeapons
November 2017: 26 parishioners praying in Sutherland Springs, Texas, were killed by a gunman with an assault rifle. The dead ranged from 17 months old to 77 years.
October 2017: A gunman opened fire on concertgoers in Las Vegas, turning an evening of music into a killing field. The shooter used multiple assault rifles fitted with bump-fire stocks to kill 58 people. This is the deadliest mass shooting in our history—so far.
June 2016: A gunman entered a nightclub in Orlando with an assault rifle, spraying revelers with gunfire. The shooter fired hundreds of rounds and killed 49 people. Many of the victims were shot in the head at close range.
December 2012: A young man entered an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., armed with an assault weapon. He murdered six educators and 20 first graders. One child was shot in the head after telling his classmates to run.
July 2012: A gunman walked into a darkened movie theater in Aurora, Colo., murdering 12 people and injuring 70. The youngest victim was 6 years old. The gunman had purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition in the months prior to the shooting.
If we’re going to change our nation's gun laws and get weapons of war off our streets, we need to keep talking about the carnage caused by assault weapons. We need to keep talking about the lives lost. #BanAssaultWeapons

The average California student graduates with $23,000 in debt. The Republican tax plan makes it MORE expensive to pay student loans back.
The #TrumpTax bill eliminates deductions for state and local income taxes. 5 million Californians could see their income taxed twice.

@thehill The ATF does NOT have the authority to address bump-fire stocks—and has made this point clear to Congress MULTIPLE times.

Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, Charleston, Roseburg, San Bernardino, Alexandria, Las Vegas. We can’t allow this to keep happening in our country.
Automatic weapons are illegal, but devices like bump stocks that modify a gun to fire at fully-automatic rates ARE legal. That makes no sense. We introduced a bill today to close that loophole.

After a mass shooting is EXACTLY the right time to talk about gun safety. If not now, when? To my Republican colleagues, I beg you—stand up to the NRA!
I’m looking at ways to proceed with legislation to ban bump fire stocks and close this ridiculous loophole for good. Doing nothing in the wake of this tragedy is not an option.
Automatic weapons are illegal, but individuals are still able to purchase bump stocks to allow semi-automatic weapons to fire up to 800 rounds per minute—the rate of automatic weapons—and inflict maximum carnage.
In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, Congress must examine ways to prevent tragedies like this from happening in the future.

64% of Medicaid funds in California cover those with disabilities and in nursing homes—the most vulnerable. We must not cut Medicaid!
Supporters of #GrahamCassidy say it will lower premiums. NOT TRUE! They will spike 20% under #GrahamCassidy.
Under #GrahamCassidy, states decide whether insurance companies cover your care. Cancer treatment, even asthma, may not be covered!
Over the next 20 years, #GrahamCassidy would cost California $800 BILLION. This would be absolutely crushing financially.
This provision of #GrahamCassidy says states can allow insurers to charge sick people much more for coverage. Terrible! https://t.co/zSeIj2Iecw
FACT: This provision of #GrahamCassidy says that states can allow insurers to spend less on care &amp; more on administration and CEO salaries. https://t.co/AGBilWILrw
Between 2020 and 2027, California would be forced to pay $129 billion more to offset the loss of federal funds from #GrahamCassidy.
California is the biggest loser if #GrahamCassidy passes. A 13% cut in federal funds amounts to a $129 billion loss by 2026!!
FACT: This provision of #GrahamCassidy says states can allow insurers to stop covering essential health care like maternity care. #SaveACA https://t.co/nD585k7MjB
Jimmy Kimmel has become a California hero for exposing the worst of the latest Republican “health care” bill. https://t.co/brzqTQOfur
Our state’s first-class children’s hospitals depend on Medicaid. Without Medicaid, they’ll need to reduce services and maybe even CLOSE!
Medicaid covers 1 in 3 Californians, including children, seniors in nursing homes and those with disabilities. We MUST protect it.
To vote without a Congressional Budget Office analysis of what #GrahamCassidy does to coverage &amp; premiums is irresponsible and inexcusable.
American people MUST be active. Get on the phones. Call Republican senators at 202-224-3121. #ProtectOurCare!!
You’d expect Senate Republicans’ 4th attempt at a “health care” bill to be better. Instead, #GrahamCassidy is the WORST!
#GrahamCassidy replaces the ACA’s federal guarantee of protections for pre-existing conditions with vague assurances. Don’t be fooled!
One of the #ACA's most important provisions said that insurance companies couldn’t sell junk plans. #GrahamCassidy brings them back.
Wishing everyone celebrating #RoshHashanah a very happy new year. Shanah Tovah!
Thank you Alyssa and Debra for helping to spread the word that California would be hit harder than ANY other state under #GrahamCassidy. https://t.co/le55yjrCkV
There's one constant in every Republican "health care" bill: Devastating cuts to Medicaid. It's indefensible. #ProtectOurCare

(1/3) The scenes from Mexico City are heartbreaking. I’ve lived through deadly earthquakes and my thoughts are with everyone affected.
#GrahamCassidy takes health funding from California and gives it to red states. California shouldn’t be punished. It's appalling! https://t.co/jpTcdPEQEL
Here’s a key point on #GrahamCassidy: It shifts a larger and larger portion of health care costs onto states, crushing them financially. https://t.co/lNw85cooKe
Previous CBO scores of their bills showed up to 32 million losing health care. The new Republican solution is to not wait for another score.
NEW: The CBO will not be able to analyze the effects of #GrahamCassidy on coverage and premiums by September 30. NO SCORE, NO VOTE!

It’s unbelievable to me that Senate Republicans would abandon bipartisan efforts to improve the Affordable Care Act for this awful bill!
I strongly support the efforts by Senators Murray and Alexander to craft bipartisan legislation to strengthen the individual market.
California would be forced to pay more than $57 BILLION more by 2027 to offset the loss of federal health care dollars. Crushing!

The Graham-Cassidy "health care" bill hits states that expanded Medicaid especially hard. That means California. We MUST defeat this bill!
A top priority between now and September 30 must be defeating the Graham-Cassidy bill. #SaveACA
The latest ‘health care’ bill—Graham-Cassidy—is much like the four that came before it: 32 million would lose coverage.
Here’s what you need to know about the Graham-Cassidy bill: It would disproportionately hurt California and take away billions.
Republicans have until September 30th to pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We can’t lose focus. #SaveACA
ATTENTION: Senate Republicans may try to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid AGAIN. Time to make calls!

My full statement on new Trump-backed immigration bill: https://t.co/gweA4Wc6c7
What does it say about this administration’s values that wealthy individuals are allowed in while people fleeing violence are turned away?
Our country shouldn’t tell immigrants who perform thankless jobs that they can work but can’t build lives here. That’s not what we're about.
My mother emigrated from Russia. She couldn’t speak English and had no education. Under the new Trump-backed bill, she'd be turned away.
You shouldn’t have to jeopardize your financial security to care for a new baby or loved one. That’s why I support the FAMILY Act. #FMLA24

Unlike the health care debate, Republicans MUST return to regular order with tax reform. Hearings and broad stakeholder input is vital.
True tax reform DOES NOT mean simply handing out tax cuts to the nation’s richest.
Senate Democrats will oppose any attempt to use tax reform as a disguise for giving tax cuts to the rich.
The bottom line for any tax reform bill: The stability of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is nonnegotiable.
Cadiz Inc. won’t give up on their plan to rob the Mojave Desert of its groundwater. This bad plan MUST be stopped.
Assemblymember Friedman’s bill would require projects like Cadiz to leave groundwater resources unharmed. California must pass it.

If you make $1 above the limit—$47,521 per year—you lose all financial help and premiums may be unaffordable. Let’s fix that.
We need to improve affordability in the insurance market. One way to do that is to eliminate the sharp cut off for tax-credit subsidies.

Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we get back to work to improve the Affordable Care Act for all Americans.
This will be one of the easiest votes I've cast. Proud to vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act. California, I stand with you.
The CBO confirms what we already knew: This bill is a KILLER. #SkinnyRepeal https://t.co/aJFnzwCryn
NEW: These 8 pages would cause 16 million to lose coverage, increase premiums by 20% and defund Planned Parenthood. https://t.co/SRviIolXoG
UPDATE: It’s 10 p.m. and we haven’t seen the bill we’re supposed to vote on TONIGHT.
The reason to vote “YES” is to get a bill signed into law. The reason to vote “NO” is to kill it. Simple!
Health care is a matter of life and death. For Senate Republicans to proceed so cavalierly betrays our obligation to the American people.
If you’re not willing to see a bill get signed into law, DON’T VOTE FOR IT! #SkinnyRepeal
Republicans claim they want to lower premiums. Their latest plan INCREASES premiums by 20 percent more than projected. #SkinnyRepeal
24 million, 22 million, 32 million, 16 million—that’s how many Americans lose coverage under the first four Republican health care bills.
Why would a conference committee produce a good health care bill when every bill produced so far has been an unmitigated disaster? Vote NO!
Senate Republicans are now saying they will vote for a bill ONLY if House Republicans promise NOT to vote for it. Absurd!
Senate 101: Only vote for legislation that you want to get signed into law. DON'T vote for legislation that you think is terrible.
.@CoveredCA: Many would drop coverage NOT because there is no penalty but because premiums could be 20 percent HIGHER. https://t.co/kxj0i9xxwF
.@CoveredCA: Republican bill would “take California backward in terms of coverage gains achieved over the last four years.” #SaveACA
.@CoveredCA on so-called "skinny" repeal: 700,000 lose coverage, individual market far less stable.
A witness at today’s Judiciary hearing suggests Russia may have offered information in exchange for Trump team cooperation. WATCH: https://t.co/0HSJ9d0DlE
A bipartisan group of 10 governors are urging Senate Republicans to abandon “skinny repeal” and work with Democrats to #SaveACA.
There’s only one reason to try to ram through a secret bill with no CBO score in the middle of the night: Because the bill is terrible.
Bills and their Congressional Budget Office analysis are supposed to be available for 28 HOURS before a vote. IMPOSSIBLE if we vote tonight.
UPDATE: Reports indicate that we may vote TONIGHT on a bill that would cause 16 million to lose their insurance. No one has seen this bill!
New @YouTube initiative fights back against ISIS online. Great move—terrorist propaganda should NOT be easy to find. https://t.co/NEsRnJXwQB

BREAKING: The Congressional Budget Office says the Republican's so-called "skinny" repeal would increase premiums by 20% NEXT YEAR. #SaveACA

@UCSFChildrens We have an obligation to protect health care for those with disabilities. They deserve the opportunity to lead their best lives. #SaveACA
@UCSFChildrens When I asked Nina how she and Drew cope, she told me that you simply live the life you have. That’s great advice for us all.
@UCSFChildrens Nina’s son Drew has cerebral palsy. Medicaid ensures he can live at home by providing in-home nursing care.
A few weeks ago at @UCSFChildrens in San Francisco I met with three mothers—Kristin, Sally and Nina. https://t.co/jQOGkxTZrG
Medicaid helps individuals with disabilities lead full lives. Protecting it is about defending the rights of all disabled people.
SOON: Democrats will offer an amendment to protect those with disabilities and send the bill to committee so we can have an OPEN process.
It's the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guaranteed those with disabilities a place in society. #ADA27
Medicaid is the primary payer of nursing home care—why are Republicans intent on gutting it? https://t.co/XeKSngTZmF #KillTheBill
We know what would result—a bill that takes coverage from millions, guts Medicaid and undermines protections for pre-existing conditions.
Senate Republicans just want to pass SOMETHING because it would allow them to enter into secret negotiations with House Republicans.
Downright cruel to tell 15,000 transgender individuals currently serving that they are no longer wanted. I’ll do all I can to fight this.

Republicans claim they want to reduce premiums, but the so-called “skinny” repeal would increase average premiums by 25% NEXT YEAR. #SaveACA
If we scrap the requirement that those who can afford insurance get covered, only sick people get covered and everyone’s premiums SKYROCKET.
NEW: Republicans are pushing a plan that would destroy the individual insurance market nationwide. This is another easy NO vote!
Democrats will offer an amendment to protect Medicaid and send the bill to committee so we can proceed with an OPEN, bipartisan process.
This approach would cause 32 MILLION Americans to lose coverage. Premiums next year would increase by 25% MORE than projected!
NEXT: We vote on the 2nd Republican amendment in an hour. It repeals the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. An easy NO vote.
It’s good news that this amendment was soundly defeated. It shows there is little support for the bill Republicans have pushed for months.
Under this plan, 22 million Americans would lose coverage and Medicaid would be cut by 35%, devastating care for children and the elderly.
Let’s recap: The 1st Republican amendment, which slashes Medicaid, increases premiums and brings back junk plans was DEFEATED 43-57.
SOON: We're voting on 1st Republican amendment that guts Medicaid, slashes tax credits to buy insurance &amp; allows junk plans. Easy NO vote!
The process on health care in the coming days will be confusing. That’s by design. Republicans don’t want you to know what they’re doing!
To my colleagues who are undecided, make no mistake, the final vote on health care will be among the most important you will ever take.
Senate Republicans are moving forward on repealing the Affordable Care Act with no idea what's next. It's the height of irresponsibility.
This is a gut-check moment. Senators need to decide whether taking health coverage away from millions is what they were sent here to do.
I’m appalled you keep going after Hillary. She can’t be the reason for your every vendetta. You’re the president—start acting like it! https://t.co/1MM3AS48KQ
We may have lost this battle, but the war continues! We must defeat the dangerous Republican effort to devastate health care!
Medicaid covers 74 million Americans. It’s unconscionable to cut it by 35% without ONE hearing to consider the effects. #SaveMedicaid
We're voting to advance a health care bill in ONE HOUR, but no one has any idea which bill. This is an assault on our democracy. #SaveACA
Gutting Medicaid is a non-starter. Ending Medicaid as we know it would jeopardize care for children, the elderly &amp; those with disabilities.
I would have thought providing health care for children was nonnegotiable. Republicans don’t seem to think so. Shameful. #Trumpcare
Mothers like Jennifer are speaking out: Please Republicans—don’t endanger our children’s health care. @ChildrensLA https://t.co/j6pfmK6ZFw

Care for children with the most serious health care needs will be put at risk if we slash Medicaid. The Republican bill must be defeated.
I don’t understand how anyone could vote to advance a bill that takes health care away from millions without hearing from those affected.
At @UCSFChildrens, I met families with employer-sponsored health coverage who rely on Medicaid to fill in gaps. It’s vital for so many.
Each version of the Republican health care bill goes beyond repealing Affordable Care Act—ending Medicaid as we know it.
FACT: Republican health bill would increase premiums for older Americans. Junk plans that don’t cover needed care are NOT “freedom.”
Make no mistake, a 'yes' vote on health care is an endorsement of the most indefensible process on a major bill I’ve seen in 24 years.
Gutting Medicaid threatens children’s hospitals nationwide—endangering the lives of our most vulnerable children. Terrible!
The @NYTimes shows that ALL Republican health care bills are dangerous. They must be defeated! https://t.co/nS64CITVAn
Our job is to protect children. I’ll do all I can to defeat a bill that jeopardizes health care for 36 million children covered by Medicaid.

Republicans don't have the votes on their health care bill. That’s good news—but it doesn't mean they won't try again. We can't let up!
Republican health care bill has no employer mandate for offering coverage—Americans working full time could still be unable to afford care!
The more I learn about the Republican health care bill, the more I dislike it—4 million would lose employer-based health coverage next year!
Beth from Davis: My son has Down syndrome. Thanks to Medicaid he's received support and will graduate from high school. #AmericaSpeaksOut
5 million children in California covered by Medicaid. Republican health care bill says it’s more important to cut taxes for billionaires.
Republican health care bill is a lose-lose for California. I’ll do everything in my power to defeat it.

The Republican Senate bill is even worse than the Republican House bill, with DEEPER cuts to Medicaid.
Republican health care bill would end the federal-state Medicaid partnership—leaving states like ours on the hook for billions in costs.

Republican health care bill would cut billions in taxes for the richest Americans while taking health coverage from the vulnerable.

Medicaid covers more than 1 MILLION elderly people in California—many in nursing homes. The Senate bill SLASHES Medicaid.
Today, Medicaid covers more than 5 million children in California. The GOP Senate #HealthcareBill GUTS this program.
Under the Senate #HealthcareBill, insurance companies could sell junk plans that don't cover things like maternity care. Terrible!
Nearly 750,000 Californians got health care at Planned Parenthood last year. GOP bill DEFUNDS this critical provider. #IStandWithPP
Medicaid covers 14 million Californians today. The Republican Senate bill ENDS Medicaid as we know it.
How can anyone support taking health care from disable children to cut taxes for billionaires? Indefensible!
Under the Senate #HealthcareBill, insurance companies could charge sick people much more than healthy people. Terrible!
Draconian Medicaid cuts mean California would be on the hook for billions more in health care costs. #HealthcareBill
It's unforgivable to take health care from the vulnerable and working people to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires. #HealthcareBill
GOP Senate #HealthcareBill goes BEYOND repealing the Affordable Care Act. It ends Medicaid as we've known it since 1965.
It's clear now why Senate Republicans kept the #HealthcareBill secret. It does NOTHING to improve health care in America!
Senate #HealthcareBill is Robin Hood in reverse. It takes health care from the poor to cut taxes for the rich! #Trumpcare

Process on Senate Republican bill: Secret bill, no hearings. Process on ACA: 100 hearings and meetings, 25 days of debate. #ShowUsTheBill
I want to improve the Affordable Care Act. That's why I wrote a bill to expand help to more families. https://t.co/LooBh4VJoK #HoldTheFloor
It's flat out WRONG to say that the ACA is "dead." California has worked hard to implement the law and it's working well. #HoldTheFloor
Monica from Oceanside wrote to me: My doctor said that I would be dead if it weren't for the Affordable Care Act. #AmericaSpeaksOut
If our Republican colleagues continue down this path, we'll fight this bill with all we have. The stakes are too high not to. #HoldTheFloor
Republicans have proposed ending Medicaid as we know it. The program covers 14 million Californians. It's indefensible! #AmericaSpeaksOut
We’re taking to the Senate floor to demand Republicans end secrecy surrounding their health bill. #AmericaSpeaksOut https://t.co/ndT4bDQaaL

Health experts and advocates have been shut out. Unconscionable to ignore groups like the American Heart Association! @American_Heart
When Republican senators are asked what’s in the bill they often have no idea. That’s because they don’t even have a bill to read!
This is the LEAST transparent process for a major bill I’ve seen in my Senate career. Everything behind closed doors. #Trumpcare

(2/3) Why would Trump clear Oval Office of everyone, including Comey’s boss AG Sessions? Maybe he wanted to say something with no witnesses.
(1/3) According to Comey, Trump said he hoped Comey would agree “to letting Flynn go.” Trump says it didn’t happen. I believe Comey.
