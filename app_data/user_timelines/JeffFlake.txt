So sorry to learn of the passing  of former Rep. Ed Pastor. I had the privilege of serving with Ed for more than a decade. There was no one more capable, hardworking and kind. Arizona is a far better place because of Ed Pastor.
Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to finish his investigation. Tomorrow, Sen. @ChrisCoons and I will again call for unanimous consent to bring S. 2644, which will protect the Special Counsel, to the Senate floor for a vote. https://t.co/HgPMo6Iu6X

I have informed the Majority Leader that I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting action on the floor, until the Mueller protection bill is brought to the full Senate for a vote.

Congratulations to @kyrstensinema on a race well run, and won. It’s been a wonderful honor representing Arizona in the Senate. You’ll be great.
There is no evidence of election officials "cooking the books" in Arizona. Such careless language undermines confidence in our democratic institutions. https://t.co/cNjYp0yIa1
There is no evidence of "electoral corruption" in Arizona, Mr. President. Thousands of dedicated Arizonans work in a non-partisan fashion every election cycle to ensure that every vote is counted. We appreciate their service. https://t.co/Xtd5Vd0gSu
When the Senate convenes next week, @ChrisCoons and I will ask for unanimous consent to bring S.2644, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, to a vote on the Senate floor. After the firing of The AG, it is more important than ever to protect the Special Counsel.
Jeff Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself nearly two years ago. He has paid a heavy price for his independence ever since. We owe him a debt of gratitude.
Earlier this year, we passed S.2644, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill would safeguard Robert Mueller’s investigation. Leader McConnell should bring the bill to the Senate floor as soon as possible

Mr. President, as today’s indictments reaffirm, election interference is not a question to be asked of Vladimir Putin, but a statement to be made to Vladimir Putin: You interfered in our elections.
My thoughts on the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin https://t.co/UZD8HCundr
At approximate 2:00pm EDT I will deliver a senate floor speech titled Friends, Foes &amp; Peace
When we were attacked on 9/11, our NATO allies rushed to our defense. They have remained stedfast ever since, sacrificing thousands of lives in Afghanistan over these many years to keep us safe. I hope they know how much we appreciate their commitment and friendship.
By a vote of 88-11, the senate just took the first step to rein in the President’s abuse of trade authority by using national security as justification to levy tariffs.
FINALLY, Senate will push back on the President’s abuse of Section 232 to impose tariffs. We will vote Wednesday on a “Motion to Instruct,” a first step toward reasserting Congress’s constitutional role on tariffs.

I can’t promise one of my colleagues won’t block an up-or-down vote on a #DACA extension, but I can promise that I’ll be back on the floor, again and again, motioning for a vote until we pass a bill providing relief for those struggling due to our inaction https://t.co/JhIPWhO73X
This is serious, despite prior WH claims to the contrary. It’s time we treat it as such https://t.co/qZpT9MOMQv
Lots of questions about next steps on DACA. For me, it'll be frequent trips to the Senate floor to try to force a vote on a #3for3 compromise to give DACA recipients a 3-year extension &amp; the Admin 3 years of full funding ($7.6 billion) for its #BorderSecurity plan
Last night, the Senate passed a bill I intro'd w/ @SenJohnMcCain &amp; @SenatorTester to give Veterans Treatment Courts more resources to treat veterans struggling w/ PTSD, substance abuse &amp; other issues. Working to get it thru the House &amp; signed into law soon https://t.co/wQ2Y7wyNg0
Disappointed the Senate has been unable to pass a permanent #DACA fix &amp; do more to secure the border, but failure is not an option. I’ve filed a temporary fix extending #DACA for 3 yrs &amp; providing $7.6 billion for #BorderSecurity. Let’s give it a vote asap https://t.co/4zezFKiD2N
Any #DACA fix will need broad, bipartisan support to get the 60 votes necessary to pass the Senate. The proposal produced by the Common-Sense Coalition currently has 19 cosponsors and counting, and it offers the best chance of success. https://t.co/uRIEBp2dRB

I'm voting against this $300 billion spending hike. Fiscal responsibility is more than a talking point to trot out when the other guys are in charge. Let’s be conservative no matter who’s in charge, no matter who’s in the White House, or who controls each chamber of Congress https://t.co/zYEDgMX5Ap

We represent less than 5% of the world's population and just 20% of the world's economic output. To find markets for our goods &amp; services, we need to sign new trade agreements. We can't afford to be left behind by shunning these agreements.
Canada and 10 other countries agree to new TPP trade deal. We're being left behind. https://t.co/g0diraogAX
Earmarks didn't make Congress more efficient and collegial; they made it more wasteful and corrupt. It's time to end the conversation about bringing them back and pass our bipartisan bill to permanently #BanEarmarks https://t.co/wZa1n166CJ

Just got off the phone with @SenJohnMcCain. He is sounding good and is pleased that the senate has voted to reopen the federal government.
Now that agreement has been reached to keep govt open, the real work begins. Now CR will expire on Feb 8. Need to get broader agreement on DACA legislation and prepare for floor debate.
I’m confident that with the senate vote at noon today we can reopen the govt and lay the groundwork for a DACA solution

Our senate group drafting a bipartisan DACA bill is making good progress. Yesterday's WH meeting was helpful in setting parameters.

From the Associated Press: Following months of investigation and four FBI trips to Havana, an interim report from the bureau's Operational Technology Division says the probe has uncovered no evidence that sound waves could have damaged the Americans' health.
There's a #DACA deal to be had but it’s going to require compromise. The @WhiteHouse won’t get everything they want, @TheDemocrats won’t, &amp; neither will the @GOP.

Congress must act immediately to pass permanent, stand-alone legislation to lawfully ensure that children who were brought here... 4/5

Trade deficits are often confused with budget deficits. Here's context from Wash Post on our trade deficit with Mexico. We still benefit https://t.co/zd9m44gKBU
NAFTA is good for Mexico. Pew Research found that since 2009 more Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico than have migrated to the U.S.
Since NAFTA was adopted, U.S. exports to Mexico have gone from $68 billion in 1994 to $235 billion in 2016. Trade is good for all of us.
Free trade is not a zero sum game where someone wins and someone loses. NAFTA benefits both the U.S. &amp; Mexico. https://t.co/I7O72DMqeo

We're all frustrated that IR hasn't moved in the House, but POTUS dismissing genuine concern about unilateral executive action doesn't help.
@ananavarro  Yes, communists don't like good music, or much else subversive for that matter. How, again, does that justify OUR travel ban?
@ananavarro Why shield the Castro regime from American influence?  Not every American goes to Cuba to get a tan.
@ananavarro No, they haven't released Alan Gross. So why coddle them by keeping the travel ban in place? It's time to get tough.
#POTUS sends right msg to C. America: “Do not send your children to the borders...they'll get sent back." @StateDept needs to broadcast it.

Lost amid the noise of the deal: the BCA/sequester remains intact, preserving significant and hard-fought spending cuts.

Intro’d bill today to combat dangerous IRS practice of targeting tax-exempt orgs based on ideology: http://t.co/btHBjqzXSh
Wow. First the IRS targets conservative groups. Now the DoJ targets the AP. What's next? HUD targeting homeowners?
POTUS has strong words for IRS on its targeting of conservative groups. Fine, but now let's see some follow through.  What's next?
So, if "low level" staffers at the IRS can target #teaparty and #patriot, what's next? Party registration? Donation history?
Border security amendments from Sens Grassley and Cornyn adopted in markup will improve #immigrationreform bill.
