70% of North Dakota soybeans are typically exported to Asia, primarily China. But China is moving to cut U.S. soybeans out of their market entirely, putting North Dakota’s crop – valued at $2.1 billion last year – in peril. https://t.co/5ZrHcSBdd4
Total U.S. soybean exports to China are down 97% this marketing year. These numbers are startling and unprecedented.
There were ZERO U.S. soybean exports to China last week, typically one of the strongest export weeks of the year. The administration’s #tradewar is an unfolding disaster for North Dakota soybean farmers. https://t.co/N4dW4CvIbL

@business I’ve been fighting for ND’s wind energy industry &amp; workers for years, &amp; I’m taking action to promote smart trade policies that protect wind, oil &amp; gas, ag, &amp; manufacturing industries threatened by the administration’s #tradewar. https://t.co/HemfoL5mjQ
According to a recent @business report, the tariffs on steel, aluminum, and parts like blades, gearboxes, &amp; crank shafts will slow development &amp; ultimately lead to higher energy costs for consumers. https://t.co/QdXo5sQ7uD

@ruralhealth Read more from @ruralhealth about how my #RuralMOMSAct would help provide resources &amp; training to combat the growing maternal mortality crisis in rural America &amp; Indian Country. https://t.co/MwpCGMxpRU
.@ruralhealth’s Diane Calmus: “Senator Heitkamp’s #RuralMOMSAct will help rural communities struggling w/ rising maternal mortality rates &amp; disappearing care by improving data, addressing workforce shortages, &amp; supporting increased services.” https://t.co/dYiJu4dSFU
The #RuralMOMSAct builds on my bipartisan bill to boost our research efforts to understand why we’re seeing rising maternal deaths in a nation as advanced as the United States so we can build stronger, safer, &amp; healthier rural &amp; tribal communities.
In September I met w/ mothers in Grand Forks who experienced complications during their pregnancies, during childbirth or during post-partum periods—their stories were harrowing &amp; no mother should experience the physical &amp; emotional distress of preventable pregnancy complications https://t.co/oTrVZxrm73
Sadly, more women in the United States die from pregnancy-related complications than in most other developed nations &amp; the @CDC reports that pregnancy-related deaths in the US increased by 250% from 1987-2014. #RuralMOMSAct
To help combat the growing maternal mortality crisis in rural America &amp; Indian Country I intro’d the #RuralMOMSAct to prioritize collecting rural maternal health data, expand info-sharing between rural obstetricians &amp; increase access to training for nurses, midwives &amp; physicians. https://t.co/yRzjqiiI8s

However, this agreement also doesn’t address the steel &amp; aluminum tariffs which are still putting North Dakota’s energy industry &amp; agriculture manufacturing equipment companies in jeopardy.
From the beginning of the renegotiation of #NAFTA—which has been going on for over a year—I’ve been pushing for a deal that maintains ND’s critical trade relationships w/ Canada &amp; Mexico &amp; addresses several issues important to North Dakota agriculture
The administration’s new #trade agreement w/ Canada &amp; Mexico is good news for wheat growers who would no longer face an unfair Canadian grading system—a change I’ve been pushing for—but it’s disappointing the concerns of cattle ranchers &amp; potato farmers were not addressed. https://t.co/1DIW3m0mvr
It’s great news for ND to finally see the issue resolved in a way that will make brick—&amp;—mortar biz more competitive &amp; boost state revenue, adding needed resources that can support investments in education, infrastructure &amp; other state projects— which benefits every community.
ND estimates that it could collect $50 million in additional revenue annually. In 2015 alone, the total uncollected sales &amp; use taxes in the US was nearly $26 billion. Retailers w/o a physical presence have a price advantage over brick-&amp;-mortar businesses of up to 8.5% in ND.
As ND’s Tax Commissioner in 1992, I brought #NDvQuill to #SCOTUS in an effort to require catalog retailers to collect state sales &amp; use taxes—the Court didn’t decide favorably then, but I pushed to take up a new case to resolve the issue—&amp; it did w/ its #SDvWayfair ruling in June https://t.co/tUiOJAPzZw
Today, ND will begin collecting sales &amp; use tax from online &amp; out-of-state vendors, a huge victory for the state &amp; #smallbiz that have been at a competitive disadvantage—the result of my decades-long effort to level the playing field for brick-&amp;-mortar biz in North Dakota. https://t.co/l0qUTePjg4
I’ll continue to work toward passing a final #FarmBill as soon as possible, and House Republicans should join the Senate to put politics aside and get back to work on behalf of farm country.
The US Senate passed a strong #FarmBill w/ historic support from Rs &amp; Ds—we need House Republicans to commit to coming to the table to compromise so Congress can do its job to support farmers &amp; ranchers.
Disappointing that at a time of turmoil in farm country due to the administration's #tradewar, the US House of Representatives took a break in August &amp; much of September— and has now adjourned until mid-November.
The current #FarmBill expires at midnight tonight. Americans expect members of Congress to get to work and do their jobs, but passing a strong Farm Bill is clearly not the priority it should be for House Republicans who want to keep pushing partisan provisions.

@gfherald @axios @AmyAHarder This @washingtonpost story from 2016 highlights how my #FUTUREAct—which became law earlier this year—is an example of how we can find common ground on the divisive issue of carbon if we work across the aisle—just as I try to do every day in the Senate.
https://t.co/06Br4N2gMS
@gfherald @axios @AmyAHarder This February, my bipartisan #FUTUREAct became law which creates a path forward for coal jobs in ND while reducing emissions. Read more on @Medium abt how this win builds on my decades-long fight for ND energy. https://t.co/XJhIfhWpms
@EPA Because of my efforts to support biofuels in North Dakota, I was recently honored to receive the Fueling Growth Award from @GrowthEnergy https://t.co/Mj8IFb1OvN
@gfherald @axios @AmyAHarder Encouraging investment &amp; innovation is key for the future of ND's energy industry, that's why I worked hard to pass my #FUTUREAct, rallying support from both sides of the aisle. It became law earlier this year. Read more in the @bistrib:

@EPA Biofuel producers and farmers need certainty from year to year – which is why I’ve fought for consistent policies that keep renewable fuels competitive. https://t.co/A7D78WwtzO
@gfherald @axios @AmyAHarder .@IEA analysis on my bipartisan #FUTUREAct, now signed into law, shows it will have a key role in expanding development &amp; deployment of carbon capture utilization and storage tech, paving a viable path fwd for ND coal while reducing emissions https://t.co/nj8FH920F8
@EPA The @EPA went down a damaging path by issuing waivers to big oil refiners that threatened biofuel production. The inappropriate use of these waivers hurt ND farmers and biofuel producers, so I fought back. https://t.co/WocD6WecTf
I’ve also been fighting for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard. Urged Acting @EPA Director Wheeler to fulfill the administration’s commitment to a strong RFS &amp; invited him to visit ND to see the impact of EPA policies on farmers, ranchers &amp; energy producers. https://t.co/NxYk6aU7fN
WATCH: Last year w/ @SenWhitehouse @SenCapito &amp; @SenJohnBarrasso I reintroduced the #FUTUREAct to extend 45Q tax credit to promote carbon capture while reducing emissions. It was signed into law this February, in a major victory for an all-of-the-above energy strategy. https://t.co/NO1ghAJ4cJ

Women face poverty in retirement at rates drastically higher than men. No one should have to worry about losing retirement savings or falling into poverty in their golden years—our bill would help more ND women enjoy the long-term retirement security they’ve earned.
In 2014, median retirement income for women was just 55% of the avg male retirement income. Also, women 65+ are 80% more likely to fall into poverty during retirement &amp; are more likely to leave the workforce during their income-earning years to become caregivers for loved ones.
Too often, women face challenges in the workplace w/ gender pay disparities &amp; lack of access to paid leave to care for family members or newborns. Proud to help intro a bill to extend critical protections for women’s retirement security to help women better prepare for retirement https://t.co/oZGwUIwt2I

@EIAgov @gfherald I worked for a year &amp; a half to negotiate a bipartisan deal to lift the ban on exporting in oil in 2015. I’m proud of this achievement on behalf of ND’s energy industry &amp; hard-working Americans. Now we’re seeing the results for ND. Here’s how it happened:
https://t.co/5g8i2A7L0W
@EIAgov @gfherald This @nytimes article chronicles my long, persistent efforts w/ @lisamurkowski to lift the 40 yr old ban on crude oil exports, which we succeeded in doing in 2015. Read more:
https://t.co/984gpnkuIs
@EIAgov Earlier this year, US oil exports reached record levels—I’m looking back at why it’s happening: 3 yrs ago Congress lifted the ban on exporting oil, which I worked on for 1.5 yrs to build support, reach a deal &amp; get votes to pass it. Read more in @gfherald https://t.co/yg40WK1leZ
.@EIAgov reports that crude oil was the largest US petroleum export in the 1st half of 2018—in large part b/c of my work to successfully negotiate a bipartisan deal in 2015 to lift the ban on exporting oil. Follow along today to see what made it possible. https://t.co/M1UBHR8tJd
I’ll keep pushing for solutions &amp; action to end to this trade war and for smart trade policies that hold China accountable while also protecting markets for North Dakota goods.
North Dakota commodities affected by this round of retaliatory tariffs from China include:
🐄 Beef—ND ranchers held nearly 1 million beef cattle at the start of 2018
🌾 Wheat—$2.76 billion in 2017
🌱 Dry Edible Beans—$301 million in 2017
🌿 Peas &amp; Lentils—$151.3 million in 2017
The trade war is already hurting farmers &amp; ranchers by causing commodity prices to fall &amp; orders to be cancelled. Not a single order for North Dakota soybeans has been placed by China, which was the biggest customer of the our state’s crop—a value of $2.13 billion in 2017.
After the administration escalated its #tradewar w/ China today, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that are vital to ND’s agriculture economy—at the worst possible time for ND farmers. https://t.co/C9D9vxQTPV
Last week I helped pass a bipartisan funding bill that includes funds to connect expectant mothers in rural areas to facilities w/ OB care &amp; met w/ health care advocates in Grand Forks to examine rising U.S. maternal mortality rates. Read more in @GFHerald https://t.co/KsZu0pZmPV
The administration’s damaging #tradewar could have a far-reaching impact on the US economy. @NBCnews reports that we could see a hit of as much as $62 billion to the US GDP, &amp; up to 715,000 auto industry jobs lost as a result. Read more: https://t.co/LijBOX2LVP
ND farmers &amp; ranchers succeed when the fed. gov’t works to open export markets for their products &amp; invests in relationships w/ our trade partners. Instead, @AgweekMagazine shows how the administration’s #tradewar is cutting off access to those markets, hurting our ag producers. https://t.co/hHEz4Hibmh

@NPR .@SenCapito &amp; I shared w/ @WhatToExpect author @HeidiMurkoff how our bipartisan bill would strengthen resources to help address rising maternal mortality rates in the U.S.—read our full interview here:
https://t.co/dGRGewrlDV
@NPR Access to high-quality, affordable health care is still a challenge in rural communities across ND &amp; the country. This important @nytimes article highlights the need to support rural health care so mothers can have safe &amp; health pregnancies
https://t.co/ZhCl4S0jTq
@NPR The US is the only industrialized country in the world w/ rising maternal mortality rates which grew 250% in 1987-2014. Read more in @ProPublica abt my bipartisan bill w/ @SenCapito to strengthen resources to address this growing crisis
https://t.co/FLacEmKAJX
This heartbreaking story series from @NPR shares the full picture of the growing maternal mortality rate health crisis &amp; how urgent it is for Congress to take action by passing my bipartisan bill to address maternal health. https://t.co/T10izQ7uhf
The crisis of rising maternal mortality rates in the US urgently needs more resources to understand how to address it effectively. This story in @USATODAY outlines how much work there is to do across the US to make sure mothers get the support they need
https://t.co/JOMD6mXiWl
I’ll keep working to get our bill across the finish line, so we can prevent these heartbreaking tragedies &amp; protect the next generation of mothers &amp; infants. Follow the thread for resources to learn more about this crisis &amp; why Congress must act 👇
Earlier this week, I also helped pass a bipartisan funding bill that includes wins I secured: $50m in funding for a new initiative aimed at reducing maternal mortality. The bill also includes $12 million for expanded data collection at State Maternal Mortality review boards.
My bipartisan bill would help facilitate stronger, safer, &amp; healthier pregnancies by investing in cutting-edge research, beefing up information sharing, &amp; giving physicians &amp; providers the tools they need to improve the patient experience.
According to @CDCgov, pregnancy-related deaths in the US rose by 250% from 1987-2014. We need to figure out what’s going on, &amp; that requires collecting data to identify the factors that are causing young mothers to experience life-threatening health issues.
Today in Grand Forks I brought together health care providers, families &amp; maternal health advocates to examine the causes of rising maternal mortality rates in the US &amp; to discuss ideas—like my new bill to better support the health &amp; well-being of mothers &amp; newborn children in ND https://t.co/HVprgIjnva
Important @nytimes article about how the administration’s #tradewar could create a “new economic Cold War” between China and the US. ND farmers need smart trade policies that support them and enable them to export, not trade wars. https://t.co/e634Yp4cYI
@KXMB Read more on @Medium about how my #Relief4MainStreet bill strengthens many important consumer protections for seniors, veterans, servicemembers, &amp; those vulnerable to or victims of identity theft.
https://t.co/4LNTMsd8mu
@KXMB Good credit is essential to everything from getting a small business loan, a home mortgage, or simply applying for a new credit card—&amp; consumers have enough challenges without having to worry about criminals impacting their credit scores.
@KXMB If you’re a parent, you can also request free credit freezes &amp; free credit monitoring for your children’s credit scores to protect them from identity theft. Learn more on the @FTC’s child identity fraud resource guide: https://t.co/pTxlOdoWIM
@KXMB According to the @WSJ, nearly 250,000 North Dakota residents may have been affected by the @Equifax data breach a year ago. It’s important to take immediate steps, like freezing your credit file for free, to protect yourself against identity theft.
https://t.co/h4P6xMTdIr
@KXMB Freezing credit prevents activity that could impact your credit score, like fraudulent loans taken out by someone who has stolen your identity. To request free credit freezes, follow the steps here: https://t.co/jothGjoLIj

@USDA @SecretarySonny I also urged @SecretarySonny  to continue working w/ Congress to get a #FarmBill done as quickly as possible to give certainty to our ag producers that important safety net programs will remain in place.
@USDA @SecretarySonny In frequent phone calls and meetings w/ @SecretarySonny, I always emphasize the importance of trade to North Dakota’s ag economy. ND farmers want markets, but as long as the administration continues its #tradewar we have to do everything we can to mitigate the impact.
Earlier this month I urged @USDA @SecretarySonny to improve the aid package to farmers suffering from slumping commodity prices &amp; an uncertain future for this season’s crop. On a call today, I continued to push him to make our farmers whole as the cost of the #tradewar mounts https://t.co/yrBamh5HbZ
Soybeans are an important part of ND’s ag economy, but the administration’s #tradewar is pushing China to lower its reliance on soybeans &amp; to buy from other countries—potentially removing the biggest buyer of US soybeans from the market. Read more @reuters https://t.co/W3fxa0CTYf
It’s also critical that we continue to increase the protections for Native women &amp; look at expanding tribal authority where appropriate so that abusers can no longer escape punishment in Indian Country. #MMIW #NotInvisible
For too long, crimes of domestic violence hid in the shadows. But there is still much work to do. Now, Congress must quickly pass a long-term extension of #VAWA to give victims of abuse the resources they need to seek justice &amp; recover from the trauma they’ve endured.
The Senate also passed a short-term extension of the Violence Against Women Act (#VAWA). Its reauthorization was the 1st bill I cosponsored &amp; helped pass in 2013. Since serving as ND’s Attorney General I've kept fighting to end domestic violence &amp; protect victims of these crimes. https://t.co/9WS4fKSrgD
It also includes an amendment I’m proud to have successfully incorporated that makes sure North Dakota doctors, nurses, &amp; other health care professionals have the proper training to identify &amp; get help for victims of sex trafficking—which builds off my #SOARAct
I fought to include a pay raise for our troops and for vital funding to support important ND national security missions like modernizing @TeamMinot’s B-52s, upgrading our nuclear arsenal, &amp; supporting #UAS development so our servicemembers are supported
Today w/ a bipartisan majority, I helped pass a funding bill that supports our military, access to rural health care, &amp; a good education for our children—&amp; I fought to include several provisions to keep ND communities strong &amp; safe. https://t.co/uQwJQYWh1Y

@CDCgov To help address the mental health crisis in ND, last week I hosted my #SummitToStopSuicide in West Fargo to bring together leaders from across ND for a comprehensive discussion about preventing suicide. Read more about the Summit in @inforum: https://t.co/4M6b8kXeBK
@CDCgov The severe and traumatic stress too many Native children face has long-term repercussions, including higher rates of suicide, &amp; we need to do everything we can to make sure every child in our country is safe. Our bipartisan bill is part of that solution.
@CDCgov Too often, local &amp; statewide suicide prevention programs do not fully meet the needs of Indian Country, particularly when it comes to addressing the mental health challenges caused by poverty, abuse, addiction, or lack of educational or employment opportunities on reservations.
From @CDCgov, the suicide rate of American Indians &amp; Alaska Natives was over 3.5x higher than other ethnic groups. To help address this crisis in ND &amp; across the country I helped intro a bipartisan bill to require states to work w/ tribal communities on new prevention strategies. https://t.co/Fik5wL5uqn

I’m fighting in the US Senate to bring more resources to the front lines while looking for innovative ways to address the long-term consequences of this epidemic &amp; providing wraparound comprehensive services to those suffering from addiction—to keep ND communities strong &amp; safe
Over the past few years, drug abuse &amp; drug-related deaths have steeply risen across rural America. In North Dakota, drug-related deaths increased by nearly 400% from 2013-2016—and 1999-2015, opioid deaths in rural America quadrupled among 18-25 year olds.
Excited to have Howard Buffett— a philanthropist, county sheriff, &amp; businessman—join me today to share his views on the negative effects of the opioid epidemic, particularly those he’s witnessed during his time as a rural law enforcement official in Macon County, Illinois
Far too many families &amp; towns in ND have experienced the crippling effects of the raging addiction crisis—that’s why I brought together community leaders, law enforcement officers, &amp; health care professionals today in Fargo for a discussion on combating this crisis https://t.co/aeeu64gSPB

@CDCgov This ongoing mental health crisis in rural America is nothing short of an epidemic &amp; and we must stop it soon if we’re going to keep North Dakota communities and families strong &amp; safe #SummitToStopSuicide
According to @CDCgov, suicide rates jumped by 58% in ND btwn 1999-2016—the largest statewide increase in the US. Currently, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in North Dakota across all ages, &amp; the 2nd leading cause of death for youth.
My #SummitToStopSuicide brought together over 100 leaders from across ND &amp; included comprehensive sessions between experts &amp; community leaders on topics like suicide prevention, survivor support, community engagement, &amp; preventing suicide for both adults &amp; youth. https://t.co/q8Kd3xJ6va

And today I urged @USDA @SecretarySonny to improve the aid package to farmers suffering from slumping commodity prices &amp; an uncertain future for this season’s crop. The administration must make every effort to alleviate the pain &amp; resolve the #tradewar putting livelihoods at risk
Today, the administration threatened to escalate its #tradewar, which is also a threat to North Dakota farmers. I’ve long pushed to hold China accountable for its trade violations, but we can’t do it on the backs of hardworking North Dakotans. https://t.co/7axSMGbngn
This week the President signed into law my bipartisan #POWERAct w/ @SenDanSullivan.

Over the last few years, Russian foreign policy has aggressively violated the sovereignty of US elections &amp; the privacy of US companies &amp; citizens. We need to increase our resolve to deter these activities while preventing future cyberattacks on our elections &amp; businesses.

On @Medium, watch the stories from some of the 300,000+ NDans w/ pre-existing conditions who could be impacted by @TheJusticeDept's decision to turn its back on them by refusing to protect health insurance coverage for those w/ pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/s1KBIl16Rj
Belva from Bismarck was 1st diagnosed w/ breast cancer in 1998 &amp; again in 2015. Her husband, Wayne, had a heart attack while she was undergoing treatment. As survivors who live w/ pre-existing conditions every day, it’s critical that they continue to receive health care coverage. https://t.co/4PRtoHIGKX
Annelise in Bismarck was diagnosed with a chronic disease in 2010, 6 days before her 6th birthday. Without coverage for her pre-existing condition, the cost of basic necessities like insulin would be impossible to afford. Watch her story here. https://t.co/C3ujTezNP1
The health reform law isn’t perfect. We need to improve so it works for ND families &amp; biz while maintaining many of the lifesaving protections it provides. I’ll keep offering solutions Republicans &amp; Democrats should be able to agree on increase access to affordable care.
Supporting this lawsuit means supporting taking away affordable coverage for those with pre-existing conditions—it’s that plain and simple. I’m speaking out against this misguided lawsuit and the very real threat it presents to North Dakotans. https://t.co/09ujIWePzD
Today oral arguments took place in the Texas v Azar case. If the lawsuit succeeds, North Dakota families would gain nothing, and they could soon find themselves in financial ruin with the inability to afford the health care they need.
Since we passed the last #FarmBill in 2014, I’ve been working hard on #FarmBill18 to make sure it addresses the needs of North Dakota farmers &amp; ranchers. Read more on @Medium abt my meetings this year to make sure their voices are heard. https://t.co/48PNwOrVGN

✅ Boost agriculture research https://t.co/a1iewcsrcV
Mary’s son Sam has had a condition that causes severe epilepsy his entire life &amp; requires 24 hr observation, expensive equipment &amp; medications. Mary isn’t sure if they'd be able to afford health insurance if the @TheJusticeDept doesn’t defend coverage for pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/xv3azCAZ9m
I was encouraged today to hear the Republican Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee express openness to compromise on some of the House bill’s partisan &amp; harmful cuts to nutrition assistance that threaten the bipartisan coalition needed to get a bill across the finish line.
Farmers in ND are hurting as the #tradewar is depressing commodity prices &amp; throwing a wrench of uncertainty at the very time they’re taking to the fields to harvest. States like mine need this #FarmBill now to support current farmers and help build the next generation of farmers
Amanda in Fargo—a wife, &amp; mom to 2 daughters—was diagnosed w/ cancer &amp; a genetic condition in 2013, putting her at higher risk for developing other cancers. W/o affordable health care coverage, she would be unable to receive the multiple life-saving screenings she needs each year https://t.co/bGzndSMArB
To show the impact of @TheJusticeDept's decision to not protect health insurance coverage for those w/ pre-existing conditions—including over 300,000 North Dakotans—I’ve asked folks from across ND w/ pre-existing conditions to share their stories. Follow on @Twitter &amp; @Facebook https://t.co/F29Jgq48l1

New company policies like from @Microsoft are a step forward for working families.

@RepCheri Next week is the 1st mtg of the #FarmBill Conference Committee, which I’m a member of. I’ll be working hard to make sure Congress passes a strong Farm Bill by the end of the month so our ag producers can have the certainty &amp; access to important export markets they need to thrive.
The administration’s #tradewar is causing real pain for ND farmers &amp; ranchers—that’s why I announced I’ll be introducing a new bill w/ @RepCheri to use funds being brought in by tariffs to help those being harmed. We can’t sit by &amp; watch orders get cancelled &amp; markets disappear. https://t.co/MIXliHCh7k

@OliverWyman Last month, I cosponsored a bill with @SenJohnBarrasso to suspend the Health Insurance Tax through 2020 that could impact nearly 71,000 #smallbiz &amp; 200,000 workers who would see premiums increase. Successfully suspended this tax through 2019, now need to go further. https://t.co/K7SMuEwFMo
In January, I successfully delayed the health reform law’s Health Insurance Tax thru 2019. A new @OliverWyman report shows how this tax would result in higher health insurance premiums totaling over $48 million for NDans in 2020—unless Congress took action https://t.co/VErKgQK28c

North Dakota suffers from the 5th-worst pay gap in the U.S. &amp; it’s even worse for Native American women who make, on average, 62 cents for every dollar a man makes. Let #WomensEqualityDay be a reminder of the importance of ensuring mothers &amp; women everywhere have #EqualPay.
Today is #WomensEqualityDay, a day to remember when the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was certified in 1920. So many strong women before us fought for that right, &amp; since that day, we have made so much more progress for women. But there is still much work to do. https://t.co/3ryMXZGNht

I know how important North Dakota’s servicemembers are to keeping our country strong &amp; safe. This bipartisan legislation would help give them a much-needed pay raise &amp; the equipment they need, such as upgraded B-52 engines—which I’ve long fought for.
Today I voted w/ a bipartisan US Senate majority to pass a bill to support ND defense installations &amp; the contributions of our military families, as well as resources for ND’s rural communities to access affordable health care, good public schools, address childhood trauma &amp; more https://t.co/w4yY6qniut

In April at an Ag Committee hearing I reminded @USDA @SecretarySonny of the 3 words he said when we first met: "trade, trade, trade." I pushed him to stand up for rural America and protect ag producers who are rightfully worried about tariffs &amp; #NAFTA. https://t.co/vthuTybGqq
ND is feeling the harsh impact of this administration’s trade war. In July, I pushed @federalreserve Chairman Powell on the impact of the trade war on the US economy. He agreed that imposing tariffs over a sustained period time is the wrong thing to do for the economy. https://t.co/l3IsbE5WwE

Annelise in Bismarck was diagnosed with a chronic disease in 2010, 6 days before her 6th birthday. Without coverage for her pre-existing condition, the cost of basic necessities like insulin would be impossible to afford. Watch her story here. https://t.co/8eMjjuAjt7
Chris &amp; his wife from Bismarck have 2 sons, one w/ Autism Spectrum Disorder &amp; the other w/ a rare genetic disorder requiring multiple weekly therapy sessions.

@GrandSkyND @SecAFOfficial @FAANews @NorthDakotaUAS In Feb, I visited @northropgrumman &amp; #GeneralAtomics in Grand Forks where I saw developments that are putting @GrandSkyND on the map. The public-private partnership at the heart of Grand Sky is encouraging research/development of #UAS tech in ND that strengthens natl security https://t.co/kiss27nz0K
@GrandSkyND @SecAFOfficial @FAANews @NorthDakotaUAS ND is a leader in #UAS innovation &amp; research, but we need to protect against illicit use of drones, which is why I intro’d a bipartisan bill to help @DHSgov &amp; @TheJusticeDept counter the misuse of unmanned aircraft that threaten public safety &amp; natl security https://t.co/in9n0Inaeo
@GrandSkyND @SecAFOfficial @FAANews @NorthDakotaUAS I’ve long been working to boost cutting-edge UAS research in ND. In May, I helped announce w/ @USDOT that ND would be part of a pilot program to test integrating #UAS into the national airspace, recognizing our state as a proven leader in UAS research &amp; innovation. https://t.co/hqKCwbYbHE
@GrandSkyND @SecAFOfficial @FAANews @NorthDakotaUAS It’s always a boost for North Dakota &amp; our defense missions to host high-level military leaders, &amp; today’s #UAS events gave @SecAFOfficial Wilson a firsthand view of the innovation taking place at @GrandSkyND https://t.co/fHRZz02ra8
@GrandSkyND @SecAFOfficial @FAANews @NorthDakotaUAS I also spoke at the #UAS18 Summit &amp; Expo to industry leaders, #UAV manufacturers, payload providers, designers, &amp; commercial operators to highlight the #UAS industry’s positive impact on the region &amp; how to keep promoting Grand Forks as a leader in UAS development. https://t.co/4vtf6E1851
@GrandSkyND @SecAFOfficial Last week, I announced that the @FAAnews granted a 2-year authorization for @NorthDakotaUAS to fly large #UAS unmanned aircraft systems beyond visual line of sight, paving the way for today’s test flight
Had a great time this morning viewing @GrandSkyND’s historic 1st civil beyond visual line of sight #UAS test flight w/ @SecAFOfficial Wilson.

Belva from Bismarck was 1st diagnosed w/ breast cancer in 1998 &amp; again in 2015. Her husband, Wayne, had a heart attack while she was undergoing treatment.

@CFPB This week, news reports indicated the administration is weakening a separate law that helps protect US troops from financial fraud. I’m pushing back on these efforts so the federal government fully supports our servicemembers, veterans, &amp; their families https://t.co/B5OUk3WH3E
@CFPB When servicemembers put on the uniform to serve our country, they should never come home to a foreclosed home or face credit fraud. I’m proud to have gotten this important #Relief4MainStreet bill for North Dakota across the finish line. https://t.co/s9kOqqusvI
According to @CFPB, there have been 100,000+ complaints submitted by servicemembers, veterans, &amp; their families abt issues related to mortgages and foreclosures, credit cards, credit &amp; consumer reporting &amp; more, with hundreds in in North Dakota alone.
Great mtg today in Bismarck w/ local servicemembers, veterans &amp; their spouses on how my #Relief4MainStreet bill—signed into law earlier this year—strengthens protections for those who fall on hard financial times or victims of fraud, incl. veterans &amp; active-duty servicemembers. https://t.co/8gUzp3eVma

Earlier this month, I was appointed as one of just 9 senators to the #FarmBill conference committee, which is tasked w/ reaching a compromise agreement between the US Senate &amp; US House Farm Bills before the current bill expires on September 30th.
Today in Rugby I continued my discussions w/ ND farmers, ranchers, commodity groups &amp; faith leaders abt ongoing #FarmBill negotiations I’m working on, ND priorities I successfully secured in the bipartisan Senate #FarmBill18 &amp; uncertainty caused by the administration’s #tradewar https://t.co/iO8G7PhupQ
While in Rugby today to talk to farmers &amp; ranchers I made sure to visit the monument to the geographic center of North America! https://t.co/OiZ4fgZJQV
Caught this beautiful sunrise on the way to Rugby to meet with farmers &amp; ranchers about the #FarmBill, with smoke from summer wildfires in Canada causing the smoky haze over parts of North Dakota. https://t.co/spVWL4VSCK
While serving as North Dakota’s Attorney General, I helped implement the #ViolenceAgainstWomenAct statewide &amp; its reauthorization was one of the first bills I cosponsored &amp; helped pass as a U.S. senator in 2013.
Community efforts like this one—combined with federal efforts I’ve supported like the #ViolenceAgainstWomenAct— make huge differences in reducing incidents of domestic violence, keeping our communities strong &amp; safe.
Today, I met w/ community leaders, victims’ advocates, &amp; law enforcement abt how the important services offered at the new Mary’s Place facility will give the Jamestown community addtl tools to provide critical transitional housing &amp; other services to victims of domestic violence https://t.co/PiQTXanPoD
Important article from @CNN highlighting the impact of the nationwide opioid crisis on women, where rates of women addicted to opioids while pregnant have quadrupled in the last 15 years according to @CDCgov. We must do more to address this epidemic. https://t.co/CVxUZaNrxM
I’m with you, @SenRonJohnson. We need answers. https://t.co/mI9n0l4UQX
@XcelEnergyND In North Dakota there is no shortage of wind, &amp; when we can harness this natural force, it powers homes and communities, &amp; creates thousands of jobs as part of a true-all-of-the-above energy strategy. #AmericanWindWeek
Helped kick off the new @XcelEnergyND Foxtail Wind Farm project near Ellendale today. Projects like this one shows the continued growth of wind energy &amp; jobs across ND—made possible by my work in 2015 to secure a long-term tax credit extension to promote wind energy development. https://t.co/mVT7A0ivrt
Was honored w/ the Wind Champion Award by @AWEA CEO Tom Kiernan—appreciate his kind words about my work to support ND wind energy: "Her leadership in negotiating a 5-year extension &amp; then a phase out of the production tax credit is one of the reasons wind energy has this success” https://t.co/KNXVKFYCS9
Virtually every small town in North Dakota has a memorial to our #veterans &amp; those who served—the way it should be. It’s part of our identity as North Dakotans and a symbol of our values. Stopped by one while visiting Courtenay today. https://t.co/maeG5eEVVJ
On my way to Grand Forks today, I stopped to check out
the Community Orchard in Aneta. Great to see all the beautiful flowers &amp; shared plots helping educate new farmers &amp; providing fresh produce for the local community. https://t.co/W5w4gtr5F1
While the administration’s trade war is not a joke for farmers &amp; ranchers in ND, this comic in @inforum captures the concerns I’ve been hearing about the trade war’s impact on the livelihoods of our ag producers who depend on access to important export markets to thrive. https://t.co/MKh4tcnPA4
In Fargo I met w/ grandparents &amp; other caregivers who step in when biological parents are not in the picture. My #KinshipConnectionsAct would boost resources to help transition to taking care of a child &amp; my bill providing foster care tax credits would also help them cover costs. https://t.co/QCNftNQz4N
At the #NightToUnite celebration yesterday, I got to say hello to the famous @WestFargoPolice lip sync battlers, who were kind enough to give me their autographs! Thanks for all your hard work keeping us safe. If you missed it, check out the video here: https://t.co/MruHleevg3 https://t.co/FV3Z5e652I
Met w/ Northern Plains Potato Growers Assoc. members
today to hear concerns w/ ongoing #NAFTA renegotiations to make sure they’re treated fairly &amp; spoke abt my work on the Senate #FarmBill to protect crop insurance &amp; expand their access to markets to help provide needed certainty https://t.co/s32rqqj1wL
Recently, I met w/ @NDFFA state officers Brianna Maddock &amp; Caleb Boehm who shared how my #NextGenAg bill I successfully included in the Senate #FarmBill would help improve the future of agriculture in ND by providing resources to build the next generation of new/beginning farmers https://t.co/n9SNTGsZFW
Loved reading about these young boys from Fargo in @inforum—can't wait to see them take it to the @LittleLeague World Series! #LLWS https://t.co/gFi3ZqlNyk
@AWEA @GeronimoEnergy In 2017, ND was the number 1 state in the country for wind energy jobs per capita. With more certainty restored, renewable energies like wind support thousands of good jobs across our state while powering homes &amp; businesses here &amp; in states across the region. #AmericanWindWeek
@AWEA @GeronimoEnergy In 2015, Congress successfully passed a deal I negotiated to lift the 40-yr-old ban on exporting crude oil &amp; a long-term extension of tax credits to expand wind energy development. Has led to wind energy production &amp; job growth in North Dakota. #AmericanWindWeek
Honored to receive @AWEA’s Wind Champion Award today at the @GeronimoEnergy Courtenay #windfarm during #AmericanWindWeek. I’m proud to have worked to successfully extend the wind energy tax credit in 2015 to support wind energy development &amp; jobs across our state. https://t.co/I2Q1JJu9MT
@gfherald Leonard Larson was a servicemember from Colgan, ND who was killed in action in WW2. In 2015, I was honored to present a posthumous Purple Heart medal to his family to help honor his sacrifice &amp; service for our country. Read more in @inforum #PurpleHeartDay https://t.co/5r6zbtQoxL
One of my proudest moments as US senator was in 2015 when I presented Corporal Andy Shaw of Spirit Lake w/ his Purple Heart after waiting 60+ years to receive it for his service in the Korean War. Read more about Cpl. Shaw in the @GFHerald #PurpleHeartDay https://t.co/oezBvCJdXz
On #PurpleHeartDay &amp; every day, let’s thank those who have served &amp; honor the American heroes who were wounded on the battlefield or paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives to protect our freedom.
@WestFargoPolice North Dakota law enforcement plays a critical role in combating the severe opioid epidemic, stopping human trafficking &amp; keeping our communities safe. I’m proud support all the work they do. I’ll continue to fight for more resources to help them do their jobs. https://t.co/57aMdF7SQK
Was in Fargo this evening for #NightToUnite to help raise awareness about important programs that keep our communities safe, like drug prevention, town &amp; neighborhood watch, &amp; other anti-crime efforts by the @WestFargoPolice who help keep ND strong &amp; safe. #WestFargosFinest https://t.co/YqwJGONGbs
Met today w/ Dr. Jay MacGregor, Chief of Surgery at @FargoVAHCS &amp; discussed how to improve ongoing opioid safety initiatives in the VA to keep ND strong and safe, &amp; make sure our veterans get the health care, benefits &amp; services they earned. https://t.co/mypTl2t8nh
The families I met today know the toll losing a parent has on kids &amp; families—we owe it to these children to prevent further trauma by making sure they’re able to grow in loving &amp; supportive homes. I’ll keep pushing for resources these caretakers need to support vulnerable kids.
ND doesn’t have a statewide program to support them, but Kinship Navigator programs can make a huge difference for these caregivers. My #KinshipConnectionsAct would help fix that by helping family caregivers get resources to navigate the transition to taking care of a child.
The @USCensusBureau says abt 2.5 million children live w/ these caregivers without either of their parents at home. In our meeting, many caregivers explained they weren’t aware of social services or resources available to them when they took over responsibility for these children
Today in Fargo I met w/ grandparents who have adopted or are fostering their grandkids as a result of suicide, opioid abuse, &amp; other circumstances that have left the children’s biological parents unable to care for them, an arrangement known as grandfamilies. https://t.co/VEgSJexJsD
Gorgeous weather near Grafton this week, where the barley &amp; wheat harvest is in full swing! https://t.co/vhIKCdyWny
In June, I called on @SBAgov to analyze the impact of the administration’s trade policies on #smallbiz—policies that could deal a real blow to small businesses that depend on or support industries that rely on trade. Read more in @americanagnet https://t.co/VmEUxBW5Rk
As a member of the US Senate Committee on Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship, I’ve been working for years to make sure #smallbiz, which make up 99% of employers &amp; nearly 60% of all jobs in ND, have access to resources &amp; policies that help grow their businesses &amp; support local jobs
Small town Main Streets are the heart of North Dakota’s rural communities. Today in Valley City, I heard from folks about opportunities that small towns can provide &amp; how challenges—like the administration’s trade policies—can impact their bottom lines. https://t.co/LUttYx0nwj
The uncertainty caused by the administration’s trade war makes it even more critical that we finish the #FarmBill before the end of September to support the farmers &amp; ranchers most impacted by losing access to critical export markets. Read more in @KXNews.
https://t.co/cAv6t4ayG6
Great visit at the Bismarck @lionsclub today—had the chance to update folks on progress w/ the #FarmBill, how I’m standing up for farmers &amp; ranchers who depend on trade amid the administration’s trade war &amp; protecting health care for ND veterans &amp; NDans w/ pre-existing conditions https://t.co/ySYJ20juEl

@KirstenHillmanA Canada is ND’s largest trading partner w/ trade &amp; investment supporting 28,500 jobs in ND. Manitoba imports nearly $1 billion in goods from ND &amp; Saskatchewan imports over $1.5 billion. I’ll keep pushing for smart trade policies that protect these important markers for ND goods.
This week, I met w/ @KirstenHillmanA, Canada’s Deputy Ambassador to the US &amp; reaffirmed North Dakota’s interest in quickly finding a resolution to #NAFTA talks so we can give certainty to the ND producers who rely on these markets to survive https://t.co/IPGY7sioVC
Bipartisan bill I helped write &amp; intro w/ @SenPatRoberts to help address rural health care challenges successfully passed in the US Senate. It would increase affordability of local clinics &amp; hospitals &amp; seek long-term solutions for problems facing rural patients &amp; providers. https://t.co/enuhCaOoP0
Cheers to #InternationalBeerDay🍻! North Dakota exports like barley are an important part of popular beer brands like @corona &amp; @ModeloUSA. I’ll keep fighting to protect access to critical export markets like Mexico so our farmers &amp; ranchers can thrive. https://t.co/dn7tlxPhFW
For farmers in ND &amp; across the US, patience is wearing thin w/ the administration’s escalating trade war. In a new @USChamber article, farmers &amp; families share how the trade war is impacting their livelihoods &amp; shutting them out of important export markets https://t.co/ADx9WeXUIN
An escalation of the trade war w/ China is the last thing our farmers need as harvest begins. We need to rein in China by enforcing trade laws, not actions that will cause China to slap taxes on ND goods. This trade war will hurt ND more than China–not a winning strategy for ND https://t.co/BpBd2qDnCV
This week, I helped pass a bipartisan bill that would help fund pressing priorities in ND, like @USDAFSA to help our farmers in times of crisis, public safety resources on our reservations, &amp; affordable housing opportunities for our vulnerable neighbors. Read more on my website.
@uscensusbureau Native Americans have been historically under-represented in #Census data &amp; in 2017, Census tests across Indian Country were canceled. In a letter to @CommerceGov @SecretaryRoss, we called on the administration to develop a plan that will ensure they are accurately measured.
Led a bipartisan effort to hold the @USCensusBureau accountable so Native American communities are counted fairly &amp; accurately in the 2020 #Census to make sure tribes have access to necessary federal support for housing programs, social services &amp; other programs guaranteed by law https://t.co/SWutDp3H5Z
@319ABW @NDAirGuard @TeamMinot This summer, I toured @TeamMinot’s hangars, weapon storage areas &amp; missile alert/launch facilities, to stress how Minot’s missions bolster our nation’s strategic nuclear deterrent, as it’s the only @usairforce installation to host two vital components of the U.S. nuclear triad. https://t.co/WXv8YWdANe
The bipartisan defense authorization bill includes support for critical missions like Minot’s ICBMs, Grand Forks @319ABW’s #GlobalHawk, @NDAirGuard’s MQ-9 Reapers, &amp; modernizing @TeamMinot’s B-52 bomber fleet. Next, it’s headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law.
This week I helped pass a strong bipartisan defense authorization bill to support ND’s military priorities in Minot, Grand Forks, Fargo &amp; across the state—helping ensure ND servicemen &amp; women have training, equipment &amp; resources they need to keep our communities strong &amp; safe. https://t.co/VcakC7EOIy
Recently, the @USTreasury made it easier for non-profits to hide the sources of their donations while engaging in political activity.

I’ll meet w/ Judge Kavanaugh on Aug. 15 to learn more about his judicial record &amp; judicial temperament. I’ll also need to see his Senate hearing as part of a thorough &amp; exhaustive review—which is what every senator should do when evaluating a lifetime appointment to the Court.
@Medium And in August 2016, I traveled around the state to share my top priorities for the 2018 Farm Bill to make sure we can write, negotiate, &amp; pass a robust bill just like we did in 2014 to protect farmers &amp; keep rural America strong. Read more on @Medium: https://t.co/c1Cqbr5nLN
Over 2 days &amp; 7 stops around ND in August 2017, I heard the priorities of North Dakota producers so I could make sure their concerns were included as I worked on the 2018 Farm Bill. Read more on @Medium: https://t.co/abB8T4HkVX
Since we passed the last #FarmBill in 2014, I’ve been working hard on #FarmBill18 to make sure it addresses the needs of North Dakota farmers &amp; ranchers. Read more on @Medium abt my meetings this year to make sure their voices are heard. https://t.co/48PNwOrVGN
Our 2018 Senate #FarmBill includes my provisions to:
✅ Support critical safety net programs like crop insurance
✅ Reform the ARC-County Program
✅ Support #NextGenAg &amp; new/first-time farmers
✅ Provide resources to address farm stress/suicide
✅ Boost agriculture research https://t.co/gSntc22saE
Honored to be named to the #FarmBill Conference Committee as we work to make sure Congress passes a bipartisan common sense Farm Bill before current one expires at the end of Sept to give ND farmers, ranchers &amp; rural communities needed certainty in uncertain times for agriculture https://t.co/bemEgaU9Rh

@lisa @SenCortezMasto Earlier this year my bipartisan #SESTA bill was signed into law &amp; will hold sites like Backpage accountable for knowingly facilitating online sex trafficking. Take a look on @Medium at the years-long effort to score this important victory: https://t.co/oyn8GepkhG
@lisa @SenCortezMasto Read more in @bistrib about how my bipartisan bill w/ @SenJohnMcCain to expand AMBER Alert warnings in Indian Country, signed into law this year, will help make sure children &amp; families are protected on tribal lands in North Dakota &amp; across the country: https://t.co/HVNZtdADjs
@lisa @SenCortezMasto According to @OJPNIJ, 56% of American Indian &amp; Alaska Native women experience sexual violence in their lifetimes. Our bipartisan bill would establish an advisory committee to work w/ @Interior &amp; @TheJusticeDept on combating #humantrafficking of Native Americans &amp; Alaska Natives
Building on my work to keep Indian Country strong &amp; safe w/ #SavannasAct, #SESTA, &amp; expanding AMBER Alerts, I helped introduce a new bipartisan bill to crack down on #humantrafficking in Indian Country w/ @Lisa Murkowski &amp; @SenCortezMasto https://t.co/HtKb8HGgX9
@DeptVetAffairs In the Senate, I’m fighting every day to make sure our veterans get the health care, benefits &amp; services they've earned. This May, I helped pass the #VAMISSIONAct last month—now signed into law—to reform @DeptVetAffairs health care services &amp; overhaul the Veterans Choice Program. https://t.co/zyNfF6twXp
Today I called on new @DeptVetAffairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to make sure the VA makes a serious effort to understand the needs of rural veterans across ND &amp; to protect the specialized health care only the VA can provide. https://t.co/SwEVUU8trt
#Medicaid is a lifeline for so many ND individuals, children &amp; families—I’ll keep fighting against efforts to reduce access. This month, I received the 2018 Champion of Innovation Award for my work to defend affordable, accessible health care for all NDans
https://t.co/WNnYegebyn
Earlier this yr, I secured extensions to Medicare for home health &amp; rural ambulance service in the bipartisan budget deal. Every day I’m in the US Senate, I’m fighting for rural America—everyone in ND deserves reliable health care regardless of zip code https://t.co/Ai0uSCPqjn
For 53 years, #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid have enabled seniors, people with disabilities, &amp; low-income American families to get affordable, quality health care. More than 200,000 North Dakotans count on these programs &amp; we need to make sure they remain strong for the long-term.
Another great week meeting w/ North Dakotans: Shared my work for #NextGenAg w/ @NDFFA, met w/ NoDaks from the @ruralagcouncil, Reid Hartly &amp; Jamie Lund of Fargo working to end homelessness w/ @naehomelessness, &amp; @RWJF Fellow Bukola Bakare https://t.co/UTYl0wO2Ql

Amanda in Fargo—a wife, &amp; mom to 2 daughters—was diagnosed w/ cancer &amp; a genetic condition in 2013, putting her at higher risk for developing other cancers. W/o affordable health care coverage, she would be unable to receive the multiple life-saving screenings she needs each year https://t.co/1KdxN8BObB
Valerie in Mandan was born 10 weeks early &amp; had open heart surgery at 3 mo. old. After spending 100+ days in the hospital, she needs a team of doctors for the care she needs to grow &amp; stay healthy. Hear from her mom Kathryn abt the challenges they’d face w/o health care coverage. https://t.co/b64FbAnDiN
Today marks 1 year since a vote in the US Senate on a Republican bill that would have taken health care away from 34,000 NDans.

https://t.co/l6Gr8tWRHE
In a US Senate committee hearing this week, I pushed back on the administration’s proposal to reorganize several federal agencies, incl. privatizing the @USPS.

@NDStateFair A special thanks to Michael and Ann Knudson, Todd Hanson, @ndhistory, and the Halsey family for providing the included stories and photos.
Last month, the @TheJusticeDept announced it would not actively defend in court critical health care protections which safeguard over 300,000 NDans w/ pre-existing conditions. I helped introduce a resolution that would allow the US Senate to take legal action to protect them.

@NDStateFair On the Eleventh Hour of the Eleventh Day of the Eleventh Month (11:00 a.m. local time, November 11, 2018) Americans across the nation will toll bells in remembrance of those who served and sacrificed. #WW1Centennial
@NDStateFair Women joined the Armed services for the first time, while Native Americans, African Americans, new immigrants, and people from all walks of life became the American Expeditionary Forces. #WW1Centennial
@NDStateFair Over a period of just six months in 1918, this war claimed more U.S. servicemembers’ lives than Vietnam and Korea combined.  Over 116,000 U.S. servicemembers died from combat and disease and another 200,000 were wounded. #WW1Centennial
@NDStateFair This November 11th, countries around the world will mark 100 years since the end of the First World War.

Our bipartisan retirement security bills would:
✅ Help workers set up short-term savings accounts
✅ Expand access to workplace retirement
✅ Help people build emergency savings during tax time
✅ Make it easier for savers to auto enroll into long-term savings
Today I intro’d a bipartisan package of bills to help boost retirement security for people &amp; families at a time when nearly half of all American families don’t have any retirement savings &amp; more than 1/3rd of full-time employees don’t have access to a workplace retirement plan https://t.co/Noq1pS4yPA

@TheJusticeDept It’s absolutely wrong to play political games w/ the livelihoods of millions of individuals who are sick, suffer from a chronic condition, or simply happen to be older—and I won’t stay silent as we face the real possibility of their health care coverage being wiped out.
Last month, @TheJusticeDept announced it will not actively defend critical health care protections in court, which safeguard over 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions. This action could ultimately price out North Dakota families from any meaningful health coverage.
As the administration’s trade war escalates, it’s more important than ever to make sure the voices of North Dakotans are heard. Take my new survey to share your thoughts, concerns, &amp; ideas about the best way to move forward &amp; protect ND’s rural economy.

When 95% of the world’s population lives outside the US, we have to export our goods to succeed. https://t.co/HuJUXsc0zv
@USChamber Recently, Canada announced new tariffs on US goods &amp; the EU imposed $3.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs on US goods that include ag &amp; construction machinery which makes up 50% of ND’s exports to the EU. Rural America can’t afford a trade war—but we feel like collateral damage. https://t.co/a7GesY1qru
New @USChamber report: The administration’s trade war threatens $60+ million in ND exports &amp; 111,000+ jobs in ND supported by trade.

The Bank hasn’t been fully functional in over 3 years while lacking a quorum on its board. The Senate should confirm her &amp; approve 3 other board nominees without delay. https://t.co/trPjRcLepu

Worked w/ tribal communities to include Indian Country priorities in the Senate #FarmBill18:
✅ More accessible nutrition assistance
✅ Set up Rural Development Tribal Technical Assistance Office
✅ More certainty for Tribal Promise Zone designees https://t.co/PE9yrlZdh8
The Senate #FarmBill18—passed out of Committee last week—includes important provisions I fought for to support Indian Country. Too often priorities for Native communities are overlooked— I’ll fight to make sure they remain a key part as the #FarmBill is debated in the full Senate https://t.co/YvWbs45wO4
It’s a victory I’ve been fighting for since 1992 &amp; will give our state a huge boost in revenue, meaning millions of dollars in additional resources can go toward critical investments in education, infrastructure and other state projects. https://t.co/fGJ4nSMVUP
After 2 and a half decades &amp; leading a bipartisan group of senators to urge the court to relitigate the case &amp; remedy the situation, this is a great day for North Dakota businesses who will now be able to compete on equal terms with out of state online sellers. https://t.co/OLbNnMDUDs
26 yrs ago as ND’s Tax Commissioner, I brought a case to #SCOTUS in an effort to allow states to require online retailers to collect sales tax. The Court didn’t rule favorably back then, but today it overturned the original ruling—leveling the playing field for brick &amp; mortar biz https://t.co/RYNtP58NZl

Building on my efforts with my #RESPONSEAct, signed into law in 2016, earlier this year I introduced the #SafeFreightAct which would require at least 2 crewmembers on board freight trains carrying cargo like crude oil, allowing for faster responses to emergencies. #StrongSafeND https://t.co/xI1aPvSnEd
I appreciate that the president has acknowledged what virtually everyone has said from the beginning—that this was a policy started by the administration that they had the ability to reverse or fix at any time.
I'm reviewing the president's Executive Order, but I’m glad we appear to be moving toward a policy that keeps children with their parents. https://t.co/0VaBDbJhgg
4 yrs ago today, I intro’d my #RESPONSEAct to better prepare 1st responders in ND &amp; across the US for incidents like derailments of trains carrying crude oil—it became law in 2016. Since Casselton, I’ve been working hard to improve rail safety &amp; keep ND communities strong &amp; safe. https://t.co/CfK2C5Bwvy
W/ my #FUTUREAct signed into law we’re seeing new investments that will benefit US energy/innovation w/ companies like @OXY_Petroleum &amp; White Energy looking at building a new carbon capture project.

ND’s economy relies heavily on exports w/ $5.3 billion in goods exported worldwide in 2017. We proudly supply the world w/ food, energy &amp; manufactured goods—but from soybeans to farm equipment to oil, these tariffs threaten to strike at the heart of our job-sustaining industries. https://t.co/xL6rdeYZxt
I hear from farmers &amp; ranchers in ND almost every day—they have no interest in being collateral damage in a trade war. 60% of North Dakota’s exports to China are agricultural products, w/ 71% of ND soybeans exported to Asia, primarily to China. https://t.co/AlVj8cRjGs
This administration is playing chicken w/ China, creating a trade war at farmers’ expense. Yesterday's actions will hurt ND’s farmers &amp; our economy. We can be tough on China while protecting our economy &amp; workers. We need smarter trade policies that open markets, not cut them off https://t.co/G8KF6hbZGN

The bipartisan defense authorization bill includes support for critical missions like Minot’s ICBMs, Grand Forks @319ABW’s #GlobalHawk, @NDAirGuard’s MQ-9 Reapers, &amp; modernizing @TeamMinot’s B-52 bomber fleet.
Helped pass a strong bipartisan defense authorization bill today to support #NorthDakota’s military priorities in Minot, Grand Forks, Fargo &amp; across the state—helping ensure ND servicemen &amp; women have training, equipment &amp; resources they need to keep our communities strong &amp; safe https://t.co/zitBsDKzfy

#NorthDakota is the 9th largest #agriculture exporting state in the US w/ $5.3 billion in commodities exported in 2017. It’s clear we need smart trade policies—not tariffs—to keep our farm economy strong. I’ll keep pressing the administration on how its trade policies hurt ND. https://t.co/QY6nBXMkAg
I met with a group of North Dakota farmers near Grand Forks yesterday who are deeply concerned about a trade war &amp; its impact on their ability to sell their products in markets like China, &amp; these tariffs are a major reason why.
A better way to deal w/ China is to focus on #trade enforcement &amp; creating a level playing field for US farmers, ranchers &amp; manufacturers. Instead, the administration is asking ag producers to take a hit when they can least afford it—bad news for ND &amp; more uncertainty for farmers
Yesterday, the administration announced it’s moving forward w/ $50 billion in tariffs against Chinese goods &amp; causing China to respond w/ the threat of retaliation to impose similar tariffs—escalating a trade war that will hurt North Dakota farmers &amp; ranchers.
Proud of the selfless spirit of these 3 ND women working hard to help their communities, like cycling to support cancer research, sponsoring #HeritageDay events &amp; raising money to support those w/ cancer. Read more @Wahpeton Daily News #SelflessSaturday https://t.co/8N3bXYiBBw
The administration claiming to use the Bible to justify separating children from their parents is repulsive.

@inforum We also shared concerns w/ the administration’s #trade policies &amp; tariffs that could put ND’s farm economy at risk.

I’ve been pushing for my #ButchLewisAct as a legislative fix to this mess, so that we can prevent our small businesses from falling into bankruptcy, protect the hard-earned pensions of working families &amp; save taxpayers from unnecessarily footing the bill.
Congress has a moral obligation to find a solution to the #pensioncrisis for our #smallbiz &amp; their workers, who worked hard &amp; saved for retirement, only to be faced w/ severe cuts when they need it the most. We must reward hard work. Read more in @inforum

In addition to boosting Cuba market access for US ag products, it includes many key provisions I fought for to support North Dakota farmers &amp; ranchers. https://t.co/gtEQWhQiio
Our bipartisan amendment gives @USDA the ability to build reliable #trade partnerships between North Dakota producers &amp; Cuban buyers, at no extra cost to the taxpayer—important relationships as our farmers &amp; ranchers face uncertainty with tariffs &amp; the renegotiation of #NAFTA
@JohnBoozman Cuba is a natural market for ND farmers as our homegrown products like dry edible beans, peas &amp; lentils. My bipartisan 2018 #FarmBill amendment to support increased ag trade w/ Cuba builds off of a bill I’ve been pushing for years. Read more in @inforum: https://t.co/Ao2bSjozfK

ICYMI: Sunday was the 55th anniversary of the #EqualPayAct, signed into law in 1963 to guarantee equal pay for men &amp; women for the same work. We’ve seen great strides, but ND women still earn only 74% of what men do. Read more about moving forward @Medium https://t.co/bUwEpk8q7M
@NationalSheriff I’ve continued to work with local law enforcement on ways to crack down on trafficking &amp; free victims from exploitation.

Sat down with the talented folks interning in my D.C. office for the summer. We talked about their personal goals, as well as issues directly impacting millennials—a strong reminder of how the next gen will be a source of remarkable ideas to address tomorrow’s challenges. https://t.co/Wv3fv2SnqC
@FCC @Medium Your voice matters. I hear you and I’m listening to you. The Senate did its job, now the House needs to do its job as well—call your member of Congress and urge them to support strong #NetNeutrality rules.
@FCC @Medium I’m fighting for the 5,500 NDans who have called &amp; written to my office to voice their opposition to the @FCC’s #NetNeutrality repeal. For many of them, it was their first time calling a member of Congress. Read more in @NDSUSpectrum: https://t.co/s43enRs7fB
@FCC @Medium Last month, I helped pass our bipartisan Senate resolution to throw #NetNeutrality a life preserver &amp; restore these needed rules. Now, I’m calling on the US House of Representatives to stand up &amp; do the right thing by passing our resolution.

Today, the @USACEHQ released its 2018 work plan &amp; it includes $3.5 million I pushed for to help the city of Medina improve its water infrastructure &amp; tackle issues like deteriorating pipes &amp; harmful groundwater intrusion, ensuring it can safely serve the community for yrs to come https://t.co/7Hm5iB1QOm
We cannot be silent. How our gov't treats any child says so much abt who we are as a country. Articles of parents &amp; children being forcibly separated when they come across the border are horrifying. This isn't a political issue–it’s abt families &amp; children https://t.co/WOZgj5rKQg
@TheJusticeDept The message was clear—the federal government is telling you that health insurance companies can essentially bankrupt your family in exchange for your child getting lifesaving health care they need to live. No one should support this effort because it’s just cruel.
Busy week meeting w/ NDans: I brought ND ag leaders to meet Mexican Ambassador to the US to talk #trade &amp; #NAFTA, met w/ Sask @PremierScottMoe on Northern Border &amp; energy, discussed supporting caregivers w/ ND Long Term Care Assoc, &amp; shared #FarmBill priorities w/ @nature_org https://t.co/k6L4U4Iu4X
This week, @TheJusticeDept announced an unprecedented effort to allow health insurance companies to charge more if people have pre-existing conditions like asthma/cancer. The federal gov can’t recklessly strike down lifesaving protections just to score short-term political points
Today is the 55th anniversary of the #EqualPayAct, signed into law in 1963 to guarantee equal pay for men &amp; women for the same work. We’ve seen great strides, but today in ND women still earn only 74% of what men do. Read more abt needed action on @Medium https://t.co/bUwEpk8q7M

@TheJusticeDept I’ll keep pushing for commonsense, bipartisan ways to keep more North Dakotans insured, prevent skyrocketing health care increases for the elderly, &amp; protect our friends and neighbors w/ pre-existing conditions.
@TheJusticeDept We need to look for ways to improve the current health reform law—as I’ve long worked to do—but the federal government can’t recklessly strike down critical &amp; lifesaving protections just to score short-term political points.
@TheJusticeDept Imagine it was your child w/ cancer &amp; now the federal gov is telling you that health insurance companies can essentially bankrupt your family in exchange for your child getting lifesaving health care they need to live. No one should support this effort because it’s just cruel.
.@TheJusticeDept’s actions today show an unprecedented effort to purposefully allow health insurance companies to charge more if people have pre-existing conditions like asthma/cancer. The administration must stop playing games w/ health &amp; of NDans w/ serious &amp; chronic illnesses. https://t.co/qwgWlpSzc4

✅ Provide resources to address farm stress/suicide
✅ Boost agriculture research https://t.co/k5voTaUvZj
We passed a solid #FarmBill in 2014 &amp; since it became law I’ve been working on the next Farm Bill. After listening &amp; working with #NorthDakota farmers &amp; ranchers over several years, our bipartisan Senate Farm Bill is a big win for our state &amp; rural America https://t.co/abB8T4HkVX
Passing a strong #FarmBill has been my top priority since coming to the US Senate &amp; today we intro’d a 2018 bipartisan bill w/ big wins for #NorthDakota I’ve been pushing for—like maintaining a strong farm safety net, disaster assistance programs, ARC-County Program reforms +more https://t.co/A3hy0aqamN
Saddened by the news of Anthony Bourdain’s passing. He wrote a beautiful foreword for @GFHerald’s Marilyn Hagerty’s 2013 book on Grand Forks dining. His kind words &amp; genuine appreciation of ND culture is a comforting read today. Read it in full on @eater: https://t.co/i4RdhAa9ku
Sadly, suicide touches far too many folks across our state w/ rates jumping by 57.6% in ND since 1999. Recent stories remind us of the need to increase access to mental health services &amp; work to reduce the stigma in seeking help. Read more in @KFYRtv: https://t.co/oTUnSYP2ac

Will be on @SquawkCNBC at 8am ET/7am CT this morning talking about the need for smart trade policies that support ND farmers, ranchers &amp; manufacturers. 95% of consumers live outside the US - if we aren't exporting, we're losing.

Today the president signed the #VAMISSIONAct, a bipartisan bill I helped pass that will reform @DeptVetAffairs health care services &amp; overhaul the Veterans Choice Program to better serve veterans across ND &amp; the country.

@SenBobCorker For #NorthDakota farmers, ranchers, &amp; manufacturers, exporting is critical, but the administration’s wrongheaded #trade policies are putting their livelihoods at risk.

Good news: Earlier this year, I pushed @USDOT to address concerns North Dakotans have about the new ELD rules &amp; today the DOT put some of the provisions from my bill into effect immediately. Read the full updated guidance here: https://t.co/6y683zvEY5
The new ELD regulations have caused confusion &amp; hardship for haulers of livestock &amp; insects, proving once again that once-size-fits-all regulations simply don’t work for rural America.

@BrookingsInst With 95% of consumers living outside the US, if we aren’t exporting, we’re losing—NDans know that personally because they live it every day. I’ll keep fighting for smart #trade policies that create new opportunities for ND products to be sold around the world.
50% of North Dakota’s exports to the European Union are agricultural &amp; construction machinery, &amp; ND is in the top 10 most exposed states to new tariffs on steel &amp; aluminum exports (via @BrookingsInst) https://t.co/ZjIqLdIKFN
Today the administration announced it’s moving fwd w/ tariffs on aluminum &amp; steel against Canada, Mexico, &amp; the EU—all critical trading partners &amp; customers of North Dakota goods. Unfortunate the administration has started a trade war w/ our allies that will harm North Dakota.
Rural America shouldn’t be treated like collateral damage &amp; it’s insulting to expect hardworking farmers, ranchers, &amp; manufacturers to bear the negative impacts of poorly planned trade policy like tariffs on aluminum and steel.
@OberandOut Looks like a great start! Next time, try it with tater tots for an even more authentic Nodak experience.

Today is a big deal—the US Senate did the right thing in voting to restore #NetNeutrality. Proud to support this resolution &amp; fight for open, fair &amp; equal Internet access.

Great honor to get to pin two stars on the shoulder of @NDNationalGuard’s Gigi Wilz, promoted to Major General on Tuesday. I’m privileged to call her my friend &amp; I know so many women have benefitted from her leadership. She makes all of ND extraordinarily proud. https://t.co/ZyAuPjiXtX
The U.S. Senate votes TODAY to #RestoreNetNeutrality. I pushed for this vote because #NetNeutrality is an issue of fundamental fairness &amp; I'm proud to fight for open, fair &amp; equal access to the Internet that North Dakota &amp; rural America depend on. https://t.co/yyUy3SeL2Y

ND is a leader in #UAS innovation &amp; research, but we need to protect against illicit use of drones, which is why I intro’d a bipartisan bill to help @DHSgov &amp; @TheJusticeDept counter the misuse of unmanned aircraft that threaten public safety &amp; natl security. https://t.co/pAJC9gyeOB
Led a group of 30 R &amp; D U.S. senators today urging the @FCC to raise the funding cap for a program improving telemedicine access in rural areas—every person in ND &amp; across rural America deserves access to reliable health care. Read our full letter to @AjitPaiFCC here.

@SenJoniErnst @AgweekMagazine My bipartisan bill follows my work in 2015 to successfully push @USDA to recalculate ARC-CO payments for farmers who have land across multiple counties.
@SenJoniErnst @AgweekMagazine My bipartisan bill to address ARC-CO problems &amp; support farmers would improve data to make ARC-CO payments, calculate payments in farmers' physical counties &amp; make payments more accurate. Find out more on my website: https://t.co/giUnn4ckUc
Working hard on behalf of ND farmers to make sure my fixes to the ARC-Co program are included in the next #FarmBill so they’re supported through challenging times like drought. https://t.co/0AFc8Bqm5O
Farmers across ND are having problems w/ the ARC-CO program, so last Oct, I intro’d a bipartisan bill w/ @SenJoniErnst to fix it &amp; support farmers during challenging times like drought. Trying to get it in the #FarmBill. Read more in @AgweekMagazine: https://t.co/snqphqhJaX
#FarmSafetyDays are happening across ND from now until October, sponsored by @PAFSafetyDays &amp; local ND orgs. According to @CDCgov, abt 12k youth were injured on farms in 2014—don't wait to learn important farm safety skills. Find your next #FarmSafetyDay: https://t.co/BLhcWlMhu4
Mother’s Day is a time to thank our mothers &amp; it’s a reminder of why we need to support families. Women’s issues are family issues, and we need to treat them that way. Esp. on #MothersDay here a few ways we can work together to support women AND families: https://t.co/tTaoNtx9WK
Every day I come to work in the U.S. Senate, I’m fighting for rural America, and every individual and family across rural North Dakota deserves access to reliable health care.
.@SenTinaSmith &amp; I are proud of recent successes like securing funding for #CHIP, community health centers &amp; other health priorities—though challenges remain. We won’t stop fighting to support rural communities &amp; providers on the front lines servicing rural &amp; at-risk populations.
Joined @SenTinaSmith for a roundtable discussion w/ ND &amp; MN rural health leaders on the challenges of health care delivery in rural areas &amp; how critical Medicaid and Medicare are for supporting rural health. https://t.co/KxHzsPyAhs
Impacted by the #pensioncrisis? We want to hear your stories. The Joint Committee @SenTinaSmith &amp; I serve on needs your feedback as Congress works toward a legislative solution by the end of the year. Until Sept 30th you can send feedback via email to: JSCSMPP@finance.senate.gov
Workers &amp; retirees deserve a well-run pension system that rewards hard work &amp; that’s what @SenTinaSmith &amp; I are fighting to do. We're fighting for the #ButchLewisAct to be that solution.
If Congress doesn’t solve the impending multiemployer #pensioncrisis, it's putting thousands of hard working men, women, &amp; their families at risk for financial ruin—that isn’t fair. These workers &amp; retirees worked hard &amp; saved for retirement. But now it could be ripped away.
This story of a @USAirForce officer searching for his Japanese birth mother is an incredibly touching example of a mother's hope &amp; selflessness from all the people involved along the way to make their reconnection possible. #SelflessSaturday #MothersDay https://t.co/Hhur4WLR4L
Met workers &amp; retirees in @CityofFargo today w/ @SenTinaSmith to provide update on the new 16-person congressional committee we were appointed to that is trying working to solve the #pensioncrisis across the country. We're fighting to make sure stories of those impacted are heard https://t.co/HDBts6grng
I always ask students what they would do if they were not afraid of failing—your hard work &amp; dedication have paid off with your graduation from @cankdeskacikana. Now go out &amp; don’t be afraid to follow your dreams.
Congrats to all the students who graduated from Turtle Mountain Community College! Your education is invaluable &amp; will bring opportunities your way you would never expect. Good work!
A solid education is key to success &amp; the graduates @Dakotacollege are some of the best &amp; brightest. Congrats on your hard earned education!
The hard work, dedication, &amp; all the sleepless nights crashing on class papers paid off! Congrats to the graduates at @Willistonstate on finishing your degrees.

@KPSD2KHS While at @KPSD2KHS, I got to meet Brianna Maddock. She’s 1 of just 4 ND students who was named a Presidential Scholar. Such an accomplishment and I’m so proud of her! https://t.co/qw0XHtOZJi
@WCCOBelting Supporting @ExImBankUS, which I’ve long championed, is a critical part of making sure ND businesses like @WCCOBelting can grow &amp; export their products. Congress needs to get it fully functioning again, as I’ve been working to do.
@WCCOBelting 95% of consumers live outside the US. If we're not exporting, we’re losing. @WCCOBelting ships to 24 countries w/ Canada being their top international market &amp; NAFTA is key to its ability to reach it, making any disruption to the agreement potentially harmful to the business.
@WCCOBelting Tariffs &amp; #NAFTA disruptions pose a threat to @WCCOBelting’s ability to reach its’ customers &amp; we need strong, fair trade policies that support ND biz like WCCO so they can grow and hire more American workers.
Had a great tour of @WCCOBelting today &amp; saw how important #trade is to their business. WCCO is a true ND success story—a family biz that #exports its products across the world, supporting the Wahpeton community &amp; farmers who rely on their equipment &amp; employ abt 200 workers in ND https://t.co/8lGWvHvF2H
@KPSD2KHS The average age of a farmer in ND is almost 60 yrs old. My new bipartisan #NextGenAg bill would help cultivate the next generation of farmers &amp; ranchers, making sure they get the education they need for a lifetime of success. I'm working to include this in the next #FarmBill. https://t.co/80UY5ECgyJ
Inspiring to meet @KPSD2KHS students today who are passionate abt continuing our strong tradition of family farming. My bipartisan #NextGenAg bill would help students in Kindred &amp; across the state launch successful careers in agriculture that support rural communities. https://t.co/yOWaY0sxxJ
Congrats to @KPSD2KES in Kindred on being recognized as a 2017 National Blue Ribbon School! I had a great time talking to 3rd &amp; 5th graders abt leadership &amp; public service—their teachers have done an incredible job preparing them for success. Amazing school spirit! #ThankATeacher https://t.co/JoPgKcz1Io

Thanks for hosting Doyle &amp; me at #BarleyToBarstool! Always glad to share how much ND farmers rely on #trade &amp; #NAFTA. https://t.co/DImNwAt9xO
North Dakota exports like barley make their way into popular beer brands like @Corona &amp; @ModeloUSA. I’ll keep fighting to protect &amp; expand markets for our farmers &amp; ranchers to give them the certainty they need to build and maintain their business relationships. #BarleyToBarstool https://t.co/feEZWV3I4r
Had a great time at the #BarleyToBarstool discussion to talk abt the importance of #NAFTA to ND ag producers. We need smart trade policy so the barley &amp; other products we export to Mexico, Canada, &amp; elsewhere can reach the 95% of the world’s consumers outside of the U.S. https://t.co/OcWN4zmpMh
@AirForceAssoc @TeamMinot @319ABW @NDNationalGuard We need tough, smart national security strategies to keep American families safe.

@AirForceAssoc Promoting North Dakota’s role in critical national security missions through its work at @TeamMinot, Grand Forks @319abw &amp; the @NDNationalGuard is one of my top national defense priorities for a #StrongSafeND https://t.co/j12DRa0Jw1
With many threats to US national security across the globe, it’s more important than ever that our country is doing everything possible to keep American families safe &amp; to support our servicemembers. Honored to share my natl defense priorities this morning w/ the @AirForceAssoc. https://t.co/rMG8pv8YA8
Helped introduce the new #FossilEnergyLeadershipAct w/ @Sen_JoeManchin to forge a viable future for ND coal &amp; coal jobs by supporting research &amp; tech that will bring us closer to a clean &amp; secure energy future. It builds off my #FUTUREAct that became law &amp; the #USEITAct. https://t.co/b4gdI7mDTA

.@GPTCHB are in DC to discuss priorities important to Native communities in ND, SD &amp; NE. Important that our tribal leaders have a seat at the table as Congress drafts a new #FarmBill, combats opioid addiction destroying families &amp; works to increase Native women/children safety https://t.co/8syJPvWYLx
Met w/ @StandingRockST Tribal Council to discuss a range of issues from land transfers, national grasslands, &amp; how we can improve the criminal justice systems to keep tribal communities safe. https://t.co/1aOz8y60sI
Often when students from ND come to visit we discuss the role of our federal government. But today w/ students from the MHA Nation we discussed the unique role between the federal government &amp; tribal governments &amp; how we must work together so future generations can succeed. https://t.co/MrjIWEc9Lb
#MothersDay is a good reminder of the need to support working mothers (&amp; fathers) in ND who still aren't eligible to earn a single paid sick day. Clearly our workplace policies don't reflect our strong family values. My #FAMILYAct would change that w/ a federal #paidleave policy. https://t.co/lZRcrMXN7B
@FCC We just need one more senator to support a bipartisan resolution to reinstate #NetNeutrality—just #OneMoreVote &amp; we can stop internet access from being bought by the highest bidder.
@FCC Repealing #NetNeutrality is bad for families, students &amp; rural America. I heard from over 5,500 North Dakotans stating their dismay at the repeal &amp; I’m fighting for them to get it back. Now we just need #OneMoreVote in the Senate to reinstate net neutrality. https://t.co/Bohvl09W2N
Last month, the @FCC officially repealed #NetNeutrality rules that protected fundamental fairness on the Internet &amp; prohibited internet service providers from blocking, slowing down, or discriminating against online content.
@USDOT #UAS innovations in ND help farmers’ crops grow, monitor energy infrastructure &amp; protect the #NorthernBorder. Now w/ addtl resources from @USDOT, these public/private sector relationships will help realize the potential for UAS to boost economies &amp; create jobs around the country.
In 2016 I successfully pushed the @FAANews to authorize the @NorthDakotaUAS Test Site as 1st in the US to conduct beyond-visual-line-of-sight ops. Now, its unique expertise will help the @USDOT integrate UAS into natl airspace in a safe &amp; sustainable way. https://t.co/Aipi6UWI9K
Excited to announce w/ @USDOT that North Dakota will be part of a pilot program to test integrating #UAS into the national airspace, recognizing our state as a proven leader in UAS research &amp; innovation—advancing ND as the epicenter of UAS talent, jobs, &amp; ideas. https://t.co/zG9iKBA8ai

@SBAgov Farmers, ranchers, &amp; all #smallbiz owners know just how important it is to have access to foreign markets, &amp; they deserve to know exactly how the administration’s proposed tariffs would affect their ability to succeed &amp; compete, that’s why I’m urging @SBAgov to look more closely. https://t.co/csCILykrDz
Called on @SBAgov to analyze the impact of the administration’s tariff policies on American #smallbiz—policies that could deal a real blow to small businesses supporting the majority of jobs in ND &amp; across our country.

#SavannasAct would also require certain federal agencies to solicit recommendations from Tribes on improved access to local, regional, state &amp; federal crime databases &amp; criminal justice
information systems during the annual consultations mandated by the #ViolenceAgainstWomenAct
The crisis of missing &amp; murdered indigenous women urgently needs more attention, which is why I intro’d #SavannasAct help law enforcement crack down on these horrible crimes. We must make sure women like Savanna are #NotInvisible https://t.co/Orx354IfnG

@SenatorCollins @USDA After introducing my new bipartisan #NextGenAg bill today, I’m working hard to include these four of bills of mine that support rural America in the upcoming #FarmBill. https://t.co/HHJZitz9z8
@SenatorCollins @USDA Our bipartisan #NextGenAg Act would:
✅ Extend the Beginning Farmer &amp; Rancher Development program beyond 2018
✅ Change crop insurance beginning farmer definition to farming less than 10 yrs from 5
✅ Direct @USDA Sec to create a next gen ag tech challenge competition
&amp; more https://t.co/GuXCD4gra8
@SenatorCollins According to the @USDA, farmers in North Dakota are 57 yrs old on average &amp; the % of new farmers has declined since 1982. Without efforts to cultivate the next generation of farmers, rural economies could suffer. #NextGenAg
Today w/ my friend &amp; colleague @SenatorCollins, I introduced the bipartisan #NextGenAg bill that would help new &amp; beginning farmers &amp; ranchers enter the industry. I'm working to include this in the next #FarmBill.
During our meeting today w/ the Professional Insurance Agents of ND we discussed the important issues of flood insurance, crop insurance, and health care. https://t.co/4BNLkgFG4w

Over the last few yrs, I’ve been facing the opioid abuse epidemic head on by bringing former White House Drug Czars to our state, holding meetings across ND on the issue, &amp; introducing multiple bills on it. Proud to keep moving forward with my provisions included in this new bill
The bill also includes key pieces from one my earlier bills on this issue to address &amp; mitigate the detrimental impact of childhood exposure to trauma, like opioid abuse, which can effect negative health, educational, &amp; behavioral consequences over several generations.
The new bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act passed out of a US Senate committee yesterday &amp; includes my provisions to address the ripple effects of the crisis on children, families in rural &amp; tribal communities—continuing my fight against the opioid addiction &amp; abuse epidemic. https://t.co/Z148NpbeML

@FCC In February I spoke w/ the @DakotaStudent about why restoring #NetNeutrality is important for North Dakotans &amp; how we need 1 more vote in the US Senate to reverse this misguided decision. Read more: https://t.co/9T2hv7YMhK
@FCC Without net neutrality, there can be slow lanes &amp; fast lanes on the internet. And if you’re stuck in a traffic jam, only those who pay more may be able to get out of it. That isn’t fair &amp; it goes against the values of a free internet that boosted innovation &amp; entrepreneurship.
@FCC North Dakota businesses are worried about higher online business costs, &amp; many working families &amp; millennials are anxious about rising internet rates &amp; limited access. Let’s #SaveTheInternet &amp; allow North Dakotans to thrive.
@FCC Chatted w/ the @NDSUSpectrum about what the repeal of #NetNeutrality means for millennials &amp; how they can get engaged in the ongoing effort to restore internet freedom. https://t.co/s43enRJIEb
@FCC I’ve heard from over 5,500 North Dakotans about net neutrality--many high school and college students. All but 10 of them support strong net neutrality rules. They want strong #NetNeutrality that fosters healthy competition &amp; innovation that benefits ND’s economy &amp; consumers.
@FCC In the U.S. Senate, we’re on the cusp of forcing a vote to protect net neutrality—we just need #OneMoreVote to pass our resolution. This isn’t about politics, it’s about protecting consumers &amp; small business, especially in rural areas. #RestoreNetNeutrality https://t.co/qTSCSZhogc
@FCC We must reverse this decision. Restoring #NetNeutrality is needed to level the playing field for all internet users. Equal access to the internet shouldn’t depend on the size of your business, number of service providers in your area, or how much money you make.
Net Neutrality is an issue of fundamental fairness and is about guaranteeing everyone’s freedom to access the internet. Unfortunately, today the @FCC’s repeal of #NetNeutrality officially takes effect. https://t.co/KrY7OjKlMN

If Congress doesn’t solve the impending multiemployer pension crisis, it's putting thousands of hard working men, women, &amp; their families at risk for financial ruin—that isn’t fair. These workers &amp; retirees worked hard &amp; saved for retirement. But now it could be ripped away.

@fema “Senator Heitkamp’s #RESPONSEAct will help make sure training for first responders is available and affordable so we are best able to deal with the situation and ensure the safety of the responders" — Tim McLean, Casselton Fire Chief https://t.co/JwUAVSxHXt
@fema The Casselton derailment was the impetus for my Strong &amp; Safe Communities Initiative which I launched in 2014 to address emerging challenges facing ND &amp; bring a greater focus to keeping ND communities strong &amp; families safe in their homes. Read my report: https://t.co/4wrmRkURWO
@fema For ND communities to be strong &amp; safe 1st responders need every tool possible to take action when disaster strikes. Looking fwd to working to implement these recommendations so we take every step toward safety in our communities #RESPONSEAct #StrongSafeND https://t.co/ICXNWk0E85
@fema As a result, this new valuable report contains actionable recommendations to help 1st responders &amp; those who support them. They often have to overcome obstacles to receive HAZMAT training, such as large time commitments, need for unpaid time off of work, the cost of travel.
@fema My bipartisan #RESPONSEAct, signed into law in 2016, established a public-private council that combined emergency responders, federal agencies, &amp; leading experts to review training and best practices for first responders. https://t.co/mxzhX8Tjmb
.@FEMA released a report on rail safety preparedness required by my bipartisan #RESPONSEAct, which I introduced following the Casselton train derailment in 2013 to seek out ways to give 1st responders the training &amp; resources to handle hazardous incidents—it became law in 2016.
Not surprised Bismarck is one of @CNBCMakeIt’s 20 best small American cities to start a business. I’ll continue to support small business and startups across North Dakota. https://t.co/TuVVLTpTvr
My provisions in the Opioid Crisis Response Act would: 

✅ Establish Interagency Task Force 

✅ Increase funding for Nat'l Child Traumatic Stress Initiative

✅ Provide grants for mental health support in schools 

✅ Address health professional workforce shortages
Provisions come from a bill I introduced to address the harsh impact exposure to trauma can have on children &amp; families. Abuse, neglect, witness crime &amp; mental illness are traumatic experiences &amp; can lead to a lifetime of health &amp; behavioral challenges. https://t.co/IBiTQEwic6
Children are too often the unspoken victims of the opioid epidemic, which is why I successfully fought to include provisions in a new comprehensive, bipartisan Senate bill to tackle the consequences of the trauma inflicted on kids, including from opioid abuse.

@SenSherrodBrown @EximBankUS We should want to win on trade, compete w/ China, rein in our trade deficits &amp; level the playing field for US businesses. Confirming a quorum for the @EximBankUS would make a huge diff. by restoring Bank to full strength &amp; putting that economic engine back to work for Americans.
@SenSherrodBrown @EximBankUS In 2015, Senate Republican leaders allowed a vote to reauthorize @EximBankUS because it was the “will of the Senate.” As a result, 64 senators voted to reauthorize the #ExIm Bank, as did 70% of the House. It’s still the will of the Senate. https://t.co/CDmOHXR9nz
@SenSherrodBrown @EximBankUS For 2.5 yrs, the @EximBankUS hasn’t been able to fully function b/c it lacks a quorum on the board. As a result, there are over $35 billion in deals stuck in the pipeline. The Bank estimates this supports roughly 250,000 American jobs. The Senate must vote on these nominees.
Tonight, @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I called for the nominees for the @EximBankUS to get votes. Unfortunately, our request was objected to &amp; the Bank, which has supported American jobs &amp; businesses for over 80 years, remains in limbo—putting us at a disadvantage against other countries https://t.co/yDpxIXvJ97

@USTradeRep I’ll keep fighting for the ability of rural communities to survive &amp; thrive—and keeping critical markets open for farmers and ranchers is key piece. Read more in @inforum abt why smart trade policies—not tariffs—are needed to support ND farmers https://t.co/rrEfB2IHNx
@USTradeRep Uncertainty caused by potential Chinese tariffs, U.S. tariffs on aluminum &amp; steel &amp; NAFTA talks is already making ND producers nervous, esp. as farmers are making difficult decisions about planting season. Must hold China accountable, but these tariffs would hurt ND farm families
@USTradeRep North Dakota is the 9th largest agriculture exporting state in the U.S. w/ $5.3 billion in goods exported worldwide in 2017. The bottom lines of ND farmers, ranchers, &amp; workers depend on sensible trade policy that keeps foreign markets accessible to our exports. https://t.co/O1DWxf2dEs
Pressed @USTradeRep to protect ND’s ag &amp; manufacturing sectors. With 95% of potential customers living outside our borders, guaranteeing ND farmers &amp; ranchers have fair access to export to foreign markets is critical. I have regular calls w/ Lighthizer which will cont.

@USCBO Each Congress I’ve cosponsored a balanced-budget amdt to keep our fiscal house in order. As Congress spends, it must assess how those funds will yield returns in the long-run while protecting Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security, critical programs for families, children &amp; seniors
@USCBO This @USCBO report shows that our country is on a historic &amp; downward fiscal path that is not sustainable &amp; risky for the future of the U.S. An unfortunate truth that this generation inherits from our parents &amp; borrows from our children. I refuse to allow that to continue #TaxDay
@USCBO The @USCCBO also forecasts that U.S. debt will rise to more than $33 trillion in 2028 &amp; that the estimated deficit for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected for that year in June 2017—mainly because of the Republican tax bill. #TaxDay
On #TaxDay, it’s important to take a look at the recent @USCBO report which projects that the deficit &amp; national debt will significantly increase over the next several years, in large part due to the Republican tax bill which the report now estimates will cost $1.8 trillion.

Read more in the @bistrib about my work going back to 1992 on Quill v. ND which was relitigated before the Supreme Court today. I have a long history with this case and fighting for ND retailers in towns across our state: https://t.co/HQcewEklbK
I’m hopeful that SCOTUS will finally overturn its ruling in the Quill case to help our small businesses compete—which is particularly important in the digital age as large online retailers have impacted mom &amp; pop shops &amp; allow ND to begin to collect sales tax on online purchases.
Congress would still maintain the authority to resolve any issues that arise once this this imbalance has been corrected by the Court—but our states and brick &amp; mortar businesses need this certainty now.
After 2 1/2 decades &amp; an effort in Congress to remedy the situation that has been stalled in the House, it’s clear that the SCOTUS must act to correct its misguided ruling in 1992.
Since then, I haven’t given up the fight to level the playing field for brick-and-mortar businesses that communities rely on, especially in rural America, which is why I pushed for the court to bring up this case today.
It was an amazing experience to be back in the Supreme Court 26 years after I sat in the same room listening to arguments in Quill v. North Dakota, which I helped bring before the Court as North Dakota’s Tax Commissioner. https://t.co/W6oMvUCJe0
25 years ago, as North Dakota’s Tax Commissioner, I brought the Quill Corp vs North Dakota case to the Supreme Court to fight for fair treatment for our Main Street retailers. I’m back at the court today, now as a US senator, as the case that I worked on is relitigated.

Congress can examine the best long-term strategy to stabilize the region, protect lives, and pressure Assad’s Russian and Iranian backers to acknowledge the serious nature of the Syrian government’s chemical weapons use and violation of international norms.
Particularly during these fraught times, I'm thinking of our servicemembers both at home and abroad. Going forward, Congress must be involved in decisions about further action and must vote to authorize military force.
Any U.S. military action in the region must be wary of dragging our armed forces into a protracted and broader conflict in the region, especially as our military faces challenges impacting U.S. interests around the globe.
Now we need to see from the administration an updated, clear strategy that carefully considers the next appropriate military and diplomatic steps while avoiding an extended military conflict.
Assad must be held accountable for his egregious human rights violations and the gassing of his own people—a crime against international law and humanity as well as an act of unspeakable cowardice.
The images of chemical weapons attacks on innocent civilians in Syria - including children - are incredibly sad and disturbing. The international community must condemn such horrific actions and not allow them to take place.

For years, I’ve been working on legislation to reform the @USPS, improve how it works esp. for rural America, and make it financially viable. Recently introduced bipartisan bill. Hope this task force seriously considers our thoughtful &amp; carefully crafted bill.
Yesterday, the president signed an executive order creating a new task force on the U.S. Postal Service. We must act quickly to revitalize the @USPS &amp; it’s important for the task force to examine why it’s in its current financial state. https://t.co/Gd76exqMGp
My heart goes out to the families &amp; loved ones in Humboldt for their tragic loss. North Dakotans &amp; our Canadian neighbors are united by the shared culture &amp; community of hockey, and we’re by your side through this difficult time. #HumboldtStrong #PutYourSticksOut https://t.co/u1bAqbnCx6

This proposed budget shows the president’s priorities—and that matters. It would eliminate or reduce important programs for Indian Country from tribal law enforcement support initiatives to housing assistance grants &amp; that sends the wrong message to Native communities.
Raised concerns in a US Senate committee hearing on how the president’s proposed budget would cut law enforcement &amp; public safety programs in Indian Country &amp; endanger safety in tribal communities.

@senrobportman @SenBlumenthal @SenJohnMcCain @clairecmc @JohnCornyn My fight to end human trafficking will not end. Today we took a huge step forward, but we must continue to fight against slavery in any form to protect women &amp; children across North Dakota, the country, and the world.
Our bill shows that Congress can work together, Republicans &amp; Democrats, to get results. It’s been a privilege to work w/ @senrobportman @SenBlumenthal @SenJohnMcCain @clairecmc &amp; @JohnCornyn over the past several years on the investigation into Backpage &amp; our bill.
I’m proud of our bipartisan work to move #SESTA across the finish line &amp; we need to stay vigilant as we fight to end sex trafficking &amp; sever the chains of victims in North Dakota &amp; across the country. https://t.co/EHrc67NR1A
Having passed the US Senate last month with overwhelmingly bipartisan support in a 97-2 vote, #SESTA will provide prosecutors &amp; victims new tools to go after those who try to profit at the expense of some of the most vulnerable citizens in communities around the country.
The president just signed #SESTA into law—my bipartisan bill to hold websites like Backpage accountable for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking online—in a major win for trafficking victims &amp; their families who deserve immense credit for their bravery to stand up &amp; fight back.

The #FAMILYAct, a bill I helped introduce to create a federal #paidleave policy, would help support working families &amp; help close the wage gap. Read stories from North Dakotans on why it's needed on @Medium: https://t.co/OoPilCfI9W
Getting a fair salary is a family issue and we need to treat it that way. Congress must also pass #PaycheckFairnessAct to help close the wage gap. Republicans have blocked this bill multiple times, but pay equity shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Will cont. to push to pass this bill
Paid family leave is critical in addressing the wage gap &amp; we will continue to see that wage gap exist if Congress does nothing. By providing equal opportunities to women &amp; meeting the needs of both new mothers &amp; fathers, we will build stronger families and a stronger ND economy
The #FAMILYAct would provide working families with the paid flexibility to care for their loved ones while also boosting the ability of small businesses to support &amp; retain employees, &amp; would help close the wage gap. https://t.co/sWA4sBqo3Z
Last year I helped introduce the #FAMILYAct to create a federal paid leave policy that would help support working families and help close the wage gap by making sure women don’t have to choose between their families &amp; their jobs. https://t.co/cD9Ek3zeLr
Today is #EqualPayDay &amp; I’m calling on Congress to take swift action to promote pay equity for women in the workplace &amp; boost financial security for working families.

@USCBO It’s an unfortunate truth that this generation inherits from our parents and borrows from our children. I refuse to allow that to continue. This @USCBO report shows that our country is on a historic &amp; downward fiscal path that is not sustainable &amp; risky for the future of the U.S.
The @USCBO projected today that the deficit &amp; national debt will significantly increase over the next several years, in large part due to the Republican tax bill which the report now estimates will cost $1.8 trillion. https://t.co/mgjKV6bT4y

Every day I come to work in the US Senate fighting for ND and rural America. Here's a snapshot of what I've been up to recently, some of NDans I've met, and some of the issues I've been working on—and have gotten some wins on for our state.
I hope the president to help grow our rural economy, not endanger it, by working in a constructive manner to support agricultural producers and rural economies.
China must be held accountable for its record of trade abuses and intellectual property theft, but the administration’s drastic trade policies would instead come back to hit American farmers and ranchers where it hurts. https://t.co/mrtQoAUS7p
Tariffs on critical exports like soybeans would cripple ND’s ability to sell our products &amp; we’d most likely face an impending farm crisis. For over a year, I’ve been raising alarms within the administration about how its trade policies could severely impact ND ag producers.
Today I urged the president to seriously consider the negative consequences of potential retaliatory Chinese tariffs against American farmers &amp; ranchers, whose families would be directly &amp; would have less money in their pockets due to a trade war. Read my full letter here.
I’m not naïve. I know these crimes will continue elsewhere, but working to stop every platform for sex trafficking, especially some of the largest ones like Backpage, must continue. Today's action is critical progress for ending slavery and keeping our communities strong and safe
Today, Backpage was shutdown. It’s a huge step. Now no child will be sold for sex through this website—not in ND, the US, or around the world. Proud of the 2 yr long Senate investigation I was part of that helped lead to this point. And next week #SESTA will be signed into law. https://t.co/Wj5sT2lot0
Through my work on the Senate Small Business Committee, I’ll keep working to make sure the needs of women business owners are heard &amp; addressed so they have the right economic tools needed to thrive. https://t.co/iClTwn5lw7
Also talked about how the federal government can better help small businesses get off the ground, whether that is from common-sense regulations, start-up funding, or simply providing the certainty needed to make long-term decisions. https://t.co/PoERlLt96z
ND ranks as one of the top states for women starting &amp; growing a business, w/ over 20k women-owned businesses. Also ranks 4th in the nation for # of new women-owned businesses, as well as growth in employment &amp; revenue.

Question 2️⃣: “Do you think checks and balances are important?” I think they’re critical—hear how our three branches of government work together to maintain our representative democracy. ⚖️ https://t.co/5u2MTGqxeF
Yesterday I visited the 4th &amp; 5th grade classes at Robert Place Miller Elementary in Bismarck studying influential North Dakotans like Lawrence Welk, Josh Duhamel, Keith Bear, Carson Wentz. I’m honored they are also studying me, so I sat down &amp; answered their questions! Thread 👇 https://t.co/veh6kNcjaA
Also talked about how I’ll look closely at the president’s new VA secretary nominee &amp; examine whether he’s qualified to run such a critical agency. I’m concerned about the rush toward privatization &amp; remain firmly committed to robustly funding the Veterans Health Administration.
I’ll cont. focusing on balanced, seamless care outside the VA &amp; pushing back against cuts to existing VA facilities &amp; specialty care programs. We have a sacred commitment to those who served &amp; need to deliver health care, benefits &amp; respect we promised them for their sacrifice.
Also heard important feedback today on how to expand #veterans’ ability to access quality care, restore faith in the VA system &amp; hold the future administrator of the Choice Program to the same standard as our VA hospitals and clinics.
@DeptVetAffairs North Dakota’s community clinics &amp; hospitals deserve better than the shoddy treatment they received from Health Net &amp; last week I supported the VA’s decision to terminate its contract.
Today I met w/ North Dakota #veterans, health care providers &amp; local @DeptVetAffairs leaders in Bismarck to discuss challenges related to the Veterans Choice Program https://t.co/dDeG2WOaVY
Escalating the potential of a trade war w/ China is reckless and it gambles the livelihoods of US farmers &amp; ranchers across rural America. 60% of ND’s exports to China are agricultural products. China’s unfair trade policies need to be reined in but this isn’t the way to do it. https://t.co/DVgQGob8eK

Spoke today at @LigniteCouncil’s annual mtg in Bismarck about how I’ve been working to support ND’s energy industry, secure coal jobs &amp; encourage investment in carbon capture tech while reducing emissions w/ my #FUTUREAct 45Q tax credit expansion signed into law earlier this year https://t.co/3vLJ00lKX9

For #MLK50 today I wanted to share this quote that captures why I’m in public service—to help others by living out my commitment to building strong &amp; safe communities: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’ —Martin Luther King, Jr. (1957) https://t.co/BeR7SeFHcl
The story of these backpacks is an example of the character of our North Dakota communities. The spirited efforts by Mayville’s students should make us pause &amp; consider what we’re doing to actively live out our commitment to those in need, much like Ann Nelson did during her life https://t.co/wuykg63Grs
I’m proud that my office was able to work with the US Embassy in Nepal help remedy a difficult customs situation &amp; ensured that the backpacks could be delivered.
In Ann’s memory, her close friend &amp; Mayville educator Mary Stammen &amp; students raised funds to purchase 200 waterproof backpacks students in Nepal whose school was damaged in an earthquake. https://t.co/fLt99TXOYI
The Backpacks for Nepal project was inspired by the life of Ann Nicole Nelson from Stanley, ND, who perished during the terrorist attack on Sept. 11th, 2001 on her fourth day at work at the World Trade Center in NYC.
Was honored to visit Mayville’s Peter Boe Jr. Elementary School today to celebrate the success of the Backpacks for Nepal project w/ 200 new backpacks delivered to children in Nepal! https://t.co/ZpO9hejQlz
@BurrosHillsboro @Microsoft @tealsk12org Programs like @Microsoft @TEALSK12org promote a learning experience that is needed for many of today’s in-demand jobs. I know these @BurrosHillsboro students will continue leading the charge in ND where our key industries like #UAS are thriving just 40 miles away in Grand Forks. https://t.co/dWP694vrEm
@BurrosHillsboro @Microsoft @tealsk12org With the U.S. facing a labor shortage for those qualified to enter computer science careers &amp; when only 1 in 4 schools offer computer science classes, it’s important to engage students at a young age so we continue to be the innovative global leader &amp; grow our diverse economy. https://t.co/sXwK7ob1FK
@BurrosHillsboro @Microsoft @tealsk12org I sat down w/ students who taught me a few basics of computer science and coding. While I won’t be writing an app any time soon, what I learned most is that this program has had a big impact on these students in preparing them for a 21st century education. #GirlsWhoCode https://t.co/vGn5fZGEtc
Thrilled to meet @BurrosHillsboro students today who are gaining valuable computer science education in the @Microsoft @TEALSK12org program, which brings together industry professionals &amp; educators to make sure graduating students have cutting-edge skills they need to succeed. https://t.co/dGRq7aPtJq
@NDSoybean Between 2016-2017, North Dakota exported $1.5 billion worth of soybeans to Asia. China’s proposed tariffs on American imports, sparked by the administration’s unnecessary push for a trade war, will directly impact the livelihoods of farmers &amp; ranchers in ND &amp; across rural America https://t.co/g4p31uPIGT
According to @NDSoybean, 71% of North Dakota soybeans were exported to Asia between 2016-2017, primarily to China. Keeping open access to these important markets is critical for the success of our farmers &amp; ranchers. https://t.co/Da5tu87YlR
For rural America to thrive, the government needs to support policies that will help it grow—but the administration’s trade policies would instead put a stake in the heart of agricultural communities. https://t.co/4bwLdmzalw
North Dakota’s farmers &amp; ranchers need to be able to export their products, yet these potential tariffs from China on American soybeans &amp; many other agricultural products would severely impact the bottom lines of our farmers &amp; ranchers.
China’s announcement today of plans to impose a 25% tariff on American soybeans &amp; other ag products is a direct result of the administration’s proposed tariffs on China, bringing us closer to a trade war that American producers cannot afford.
Kinship Navigator programs can make a huge difference for kinship caregivers, but ND doesn’t have a statewide program to support them—my new bill would help fix that. Along w/ organizations like PATH North Dakota, we’ll keep fighting to give these vulnerable kids a bright future.
Also proud to help secure $20 million in the recent bipartisan spending agreement for programs to help these vulnerable kids.
When family members like a grandparent step in to care for a child they often don’t know where to turn for help providing health care, housing &amp; other services. Today we discussed the bipartisan bill I introduced to help connect these caregivers to the support networks they need.
Great tour of PATH North Dakota today, a child &amp; family services agency—had the chance to talk w/ North Dakotans doing important work with families, children, foster care, &amp; kinship caregivers. https://t.co/5FEGwUczvm
Soybeans are a major ND export, but the administration’s unnecessary trade war is leaving soybean growers feeling uncertain about the future. We need smart and stable trade policy, but current policy will only hurt ND’s farmers &amp; ranchers in the long run https://t.co/Y5sgC9Dpot
They deserve all the tools &amp; resources necessary to carry out their vital missions effectively—I am committed to fighting for their continued support from Congress. ND is extremely proud of the unmatched professionalism &amp; determination displayed every day by our #HappyHooligans.
Great tour of the @NDAirGuard #119thWing base today in Fargo. Had the opportunity to see the Happy Hooligans’ expertise &amp; facilities up-close, including their cutting-edge remotely piloted capabilities. Their high-level skills are one of ND’s finest exports. https://t.co/z0LWzajjmU
@USTreasury "It means so much to us to have Senator Heitkamp serving on the new congressional pension committee [...] and we know she will make sure our voices are heard as this committee gets to work." —Dennis Kooren, head of the Fargo Cmte to Protect Seniors Rights &amp; UPS driver for 30 yrs https://t.co/NJXbw4OH5y
@USTreasury Workers &amp; retirees did everything right by working for decades to support their families, but now, through no fault of their own, their pensions could be taken away. That isn’t fair &amp; they deserve a well-run pension system that rewards hard work &amp; that’s what I’m fighting to do. https://t.co/0heweSX4ym
I will be hosting events in ND to contribute to the committee’s work—like bringing Ken Feinberg to ND to talk abt potential solutions. He was the @USTreasury official who oversaw restructuring of the Central States Pension Plan &amp; played a key role in supporting workers &amp; retirees
I helped make sure this committee was created as part of a bipartisan budget deal Congress passed in February &amp; I’m pushing to make sure our bill to fix the pension crisis is seriously considered. It’s tasked with finding a solution by year’s end.
Joined workers &amp; retirees today in Fargo to give an update on the new 16-person bipartisan congressional pension committee I was appointed to, tasked w/ solving the pension crisis threatening thousands of North Dakota retirees, &amp; retirees across the country. https://t.co/fAGAgchzlo

@SanfordHealth This club sends a powerful message to the thousands of ND #veterans, active duty, &amp; military families who walk through @SanfordHealth’s doors every month— your service is valued &amp; we are committed to providing you the best medical care &amp; support possible.
Thrilled to be able to speak earlier today at the grand opening of @SanfordHealth Fargo’s new veteran’s club. The new 1,100 sq ft space will host area veterans, active duty servicemembers, National Guard &amp; Reserve, &amp; family members who visit Sanford Fargo for care &amp; treatment. https://t.co/7FRl0OiJHb

Very proud of this bipartisan win that will help protect children &amp; families on tribal lands in North Dakota &amp; across the country. https://t.co/0uiGc4E86w
My bipartisan bill would require performing accurate counts of Native American students we can get federal ed. resources to the students &amp; schools that need them. Important &amp; positive step fwd, &amp; I’ll keep working to make sure every Native student has the opportunity to succeed. https://t.co/XVuUgMN3Z3
According to recent @USCensusBureau estimates, about 500,000 potentially eligible Native American students are excluded from accessing federal resources to help meet their unique cultural &amp; academic needs.
Too often schools serving American Indian &amp; Alaska Native students lack resources to address those students' specific needs &amp; when the federal government works to improve these schools with federal programs they often are underfunded or are not implemented as intended.
Recently, my bipartisan bill making sure Native American students receive the federal education support they need was passed in the US Senate!

For #WomensHistoryMonth I wanted to share how much fmr Sen. Barbara Mikulski inspired me to make sure women’s voices are heard in the US Senate &amp; to make children’s health &amp; safety a priority like protecting them online w/ #SESTA, securing add’l 10yrs #CHIP reauthorization + more https://t.co/j5hcSnXgcy
The visit was the conclusion to almost a year of work by the students to honor the lives &amp; sacrifices of fallen North Dakota soldiers in the Vietnam War. A true privilege to be involved &amp; to help share their stories. #VietnamVeteransDay https://t.co/iPQcr3Pmbr
For #VeteransDay, I joined them at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC to place their artifacts in front of each servicemember’s name on the wall. #VietnamVeteransDay https://t.co/yT0ByGenPQ
On #VietnamVeteransDay, remembering the hard work by Bismarck High School students in 2015 who spent months researching &amp; making artifacts representing the North Dakotan servicemembers lost in the Vietnam War. https://t.co/rGqvOFfHFk
@FargoAirMuseum Today and every day, we should remember the stories of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Watch this video to hear more about some of North Dakota’s bravest. https://t.co/fcBsf0kXWY
@FargoAirMuseum As we reflect on the events and meaning of the Vietnam War, we should never forget the sacrifices made by those North Dakotans who put on a uniform and fought to keep us safe. #VietnamVeteransDay https://t.co/6DUwtEDz5i
Proud to visit the @FargoAirMuseum to honor the service of ND’s Vietnam veterans on #VietnamVeteransDay. 198 NDans lost their lives or went missing in Vietnam &amp; we owe them all the support we can give &amp; to renew our promise to protect their benefits, health care &amp; quality of life https://t.co/aPKRWxqFJx
@FHC_Cares As we continue to face challenges in our health care system, I won’t stop working on a bipartisan basis to ensure quality, affordable care is accessible to all North Dakotans
@FHC_Cares Community Health Centers play an important role in the delivery of health care in Fargo and across ND, which is why I fought to boost their funding &amp; improve their ability to provide affordable care to those who need it the most.
Great to meet the staff &amp; tour the main @FHC_Cares clinic in downtown Fargo today. Discussed how their new clinics are helping to expand important health care services. Community health centers in ND provided care to 40K+ people last year alone. https://t.co/onRHFnLh9v

@SenJohnBarrasso @SenWhitehouse @SenCapito My bipartisan #USEITAct would also support federal, state, &amp; non-gov collaboration in the construction &amp; development of carbon capture &amp; sequestration facilities, further enhancing our efforts to provide a path forward for coal-fired power in North Dakota while reducing emissions
@SenJohnBarrasso @SenWhitehouse @SenCapito This bill builds on my bipartisan #FUTUREAct, recently signed into law, which will encourage carbon capture innovation &amp; investment while reducing carbon emissions. Read more in the @gfherald: https://t.co/CaGU5pgJrN

@USPS Unless Congress acts act now to stabilize the @USPS &amp; give it the tools it needs to thrive, it will go insolvent, taking this critical service away from rural communities that need it. https://t.co/mSP6dHrzK7
There’s no substitute for the @USPS in rural America, that’s why I introduced a bipartisan bill to put it on firmer financial footing, &amp; help improve mail delivery &amp; service in our rural communities. https://t.co/ky0Y6rRwp3

@SenJohnMcCain Making AMBER Alerts more accessible to Indian Country is critical to making sure children &amp; families are protected on tribal lands in North Dakota and across the country #StrongSafeND https://t.co/ehFllB9T2h
@SenJohnMcCain Our bill will expand AMBER Alerts—child abduction warnings—in Indian Country. Alerts are critical for law enforcement to generate leads quickly. Right now they aren't available in many parts of Indian Country, or are limited to tribal lands. But our bill will change that. https://t.co/TW3ktJEK8j

Everyone in ND has a family member or friend who has served in the military &amp; we are incredibly proud of their bravery &amp; service. But I cannot support picking a top advisor who will put the lives of young NDans at risk—and that’s my greatest fear of having Bolton in this position
We need tough, smart national security strategies to keep American families safe. Our complex world requires that those strategies are based on a sophisticated understanding of the inter-relationship between military force, diplomacy &amp; trade.
After US forces have been in Iraq and Afghanistan for 15 yrs and counting, where we have lost thousands of lives &amp; spent trillions of dollars, it should be clear that war must be a last resort. Bolton doesn’t feel that way.
John Bolton has demonstrated time and time again that he views military force as the answer to all problems. That’s frightening considering where we stand w/ North Korea and Iran.
"Livestock emissions" is just DC speak for 💩, &amp; there's no reason ND farmers &amp; ranchers need to report cow patties to the @EPA. They have much more to worry about. Introduced bill to change that &amp; give farmers &amp; ranchers a break, &amp; it became law https://t.co/6uoW6wt6s7
@uscensusbureau Exciting news for kids &amp; caregivers in North Dakota who rely on these services—I’ll keep pushing to help connect kinship caregivers with every resource available to help protect vulnerable kids in our communities #NDStrongSafe
@uscensusbureau Our bipartisan bill will help these kinship caregivers access programs to ease their transition to guardianship &amp; help them manage the many challenges &amp; responsibilities that come with their important role in a child’s life.
According to the @USCensusBureau, approx. 2.5 million children live in the care of a grandparent or other relative, without either of their parents in the home, often due to circumstances like a parent addicted to drugs.
New bipartisan gov’t funding bill signed into law today includes $20 million to help children remain in the care of a family member when a parent is unable to remain their guardian, a setup often called #kinshipcare https://t.co/plLX3XYPCZ
Last week I announced 2 fed. grants for over $10mil to the Solen &amp; Oberon School Districts for new elementary schools.

To strengthen rural America, we need to focus on protecting markets for the goods we produce &amp; expanding opportunities for industries in our state—not on putting our economy at unnecessary risk of retaliation
ND agriculture producers are already rightfully concerned about another unnecessary trade war stoked by unwise steel &amp; aluminum tariffs &amp; the uncertainty surrounding #NAFTA renegotiations
China hasn’t lived up to its #trade commitments w/ the US, but an unnecessary trade war would harm North Dakota’s farmers &amp; ranchers. China is one of the largest export markets for ND goods—60% of our exports to China are ag products https://t.co/YjP9Xjnv0a
Such an important step that our bipartisan bill will soon become law to hold websites like Backpage accountable for sex trafficking on their sites. Still much work to do to end human trafficking &amp; I'll keep fighting every day so all our children &amp; communities are strong &amp; safe
@SenatorCarper @clairecmc @JerryMoran @USPS Congress needs to act now to stabilize the Postal Service and give it the tools it needs to thrive—otherwise it will go insolvent, taking this critical service away from rural communities that need it.
Introduced a bipartisan bill today w/ @SenatorCarper @clairecmc &amp; @JerryMoran to help stabilize, preserve &amp; improve the @USPS, an essential part of our nation’s infrastructure &amp; economy that rural America depends on. 📩📫 https://t.co/c7PGXk47kw

After the intense flooding of 2009 &amp; 2011, the city deserves to keep permanent, comprehensive flood protections in place so families &amp; business are safe from potential floods.
Exciting news for Valley City! I made sure the new congressional funding bill includes a provision I wrote to allow an important floodwall to remain in place. Without this fix, FEMA would have forced the wall’s removal, sticking the city with the bill. https://t.co/TK57TpBB2g

Farmers &amp; biofuel producers are important parts of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, &amp; they support good-paying jobs in North Dakota and across rural America. We must keep fighting for our rural communities and farmers, and I urge the administration to reject a RIN price cap.
If the administration takes this action, it would undercut our farmers and biofuel producers at a time we should be bolstering our renewable fuel industry—not sabotaging it. https://t.co/1Hn8SKjVax

Before we wrote #SESTA to hold sites like Backpage accountable for sex trafficking on their sites, we 1st held a 2 year Senate investigation into Backpage. This is from a 2017 hearing where I condemned Backpage for its actions &amp; shamefully hiding behind loopholes in federal regs. https://t.co/xyvloTlIVQ
Sometimes Congress can be a discouraging place b/c partisanship too often prevents policy from getting done. But it’s days like today that are key reminders of how members of Congress can work together to reach results. And that’s what I try to do every day in the U.S. Senate.
Thrilled to see this bill moving forward, especially during #WomensHistoryMonth, reminding us how much work is still needed to ensure women &amp; children are protected in our country.
Helped write &amp; introduce this bill w/ a bipartisan group of 5 other senators, after a 2 year investigation into Backpage’s role in enabling online sex trafficking, including in North Dakota
It’s already passed in the House &amp; will now head to the president’s desk to get signed into law. I hope it’s signed quickly so we continue to protect children in North Dakota &amp; across the country from the misery of sex trafficking. #SESTA
Our bipartisan bill helps victims of sex trafficking seek justice by closing loopholes &amp; eliminating federal liability protections that allowed sites like Backpage to assist, support, or facilitate sex trafficking online. #SESTA

Urged @USDOT @SecElaineChao this week to address concerns about new ELD rules. A 1-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work for ND &amp; rural America, &amp; the new rule clearly lacked input from those who will be impacted the most.
@USDOT And engage w/ ND ranchers &amp; recreational rodeo enthusiasts alike that depend on our nation’s highways to move livestock to market &amp; participate in rodeos. ND needs workable guidelines to protect perishable food grown in our state to protect our rural economy.
Requested action this week from @USDOT &amp; I'm encouraged to see that the administration has taken additional steps to alleviate the concerns our agriculture transporters have with the new ELD rule. Moving forward, the DOT must continue to engage w/ members of the ag community https://t.co/Ame5n6HleD

@BPC_Bipartisan Curious how my bipartisan #Relief4MainStreet bill which passed in the US Senate today will make it easier for rural Americans to get mortgage loans from their local community banks &amp; credit unions? Find out how in this @CNBC article: https://t.co/W2uSua9WU2

For years, I’ve been working with my R &amp; D colleagues on a plan to give community banks &amp; credit unions the freedom to focus on their customers—not on unnecessary paperwork.

#Relief4MainStreet also strengthens consumer protections for seniors, veterans, servicemembers, &amp; those vulnerable to or victims of identity theft. https://t.co/upVHyMQD0r
By unburdening small lenders from fed. regulations designed for big Wall Street banks, they can better provide mortgages or loans to expand small businesses &amp; family farms. https://t.co/OI6arm1HNK
Today my bipartisan #Relief4MainStreet bill passed in the U.S. Senate with robust support from Republicans &amp; Democrats. It will provide needed relief for community banks &amp; credit unions so they can support borrowers &amp; families in ND &amp; rural America. https://t.co/MguZtxLYNn
Don’t believe me? Just ask @BarneyFrank, who said this week that: “Nothing in this bill in any way weakens the prohibition about making shaky loans, loans to people with weak credit and packaging them into a security.” #Relief4MainStreet https://t.co/38OKxo2BX8
Second, my #Relief4MainStreet bill will not lead to another mortgage crisis like in 2008. Our bill maintains essential mortgage protections Dodd-Frank put in place. https://t.co/wiQ1Ldan15
Important to address the inaccurate claims being made about my bipartisan #Relief4MainStreet bill. To start with, this bill is not a giveaway to Wall Street banks, but makes targeted commonsense fixes that provide tangible relief 4 community banks &amp; credit unions in rural towns. https://t.co/750c3phcvV

@60Minutes @Oprah @SenatorDurbin We must shine a light on the adverse experiences well over half of U.S. children have encountered &amp; for too long have threatened the lives of Native American young people. Our bill would help do just that by making sure community professionals are prepared to support our families
Excellent @60Minutes report from @Oprah on the causes &amp; impact of childhood trauma. My bill w/ @SenatorDurbin would provide a more trauma-informed supportive law enforcement/health service/workforce network that children/families, esp. in tribal communities, need 4 healthy growth https://t.co/EmiqGPLgys
This @nytimes article shows that most companies are using the vast majority of their benefits from the Republican tax bill to pad their own profits, not support workers https://t.co/izl0MoLpkL
@IEA This new report shows why the #FUTUREAct gained such broad bipartisan support—because carbon capture technology is an effective way to create more opportunity in the energy sector while addressing current environmental challenges. https://t.co/ojGwyrKvsP
New @IEA analysis on my bipartisan #FUTUREAct, now signed into law, shows it will have a key role in expanding development &amp; deployment of carbon capture utilization and storage tech, paving a viable path fwd for ND coal while reducing emissions https://t.co/nj8FH9jC3I

Met w/ Canada’s @AmbMacNaughton &amp; Consul General @PJConnors 🇨🇦 to discuss how important #NAFTA #trade is to North Dakota’s farmers, ranchers, manufacturers &amp; energy producers. https://t.co/DFLgrKCxas
@senrobportman @clairecmc @JohnCornyn @SenBlumenthal @SenJohnMcCain Hope the U.S. Senate quickly passes our bill so we can provide victims &amp; prosecutors w/ expanded ability to pursue justice. https://t.co/Hah8SvnLBQ
Our bipartisan bill w/ @SenRobPortman @clairecmc @JohnCornyn @SenBlumenthal @SenJohnMcCain would help crack down on the horrific abuse of enslaved men, women, &amp; even children permitted by these sites. https://t.co/ClTiKZv3mg
No company should knowingly facilitate illegal sex trafficking online, let alone make a profit from it. These horrific crimes are happening across the US &amp; in ND. Websites like Backpage shouldn’t be allowed to hide behind the 1st Amendment. https://t.co/jERLEqQu0o
Bipartisan #SESTA bill I helped write &amp; introduce passed in the U.S. House yesterday. Critical step in holding accountable websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking &amp; ensuring justice for trafficking survivors.
Helped introduce a commonsense bipartisan bill w/ Sen @JeffFlake to extend #DACA protections &amp; strengthen our border security. Isn’t the permanent fix many of us would like to see, but it’s a bipartisan path fwd &amp; allows Congress to work toward a long-term solution for DREAMers https://t.co/mjA9zRNgHQ
Spoke to the Carbon Utilization Research Council abt important work being done in carbon capture, utilization, &amp; sequestration technology—incl. through my bipartisan #FUTUREAct that became law &amp; will promote this tech &amp; maintain viable path forward 4 coal while reducing emissions
.@AmericanLegion supports our military &amp; veterans—we must support them. Meeting w/ these ND members reiterates the importance of also standing with the men &amp; women in uniform #LegionStormsHill https://t.co/wKHC5jQyAt
Had a great discussion w/ the Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers Association about the important next steps we can take to craft a strong Farm Bill and support trade that grows economies in rural communities. https://t.co/RD3KJgxsyc
Spoke w/ @nabtweets and met w/ NDans about how local news &amp; broadcasting are critical to supporting local communities. Must make sure they can continue to operate &amp; provide that valuable resources for towns across ND. https://t.co/pYM66HXGBg
As ND’s fmr AG, always enjoy catching up w/ other fmr AGs who also serve in the US Senate incl. @SenatorTomUdall who was NM’s AG at the same time as me.

Chatted w/ NDans in DC w/ the @AANMember on the need to invest brain research as well as how to manage pain w/o contributing to the opioid epidemic #NOH18 https://t.co/vlRXCPMEdb
Met w/ @NDFoodBank in DC for the National Anti-hunger Policy Conference to discuss need for a strong new Farm Bill supporting nutrition programs for ND seniors, women, children, &amp; infants—@NDFoodBank operates in 99 ND communities to help stop hunger in our state #hungerpc118 https://t.co/fMIUmFwkET
Couldn’t agree more. UND should bring back its women’s hockey program – to honor the athletes who built the program that was taken away &amp; give aspiring girls a strong women's hockey program and strong women to look up to. Let's not just talk about equality but act on it. https://t.co/DAKwthI53h

Good hustle @CoryBooker &amp; @SenatorTester! Let's make this a slam dunk 🏀 for restoring #NetNeutrality! https://t.co/8O2AWkhdj6
North Dakota startups are worried about higher online business costs, &amp; many working families &amp; millennials are anxious about rising internet rates &amp; limited access. Let’s #SaveTheInternet &amp; allow North Dakotans to thrive.
I’ve heard from over 5,500 North Dakotans about net neutrality. Only about 10 opposed it. The thousands of others voiced their support for #NetNeutrality that fosters healthy competition &amp; innovation that benefits ND’s economy &amp; consumers.
#NetNeutrality ensures basic fairness on &amp; equal access to the internet. That freedom shouldn’t depend on the size of your business, number of service providers in your area, or how much money you make. #OneMoreVote #SaveTheInternet
I’m supporting a Senate resolution to restore #NetNeutrality &amp; level the playing field for all internet users—we just need #OneMoreVote to pass it. This isn’t about politics, it’s about protecting consumers &amp; small business, especially in rural areas. https://t.co/8siB9ebByi
@SenatorCollins @HHSGov Recent studies suggest nearly 1/3rd of women trafficked in America saw a health care professional while they were still captive &amp; that increased training of health professionals could help make sure victims get the protection &amp; care they need. https://t.co/n6qeS3SfeJ
@SenatorCollins The #SOARAct would build on the success of a @HHSGov pilot program which has already trained almost 60 health workers in New Town &amp; Williston in North Dakota, strengthening community efforts to combat human trafficking. https://t.co/dkDPnWKsxs
The bipartisan #SOARAct I helped introduce w/ @SenatorCollins was passed by the U.S. House yesterday—important step in providing health care workers across the country w/ training on how to recognize, report &amp; intervene when seeing patients who may be human trafficking victims.
To anyone who’s spent time in our great state, it’s not a surprise @usnews ranked North Dakota #1 in quality of life. A strong sense of community &amp; supporting each other are important ND values that help make our state so wonderful. https://t.co/m5SIdyL7iz
Every minute counts in AMBER Alert situations &amp; we must continue the fight to give law enforcement agencies at all levels the tools they need to prevent crimes &amp; bring criminals to justice. Also why I introduced #SavannasAct &amp; fight every day to keep ND communities strong &amp; safe.
@SenJohnMcCain AMBER Alerts are a valuable tool in critical first moments after someone goes missing. Indian Country can be remote &amp; vast, &amp; lack of consistent AMBER Alert system results in delays in law enforcement &amp; community members being alerted when a child has been abducted/goes missing.
My bipartisan bill w/ @SenJohnMcCain to make AMBER Alerts more accessible to Indian Country passed the U.S. House yesterday—looking forward to more progress in passing this law, which is critical to improving safety on tribal lands in North Dakota. #StrongSafeND https://t.co/MuO3Jt23dX
A survey of Morgan Stanley analysts said 13% of the corporate savings from Republican tax bill will go to workers, while 43% of that money will go to investors. Workers need long-term, permanent tax relief, but instead corporations are winning the day with this tax bill. https://t.co/KlVDnFii47
The #ButchLewisAct I helped write &amp; introduce would put pension plans back on solid footing so workers, retirees &amp; employers have the security of knowing their pensions will be available for decades to come. Congress must act to prevent severe cuts to their hard-earned savings.
Helped create the new bipartisan Committee working to solve the pension crisis as part of the bipartisan budget agreement earlier this month, building on my years of work w/ workers &amp; retirees across ND to safeguard their retirement savings from harsh cuts. https://t.co/P7v17VUAuR
Honored to serve on new 16-person bipartisan Committee tasked w/ solving pension crisis threatening 2,000 hard-working NDans who paid into the Central States Pension Fund. This will force Congress to address the pension crisis &amp; I’ll push for the #ButchLewisAct to be the solution
Still can't stop grinning about the #usawomenshockey #GOLD several days ago. @JocelyneUSA17 &amp; @moniquelam7 &amp; the entire team are inspirations to all of us. They reinforce why girls and women's sports are so important &amp; why we need to invest in them. #NDpride
Honored to be chosen as a finalist in @congressfdn's 2018 #DemocracyAwards for Transparency &amp; Accountability. I'll keep working hard in the U.S. Senate to make sure my fellow lawmakers &amp; I are accountable &amp; responsive to the needs of ND &amp; rural America. https://t.co/2pvGfRgpId
My #FUTUREAct becoming law is an important bipartisan victory, supported by coal companies, electric utilities &amp; enviro. groups.

As the opioid &amp; meth crisis continues to drain local resources, pushing for bills like this one and taking other steps can make sure our communities are strong and safe.
That’s why I helped introduce a bill that would provide additional funds to prevent substance abuse, treat addiction, &amp; support recovery efforts in rural America. https://t.co/l8GZxgr0hG
With 25% of Americans impacted by the opioid epidemic, we need to take meaningful action to fight this crisis now. https://t.co/VAcxC6iPcw
In Hazen, I met with the folks on the front lines of the growing opioid &amp; meth epidemic in rural North Dakota. Read more from @AgweekMagazine https://t.co/lw32zRW2EF

Earlier this week, I sat down with Beulah-Hazen community members to talk about how rural North Dakota is being impacted by the ongoing opioid and meth epidemic. Watch this @KXMB piece to see how we are working together to fight this crisis. https://t.co/e5rDz0O9Bg
I also chatted with the @NDSUSpectrum about what the repeal of net neutrality means for millennials and how they can get engaged in the ongoing effort to restore internet freedom. https://t.co/2ZsETeD18z
A few weeks ago, I spoke with the @DakotaStudent about why restoring #netneutrality is important for North Dakotans and how 50 of us in the US Senate are fighting to reverse this misguided decision.  https://t.co/4jBdlHXvgF
Today the FCC published its wrongheaded repeal of #NetNeutrality rules, meaning rural communities and consumers will lose out. The federal government needs to be on the side of North Dakota families and small businesses on this issue—not mega-corporations and their profits.
Incredibly proud of @teamusa @usahockey's amazing women incl. ND's own @jocelyneusa17 &amp; @moniquelam7 for the Olympic #gold win vs #CAN! Way to bring it home!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
At least 25 percent of everything we grow in America is exported, and there’s no way you can tell producers that you’re going to have to cut back 25 percent-ND barley farmer @lentzfarms on the need for trade on this episode of ‘The Hotdish’ https://t.co/bHJWAAIAH9
Released the newest episode of my podcast, ‘The Hotdish’! In this episode I sat down w/ ND barley farmer @lentzfarms &amp; a former U.S. agriculture trade negotiator, Darci Vetter to discuss the need for strong export markets like #NAFTA

As the opioid crisis keeps draining local resources, pushing for bills like this one &amp; other actions can make sure our communities are strong &amp; safe. I’ll keep discussing long-term bipartisan solutions to tackle this addiction epidemic, like when I helped introduce #LifeBOATAct https://t.co/1dz8Bwh8WT
Helped introduce bills &amp; pushed to boost number of doctors able to work in rural America and underserved areas, and improve health care delivery &amp; service in rural areas. https://t.co/bxCkTaLpeF
Every individual &amp; family across North Dakota should have access to the quality, accessible, affordable health care they deserve. And that means we need health professionals in every community to help patients in need.
@Minotstateu Unfortunately, the administration's budget would cut over $1.4 billion in fed. funding supporting health care workforce programs, including nursing training. I’m fighting against these cuts &amp; have put forward bipartisan ideas to tackle health care challenges facing rural areas.
Toured the @MinotStateU Department of Nursing today, a great example of the forward thinking approach we need to address the nursing shortage facing ND &amp; across rural America. Faculty &amp; resources here prepare students for careers in this in-demand industry. https://t.co/QgklAAvW1S

Budget agrmnt also supports our veterans by funding VA hospital &amp; clinic construction, &amp; extends the Indian Employment Tax Credit to support econ. opportunity in Indian Country. In these partisan times, these are important bipartisan wins for ND that I’m proud to have fought for.
Pushed to boost rural health care in ND through many provisions I fought for in the recent budget deal signed into law, incl. by reauthorizing #CHIP for 4 add'l yrs &amp; supporting community health centers.

Hopeful that the solution the Committee produces will restore the promise we made to our retirees – that if you work hard and play by the rules you can have the dignified and secure retirement that you paid into. Read why it’s so important: https://t.co/7tyn4dEpHP
This Committee isn’t the immediate, permanent solution we hoped for, but it’s a step in the right direction. And it will force Congress to finally address this severe pension crisis – and I’m pushing for that solution to be the Butch Lewis Act, which I helped write &amp; introduce.
These workers &amp; retirees worked hard their entire lives, often in labor intensive jobs, to support their families &amp; save for retirement. Without action from Congress, their retirements could disappear. It’s up to Congress to pass a long-term solution that prevent cuts to pensions
Successfully pushed to include in the budget deal Congress recently passed a bipartisan House &amp; Senate Joint Select Committee tasked with solving the pension crisis threatening the pensions of thousands of workers &amp; retirees across ND &amp; US.

Incredible!!! @JocelyneUSA17 making #Olympics hockey history! 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/SohNDzsNKQ
I hope to be part of a bipartisan conversation about strengthening our infrastructure and making rural America stronger than ever.
The outline put forward today raises concerns about the burden it would place on rural states and local jurisdictions, but more details and analysis of this infrastructure plan are needed to determine how it would impact North Dakota.
I’ve met with senior administration officials about infrastructure and have consistently pushed for any plan to prioritize rural America.
While I’m concerned about cuts to many programs that support rural communities, one bright spot is funding for the modernization of @TeamMinot’s B-52s. I’ve long pushed to support B-52s to keep our military installations strong and boost our national security.
Rural housing, conservation, rural economic development, and early education would all take a hit.
Affordable health care would again be at risk for millions of Americans, as this plan revives dangerous proposals to threaten access to care and weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
Farmers and ranchers suffering from the ongoing drought need a stronger safety net, but this budget would cut crop insurance and put our farm economy at risk.
The president's budget is a statement of the administration’s priorities, and once again it appears that rural America is left behind.
Proud to speak 2nite before the screening of @WindRiverMovie by @NIWRC—I will keep fighting to share the stories from families of missing &amp; murdered Native women in ND &amp; across the country so they are #NotInvisible &amp; to call for action on moving #SavannasAct forward in Congress https://t.co/I5gYRBRfQP

When almost half of North Dakota’s private-sector workforce isn’t eligible to earn a single paid sick day, it’s clear our workplace policies don’t reflect our strong family values. Let’s pass the #FAMILYAct to change that. https://t.co/xNmRrY2vI8
Must pass the #FAMILYAct b/c no family should have to choose between a loved one and their job. Bill would create federal paid leave policy with 12 weeks of partially paid leave, so our families &amp; businesses thrive. https://t.co/tCzcGIR1YE
In case you missed it, watch my floor speech earlier today on why we need for Congress to pass the #FAMILYAct https://t.co/f0PjYTWdtW

Tune in shortly to watch my live floor speech on the #FAMILYAct: https://t.co/QXfdwU8YDP
Eliminating @ONDCP programs like #HIDTA would recklessly endanger the lives of thousands of Americans. Congress &amp; the @WhiteHouse have a responsibility to fund effective responses to this national emergency. https://t.co/afpc9H6qXh

Called on Senate leadership to immediately reauthorize funding for community health centers, which play an important role in the delivery of health care—especially for low income Americans &amp; in rural areas like North Dakota https://t.co/GacfcVOLci
My push to protect @ONDCP’s important grant programs &amp; meeting with #HIDTA today, including 6 meetings across North Dakota to discuss combating the opioid epidemic, are part of my continued fight to find real solutions for treatment and prevention for the ongiong opioid epidemic.
@ONDCP @WhiteHouse Also met today with #HIDTA Midwest Director Jeffrey Stamm to discuss ND drug trafficking trends, how law enforcement agencies are adapting to new threats, &amp; how HIDTA funds are being used to rein in drug crime in ND. https://t.co/7IrHez0NCt
The @ONDCP is a critical agency working to prevent &amp; treat opioid addiction. I’ve joined with fellow R &amp; D senators to urge the @WhiteHouse to avoid cutting its funding by 95%, which could devastate successful ND anti-drug programs. https://t.co/gbF8TiQaNh

Important @washingtonpost article about how the yearly US deficit is expected to hit $1 trillion by 2019, in large part b/c of how expensive the GOP tax bill is, which puts the exorbitant cost onto a credit card account to our children &amp; grandchildren without a plan to pay for it https://t.co/gonGCJgcur

It’s past time for Congress and the administration to enable the investigation to determine the facts about Russian interference in our election without political sideshows or pressure and follow the rule of law.
Unfortunately, it becomes clearer every day that Russia’s goal of creating chaos and division in the U.S. and delegitimizing our most important institutions is succeeding. This memo is the latest example.
There is no question that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. That is fact. We know they have interfered in the elections of other countries as well, seeking to create distrust and disorder.
And it’s a distraction to create a hyper-political food fight around a non-partisan and independent investigation. This memo is politics at its very worst.
It’s a distraction to try to turn the focus of this critical investigation into a smear campaign on law enforcement officers who have dedicated their lives to protecting our national security and keeping American families safe from criminals, terrorists, and other adversaries.
The goal of the public release of the Nunes memo is clear: distraction. It’s a distraction from a valid, important, and fact-based investigation into Russian interference in our election.
Honored to join @_MealsOnWheels volunteers on their route in Grand Forks today. I'll do everything I can do help #SaveLunch by fighting for continued federal support of these critical programs that enable our seniors live with dignity in their own homes. https://t.co/qJNEimiz57

@smartunionworks The #SafeFreightAct builds on my efforts since derailments in Casselton &amp; Heimdal to improve rail safety. Take a look at some of the important highlights as we’ve worked to build a safer &amp; stronger communities across ND. https://t.co/VHMPx2Od2B
"North Dakota’s rail workers are at the forefront of keeping communities safe while transporting the raw materials, goods, &amp; products that keep our economy thriving." —Jim Chase, @smartunionworks Transportation Division’s ND Legislative Director https://t.co/EGRGKTNitV
"Senator Heitkamp’s legislation is a common sense way to increase safety for those living close to railways and prevent the huge disruptions an accidents can cause." —Janelle Pepple, Wells County 911 Coordinator #SafeFreightAct https://t.co/9kjoEljVIj
Appreciated the chance to sit down with @hprfm to talk about how I’m fighting for ND by protecting retiree pensions, strengthening our Northern Border, &amp; moving #SavannasAct forward https://t.co/e4Ji9ilLhg
Casselton Fire Chief Tim McLean: “This legislation will help rail freight transportation become safer &amp; help mitigate the risk it poses the communities that may be in harm’s way.” #SafeFreightAct https://t.co/w1GntXvFTF
I’ll continue leading the push for the @WhiteHouse &amp; @DeptofDefense to commit to funding the modernization our B-52 bombers—important for ND &amp; American safety. https://t.co/STT9BuhWaj
My bill also builds on my efforts to act on recommendations from the first responders on the front lines of protecting ND communities. https://t.co/t78lOq8CCa
Glad to keep moving forward in improving our rail safety standards with the #SafeFreightAct! https://t.co/vmV74PJW4v
My bill builds on the Strong &amp; Safe Communities Initiative that I launched in 2014 to address emerging challenges in ND, like crude on rails &amp; first responder preparedness. In 2015, held my Strong &amp; Safe Communities Summit w/ 150 ND leaders on building strong future for ND. https://t.co/cNlxC0qH85
Having 2 crewmembers onboard the crude oil train that derailed in Casselton in 2013 allowed them to act quickly to contain the fire. But trains can still be operated w/ only 1 crewmember. My bill would change that &amp; help protect crewmembers, first responders &amp; nearby communities https://t.co/SB2bewidy9
Introduced the #SafeFreightAct which would require at least two crewmembers on board freight trains carrying cargo like crude oil &amp; allow for faster responses to emergencies. Read more: https://t.co/ZwPZprMfWH https://t.co/QPhYMhZr3p

Tune in to @NewDay tomorrow at 8:25am ET/7:25am CT as I'll talk about #SOTU&amp; talk about my guest to the event, Dennis Kooren from Fargo, who has been a leader in helping protect the pensions of thousands of retirees from cuts due to no fault of their own.
Dennis is in this fight b/c he cares so much about the hundreds of thousands of UPS drivers, grocery supply workers &amp; others who worked hard to earn their retirements. They will be left in the cold if Congress doesn’t act. Read many of their stories: https://t.co/W43TaDCtSM
That’s why I helped write &amp; introduce a bill to put the Central States Pension Fund back on solid footing &amp; protect retirees &amp; their families. Dennis joined me when I announced this bill in ND in Nov. Congress needs to pass it. Read about it from @bistrib: https://t.co/ulkVLJQqZ4
It's an honor to have Dennis Kooren from Fargo join me as my guest to #SOTU2018.

Going on @NewDay in just a few minutes to talk about  bipartisan efforts to reach a deal to reopen the government. Tune in.
Busy day of negotiations continued today. Been in &amp; out of meetings w/ bipartisan group of 20+ senators to forge a path to reopen gov't. It isn’t every day that kind of bipartisanship happens in Congress. Hopeful more progress is made tonight.
Just left a bipartisan meeting of 20 senators. Good discussion and hopeful we can continue to move forward.
If members of Congress can’t fulfill their basic duty to keep the government open &amp; provide the essential services Americans depend on, then they don’t deserve their paychecks. Period. https://t.co/ekmRUpJoE0
I want to find a long-term solution to keep gov't operating. I want to work w/ Rs &amp; Ds to find that compromise. I want to focus on legislation to protect workers, families &amp; retirees. And I want NDans to have a gov’t that works for them. Congress must work together &amp; do its job.
Congress needs to focus on protecting pensions 4 retirees, children’s health care, funds 4 the opioid crisis &amp; reach a bipartisan agreement on strengthening border security while enabling young immigrants who came here as children to stay in the only country they know &amp; much more
By failing to reach a larger funding agreement, Congress is spending its time jumping from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis, instead of working on important issues that need to be addressed immediately.
I’ve been calling for a bipartisan deal, and it’s disappointing that many of those on the other side of the aisle haven’t been willing to work on one. It’s an unfortunate trend that doesn’t serve our country.
At its most basic level, it’s the job of Congress and the administration to fund the federal government so it can function and support families and businesses across the country.
Short-term funding bills don’t provide certainty. They barely keep the government operating while our military, economy, families &amp; communities hang in limbo.
It will be the 4th time Congress has punted in 5 months. Congress has become equivalent to Groundhog Day – the same thing just keeps happening over and over every few weeks without a new result.
I will vote to keep the government open, but that is not an endorsement for a bill that just kicks the can down the road another few weeks.

I’ve been working to reinforce how critical trade and exporting are for our farmers, ranchers, &amp; other exporters for years now. Read an op-ed I wrote in @gfherald from last March: https://t.co/QVkaYcaggm
North Dakota’s #1 export to Canada &amp; Mexico is oil and gas, which makes protecting NAFTA critical to preserving jobs and economic growth in our state.
Of North Dakota’s exports, 95% of corn, 88% of beef, 86% of pork, and 100% of poultry go to Canada &amp; Mexico. https://t.co/7d38uKBqJa
North Dakota’s agriculture &amp; energy industries rely on exports to survive, but the administration hasn’t taken withdrawal from NAFTA off the table. Today I met w/ @USTradeRep to lay out my priorities to protect ND’s export economy: https://t.co/F6QZZSrVWs
The heartland needs more champions in Congress. That's why I'm excited to work with @SenTinaSmith as she joins me as a leader of the bipartisan Senate Rural Health Caucus. Together, we'll push for legislation to increase access to high-quality health care across rural America.
Important op-ed from 2 community bankers in ND on our bipartisan bill to provide needed regulatory relief for community banks. Esp. in these partisan times, our bill shows bipartisanship can exist &amp; create results that support rural communities. Read more: https://t.co/JKTqUa8HuR
I support #NetNeutrality &amp; the effort to overturn the FCC’s misguided decision. We must protect North Dakota consumers &amp; small businesses. https://t.co/HVXSMpWC8k
Introduced #SavannasAct in the Senate which is one step to help address the crisis of missing &amp; murdered Native women. I hope Congress passes it &amp; then continues to build on it so these crimes no longer go unnoticed outside Indian Country &amp; so we make sure Native women are safe.
Today I was on Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation where we brought together federal, state, local &amp; tribal law enforcement to hear stories from tribal members to show how pervasive these crimes are &amp; help address them. See @bistrib story: https://t.co/30WCJ1dK4w #NotInvisible
Almost everyone in Indian Country knows of a family struggling with or has a loved one of their own who is missing or murdered. If this was the case outside Indian Country, there would be a national call to action. Instead, these crimes remain hidden in the shadows.

Sat down with FDIC Chair nominee Jelena McWilliams to talk about the importance of local banks &amp; credit unions and how we need to help small businesses &amp; farms in rural America. She also accepted my invitation to come visit ND. https://t.co/spELLv4941
We’ve always known that North Dakota is one of the best places to raise a family in the nation. It was a privilege to watch my kids grow up in North Dakota, &amp; it’s great our state is being recognized nationally for its outstanding quality of life. https://t.co/Ura7YnTVkE
In ND we know hockey.  Disappointing 4 girls across our state that they don’t have a college women’s hockey team to look up to &amp; aspire to anymore. Hope ND’s girls keep playing hockey &amp; other sports &amp; know they matter just as much as the boys. See @nytimes https://t.co/HyHIIcFYKp
@inforum Check out some of the snapshots of my busy 2017. These photos are a reminder of why I come to work in the U.S. Senate every day fighting for ND. It’s a true honor to serve our state. https://t.co/Hxyihyvg4m
It's been quite a year. Read my op-ed @inforum about how despite the gridlock and partisanship in Congress, I’ve tried to get a lot done for ND by working across the aisle to reach results. That’s what North Dakotans rightfully expect. https://t.co/sXHWosXVNC
No family should have to worry their child will be able to get lifesaving medical treatment. Congress needs to reauthorize #CHIP immediately so families don’t have to make that choice. https://t.co/SyAmlA8fqG
Congrats to @AlabamaFTBL on their national championship, but @NDSUfootball has won 6 championships in the past 7 years. That seems like a real dynasty CC: @SenDougJones
North Dakota grows some wonderful things - wheat, soybeans, and national championship football teams. Yesterday, @SenJohnHoeven &amp; I introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate to recognize the @NDSUfootball team for their unprecedented success. #FCSChampionship #gobison https://t.co/HOVO7WTU0K

I've consistently raised concerns about the Republican tax bill's impact on rural America. Modest, temporary help for only some farmers while the wealthy &amp; corporations get permanent breaks isn't fair. A bipartisan process could have made a better bill. https://t.co/n6AfrsT8p2
As a member of the Senate Broadband Caucus I’ve been working to make sure expanding broadband access in rural America becomes a reality. I welcome the Administration's help to connect more rural communities w/ high-speed internet. https://t.co/K2EWPjdII8
The president also mentioned the opioid epidemic. I’ve held six listening sessions across North Dakota on opioid abuse, &amp; I’m continuing to push for more federal funds to combat this crisis – I hope the administration helps this effort. https://t.co/dovfwLVSFR
One of my top priorities is ensuring that the next Farm Bill helps our farmers, ranchers, &amp; honey bee producers cope w/ drought. I hope the administration supports a bipartisan bill that provides a strong safety net, promotes research, &amp; expands exports. https://t.co/abB8T4pJxn
I've been fighting to protect agriculture in trade negotiations &amp; have warned against withdrawal from NAFTA. Over 70% of ND’s ag exports go to NAFTA countries. Withdrawal would be a disaster for our rural economy. https://t.co/RQsMDHmMcq
Every day I come to work fighting for rural America. In his @FarmBureau speech, the president helped highlight many critical issues to rural communities like agriculture trade, opioid abuse, and access to high-speed internet. #AFBF18
Too often, Native American children are impacted by poverty, substance abuse, &amp; domestic violence. I got a bill passed into law to create a commission to address systemic issues affecting Native youth - &amp; it's now one step closer to getting to work. https://t.co/LPD4ruyduG

Best hockey game I watched at The Ralph: an exciting win against Omaha in February. #undproud #fightinghawks
Best laugh: Ate lunch at Country Kitchen in Casselton. Meal went long, so I called my next meeting at Valley City’s National Guard facility to let them know I’d be late. But they already knew – folks at the diner had given them a heads up. That's small town North Dakota for you!
Best place to get a @DietCoke: Any @McDonalds. Nothing beats fountain pop.
Best part of my job: Hearing from thousands of North Dakotans about their concerns and hopes for the future, &amp; fighting for them every day in the U.S. Senate. It’s a true honor.

Best movie I saw: Wind River. Brings valuable attention to the epidemic of violence against indigenous women as I’m fighting to pass my bill, Savanna’s Act, to help address this crisis. #NotInvisible
Reflecting on the things I loved in 2017 as we start a new year. Here’s my #Bestof2017 list, and I’d love to see yours!

Sadly, this bill leaves them behind. Read my full statement: https://t.co/FuCul5NXPL https://t.co/R82t4cG1No
Thanks @MSFTFargo – Congress needs to pass DREAM Act soon to protect those brought to US as children through no fault of their own. Over half were 6 yrs old or younger when arrived in US.

On the two year anniversary of this bipartisan deal—we should remember that when Rs and Ds  commit to debating and finding common ground, they can get things done. And that’s how I try to work every day in the Senate https://t.co/ytzUG3UmlU
The legislation was a way to both overturn the outdated ban and provide support for renewable energies, including wind energy jobs in ND. https://t.co/8T84njCt6n
In December 2015, I successfully helped craft and negotiate a bipartisan deal to lift the 40-year old ban on exporting U.S. crude oil. It was a major victory for ND and US consumers and producers.https://t.co/5g8i2A7L0W
Can Republicans and Democrats work together? A deal I helped craft two years ago shows that it’s not only possible, but also critical for supporting real economic growth and national security.
Congrats to @GoParks on 50 years of supporting and preserving our national parks. @TRooseveltNPS is one of ND’s greatest treasures w/ its rugged landscapes that helped to shape Teddy Roosevelt into becoming one of our most cherished presidents
@AARP I’ve long said I wanted to work on tax reform that supports workers, families, and retirees across North Dakota, but this bill was hastily crafted and pushed through by one party. That produced bad results that don’t serve North Dakota or rural America.
@AARP And provisions in this tax bill will do little to address the myriad of challenges young Americans face, from higher education and housing costs to a lack of retirement planning.
@AARP Millennials will face higher tax brackets because the Republican tax bill will permanently index tax brackets to a lower rate of inflation, resulting in more middle class income going into higher brackets over time.
@AARP By the time most millennials will be entering into their prime earning years, the tax cuts will be completely phased out.
@AARP Although millennials will be paying for these tax cuts, they won’t see much in terms of tax reductions because these cuts are geared toward higher earning workers who are more developed in their careers.
@AARP The Republican tax bill will hurt millennials. The structure of the tax bill will be particularly devastating for young men and women entering the workforce who will face a nearly $1.5 trillion bill in the next 10 years, just as they are entering their prime working years.
@AARP To pay for the huge cost of the bill, it could lead to $20 billion in cuts to vital agriculture programs and hinder the negotiation of the 2018 Farm Bill.
@AARP Republican tax bill will hurt rural America. Middle income families across rural America will lose out under bill in the long-term as the temporary, relatively modest tax decreases they receive will disappear after 2025 while the wealthy &amp; corporations will reap permanent rewards
@AARP The Republican tax bill will also drastically increase the nation’s debt by nearly $1.5 trillion, which could lead to $400 billion in cuts to Medicare over 10 years to help pay for the bill, and slash other programs that support seniors.
The Republican tax bill will hurt seniors. According to @AARP, the bill will provide a large tax cut for corporations while raising taxes &amp; health care premiums for millions of older Americans. https://t.co/e4tq8xEScS
The Republican tax bill will hurt small businesses. It will widen the gap between large and small businesses, &amp; essentially punish smaller businesses that can’t afford to pay high priced tax attorneys and accountants to exploit loopholes and glitches in the rules.
The Republican tax bill will hurt middle income families in the long-term. Read this 👇 https://t.co/Y0Qw7YCpvZ
The tax bill will have serious impacts on North Dakotans – middle income families, small business owners, seniors, millennials &amp; more. Here are some examples.
The Republican tax bill won’t grow the economy or create jobs in the way Republicans say it will, as many large companies have said they will pass most tax savings on to shareholders &amp; not use the majority of the tax cuts to create jobs or boost wages. https://t.co/ZOtWgMdgWv
Many academics &amp; experts have concluded that under the Republican tax bill, our country’s debt will grow much faster than the economy. https://t.co/DcYn3AUcxp
Republican tax bill provides permanent tax cuts to corporations &amp; large tax cuts for wealthy, while middle income families lose out in the long-term b/c the relatively modest tax cuts they initially receive will expire after 2025 &amp; they will see increased costs in the long run.
I supported tax cuts for middle income families. But we shouldn’t do it in a way that those families only receive relatively modest, temporary benefits, while the richest Americans – those making millions of dollars per year – and corporations receive the most benefits.
It’s Congress’ job to put US on a strong path forward. But the Republican tax bill will explode the country’s debt, adding nearly $1.5 trillion on the nation’s credit card – &amp; that’s before accounting for various budget gimmicks – forcing those huge costs onto future generations. https://t.co/I02unywXYZ

@FCC actions will ultimately undermine these safeguards. Going forward, I’ll monitor how internet service providers alter the way the internet is offered and work to find realistic solutions so that the internet can continue to thrive as an open and free platform for everyone.
Having strong net neutrality protections would have kept the internet on a level playing field to help allow start-up businesses to compete with large corporations and rural communities to access affordable internet service. It’s an issue of fairness.
@FCC Having high-speed internet is no longer a luxury, it’s a necessity. Each of us uses the internet daily to pay our bills, take online classes, and make routine purchases.
The decision by the @FCC to roll back net neutrality protections is extremely disappointing.

Spent some quality time last evening with @NDNationalGuard 188th Air Defense Artillery Regiment who are stationed to protect Washington, D.C. They deserve our thanks today and everyday https://t.co/axpPRpL46k
I’m proud of the bipartisan support this plan has received – and of the support it has from community banks &amp; credit unions in North Dakota, who would more easily be able to grant loans for a family to buy a home in a rural area, or a small business to expand &amp; create jobs.
Unlike tax reform, which was written behind closed doors with zero input allowed from Democrats, this bill is an example of how the process should work: negotiations between Rs and Ds, input from experts, &amp; public hearings and debates.
Today’s action came after more than 20 Committee hearings on regulatory reform &amp; economic growth since 2015. And we’ve received input from over 30 of the top financial regulators about the issue.
Today we saw a victory for bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate. After years of negotiations over several years with Republicans &amp; Democrats, the Banking Committee passed a bill I helped write to protect consumers &amp; encourage economic growth in rural communities.
This is how positive, lasting progress is made -- by putting partisan differences aside and working together to strengthen our economy &amp; protect consumers &amp; jobs. And @BPC_Bipartisan agrees: https://t.co/Mi3X9Stkig
This bill would improve access to mortgages in rural areas, strengthen protections for veterans &amp; renters facing foreclosure, &amp; improve access to credit for small businesses. And it’s gaining broad support from small lenders in North Dakota. https://t.co/7tUqlYitys
It’s not often you see such senators from both sides of the aisle coming together like this. But after years of work, we’ve written a plan that protects consumers &amp; reduces regulatory burdens on community banks &amp; credit unions, which are so important to rural economies.
This bill was negotiated and crafted over several years and it's an example of how if Rs &amp; Ds work in good faith to get results - as I try to do - Congres can reach bipartisan solutions.
Today I’m eager to take part in a hearing on a bipartisan bill I’ve helped put forward to protect consumers and promote growth in North Dakota’s rural communities.
