If U.S. not providing support to anti-Huthi effort we lose influence over how it’s conducted;

Huthi’s will see pulling support as weakness &amp; have less incentive for deal; &amp;

Huthi’s will increase attacks on ships &amp; Saudi civilians. Will escalate to broader &amp; deadlier conflict.
Pressuring for stronger response to #KhashoggiMurder right thing to do,but pulling support from Saudi’s on #Yemen wrong way to do it.

Pulling support will result in more civilian casualties,make peace less likely &amp; increase chance of broader regional war. https://t.co/4q4tmm66Hx

In short, Dem lawyers came to Florida to get judges to change Florida elections laws, AFTER the election. That isn’t a strategy to win an election, that is a strategy to steal an election. 4/4
#Florida law requires a manual recount of “undervotes” in close races &amp; provides a clear standard for determining whether a voter intended to vote for a candidate.

Now Dem lawyers want a judge to order Florida to ignore this intent standard when reviewing “undervotes” 3/4
For example, #Florida law requires that the voter signatures on mail ballots match the signature of the voter. 

But Dem lawyers are asking a judge to throw that law out &amp; force Florida to count ballots with signatures that don’t match the voter signature on file. 2/4
Imagine if NFL team was trailing 24-22 but in final seconds hits a 3 pt kick to win. Then AFTER game lawyers for losing team get a judge to order rules changed so that last second field goals are only 1 point

Deadline for recount is Thursday. #PalmBeach already said they won’t make it. #BrowardCounty just started recount today,3 days after most every other county &amp; will probably miss as well. Demanding they follow law isn’t effort to stop vote count,its effort to stop law breaking
Left wing commentators have no shame just making things up.

#BrowardCounty &amp; #PalmBeachCounty are headed towards being only counties to not make deadline for machine recount

Potentially deliberate effort to delay final count hoping a judge will order domestic vote by mail received after 7pm #ElectionDay counted, in violation of state law
Incompetent law breaking election officials lead to chance for lawyers to steal an election

Dem lawyers aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted. They’re here to get as many votes for their client as possible counted &amp; get as many votes for opponent as possible thrown out

They say claim of past misconduct by #BrowardCounty is unfounded even though ignoring years of local media coverage 2/3
Many of the same people in media &amp; commentary class who are always warning about “threats to our democracy” are excusing or deflecting attention from the blatant lawlessness in #Broward &amp; #PalmBeach undermining the credibility of &amp; public confidence in our elections 1/3
Want more lawlessness?

#BrowardCounty elections opened 208 provisional ballots without canvassing boards approval as required by law

After admitting error submitted them to board which found at least 12 are invalid

Guess what? They are going to count all 208 of them anyway
How can anyone defend this lawlessness?

How can anyone excuse #BrowardElections blanket refusal to reveal the number of ballots cast,counted &amp; left to be counted? Knowing how many ballots they have in their possession is one of the most important things they are required to keep track of.
If #BrowardElections has some legitimate reason for why they have been unable to tabulate &amp; report ballots they have had since Sunday night,like every other county did,they should disclose it. Instead they continue to operate under an indefensible shroud of secrecy. 4/4
2. In addition,they are required by state law to submit results every 45 minutes. The last update from them was over 20 hours ago.

3. Every ballot they receive has to be logged. Why have they consistently refused to disclose how many they have left to canvass &amp; count? 3/4
Conduct of #BrowardElections office is in blatant violation of state law. 

1. No early votes have been cast since Sunday. They had 2 days to tabulate them &amp; submit to state by 7:30pm Tuesday as required by law. Yet as of latest update these are still only partially completed 2/4 https://t.co/mmzJVZ6H5H
AFTERNOON UPDATE on #BrowardElections in the thread below:

Some partisans continue trying to portray what is happening in #BrowardCounty as normal &amp; criticism of it as effort to stop vote counting.

Fair question. 
 
No one is asking them to stop counting votes.

1. disclose how many ballots they have in their possession which still have to be canvassed &amp; tabulated; &amp; 

2. Submit tabulated ballots to Dept. of State every 45 minutes as required by law. https://t.co/ocMXlcgXIT
Not very comforting to #Florida voters that #BrowardCounty supervisor,in whose hands may rest outcome of Senate &amp; cabinet race has in the past:

3. Sent voters too many ballot pages
4. Left const question off ballot

Under #Florida law county must upload by 7 p.m. day BEFORE election ALL early votes canvassed &amp; tabulated by end of early voting &amp; report results within 30 minutes of polls close

Statewide results in #Florida &amp; across U.S. chance for self reflection by celebrities &amp; DC/NY media commentators. They think their views are a majority opinion. For 729 days their voices dominate. But every 2 yrs on 730th day voters make clear elite opinion isn’t majority opinion
Only 2 hrs left to vote in most of #Florida, 3 hrs in #Panhandle. The late surge of Democrat votes today is going to make this a VERY close election. @ScottforFlorida &amp; @RonDeSantisFL won’t win if you don’t vote. Get up,go to your voting site &amp; #StayInLine until you vote #Sayfie
As a Senator from #Florida I represent many Americans whose life started in another country. They came here because in their native country they could not do what we are doing here today, settling differences at the ballot box. We should all be thankful we have #ElectionDay2018.

Hatred stirs up disputes,but love covers all offenses. Proverbs 10:12
One of the most destructive aspects of “Anger Politics” is it uses the other sides outrageous rhetoric to justify or downplay the same behavior from your side. Just tonight someone went on national tv &amp; described  opposition to  “caravan” as a modern day Reichstag fire. Poison.

A nation whose most visible leaders &amp; institutions rely on anger to motivate people will eventually become a nation of very angry people. 

Anger can make good people take irresponsible &amp; destructive actions. But Anger will lead evil people to take horrifying &amp; tragic ones. 4/4
Great movements are always based on optimism &amp; inspiration. 

But optimism requires more patience than fear. 

An outrage based media focuses coverage on anger &amp; generally ignores inspiration.

And our culture rewards harsh rhetoric &amp; views measured words as weak or boring 3/4
History offers numerous examples of social &amp; political movements built primarily on tapping into &amp; stoking anger. To varying degrees they had some early success, but none of them ended well. 

And many of them caused great suffering &amp; tragedy on the way down. 2/4
Our core problem isn’t “Incendiary rhetoric” it’s the Anger it taps into &amp; stokes. 

Anger moves people to donate &amp; vote. And outrage is good for media ratings &amp; online traffic. 

Because anger is one of our most powerful emotions. But it is also one of our most destructive. 1/4
All bitterness, fury, anger, shouting, and reviling must be removed from you, along with all malice. Ephesians 4:31
While HATE is a sad feature of our fallen nature,tapping into ANGER for political gain is a choice. One both the left &amp; right now fully embrace. And while the politics of ANGER may not driven by HATE, those who do HATE can be driven to violence by the politics of ANGER.

All nations have divisions,but our republic requires compromise between divided groups. That’s not possible if we view those we disagree with as evil. We all claim we want compromise &amp; civility,but we have a culture,politics &amp; media fueled by outrage &amp; biased against compromise.

Yes words matter. Because freedom of speech allows us to air &amp; settle our disagreements &amp; grievances using words INSTEAD of violence.

Some already giving in to temptation to react to this terror attack by either assigning blame for or rationalizing it. No sane or well intentioned person,no matter how partisan,would do this. It’s either the work of a demented person or terror aimed at further dividing America.

We need to be firm on “caravan” but also smart. If we end training &amp; equipment to #Honduras &amp; #Guatemala,it will become easier to ship drugs here. And it will empower MS13 &amp; other dangerous gangs to continue to terrorize people,who will then eventually leave &amp; come illegally.
Our aid to #Honduras &amp; #Guatemala isn’t charity. It helps us more than them. By seizing drugs before they enter U.S. &amp;  kill Americans. And it’s border security because it helps fight the gangs that are terrorizing the people who ultimately wind up on our border.
I understand instinct to cut U.S. aid to punish countries for failing to stop illegal migration. But our aid to #Honduras &amp; #Guatemala isn’t cash. It’s primarily equipment &amp; training to stop drugs headed to U.S. &amp; to deal with the gangs causing people to leave those countries.
Saying you think they should all be allowed in &amp; processed is an open invitation for more “caravans”. This is not some authentic &amp; organic migration. This is a highly choreographed effort to challenge our immigration laws &amp; dare us to enforce them.
Lots of focus on what @potus said about cutting foreign aid &amp; fact checking whether terrorists are part of “caravan”. But little discussion about what should be done if they make it to our border. Every candidate for federal office in the midterms should be asked that question.
Today @Potus will sign the #WRDA bill. We still have lots of work ahead of us,but this was an important bipartisan achievement for #Florida &amp; #Everglades.  https://t.co/vSRSJO4tzu #Sayfie

While unlawful migration to U.S. from Central America is caused by real crisis,the migrant “caravan” was manufactured by supporters of a radical agenda who are using poor &amp; desperate people to try &amp; embarrass &amp; undermine the U.S. in the region. But it’s going to backfire on them.
The #KhashoggiMurder was immoral. But it was also disrepectful to Trump &amp; those of us who have supported the strategic alliance with the Saudi’s. Not only did they kill this man,they have left @potus &amp; their congressional allies a terrible predicament &amp; given Iran a free gift.

Below on this thread is the latest update on the Federal response to #HurricaneMichael. #Sayfie :
In #Michigan @JohnJamesMI is among the most impressive candidates in the country. The real opportunity in this campaign isn’t the partisan balance in the Senate, its the chance to elect someone who will be a leader in 21st  century American renewal. Please donate to his campaign. https://t.co/BGrqxiiH8o
“blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it.” Luke 11:28

Here is an afternoon update on the federal response to #HurricaneMichael in the thread below: #Sayfie
The full scale &amp; scope of #Michael will take weeks to determine. However we do know that you can’t survive a massive storm surge. Sadly, their is every reason to believe that the death toll from this hurricane is going to rise significantly in the hours &amp; days to come #Sayfie
“Cold-War”an outdated term. We allowed #China to cheat &amp; steal because hoped they would change. Instead they use strength gained to try &amp; surpass us. Not confronting this would be cataclysmic error &amp; define 21st century as era of U.S. &amp; democratic decline. https://t.co/VdFE1jr2Jj
Starting to see increasing coverage increase from @Verizon in the areas hit by #HurricaneMichael. Thank you for prompt response &amp; hard work. Also, @ATT whose coverage was less impacted has been donating phones to local government for use in recovery efforts. Thank you!! #Sayfie
Good news for #Florida in midst of many challenges. Congress authorized #LakeOkeechobee reservoir in record time because of bipartisan collaboration between federal,state &amp; local officials &amp; activists. A model for how to pursue rest of Everglades projects https://t.co/hKE2XteAGM
At our meeting yesterday morning @FEMA_Brock raised the need for Senate to confirm Peter Gaynor as Deputy Administrator for @fema whose nomination was stuck in limbo. Happy to report that less than 12 hours later he was confirmed by the Senate. #Sayfie
Normally power restoration workers remove trees &amp; debris blocking path before starting restoration. But @FLGovScott has authorized deployment of federal push crews to go in advance of utility crews &amp; clear paths so utilities can focus solely on getting power restored #Sayfie
Have been in contact with @verizon about cell coverage in area. They are hard at word to get coverage restored as soon as possible. I expect we will see steady improvement over the next 24 hours. #Sayfie
Spoke this morning to @HHSGov. They have set up two temporary medical units at Bay Medical &amp; Gulf Coast Regional. Will be able to offer basic first tier service until the local system is back up &amp; running. #Sayfie
Some asking if Congress will need to pass new funding for response. The answer is probably yes,but not for a few months. The unobligated balance of Disaster account is $30 billion. This of course will be reduced by ongoing costs of #Florence &amp; new costs from #Michael. #Sayfie

#Sayfie https://t.co/M8TlssFNPj
#MexicoBeach is total devastation. Tonight at the EOC I was able to view drone images that had just come in from this afternoon. Their were audible gasps in the room from officials who responded to some of the worst disasters in recent history. Images in thread to follow: #Sayfie
Restoring power going to be a long &amp; difficult task. The grid is shredded. Enormous number of crews on the scene &amp; more on the way. But it will take several days to assess damage,then trees will need to be removed before work begins. It’s the worst I’ve seen since Andrew #Sayfie https://t.co/sCYRKGu2nj
#PanamaCityFlorida has suffered catastrophic damage. Biggest immediate challenge is restoring phone service,primarily from the areas biggest carrier @Verizon. Have been in touch with them &amp; are hopeful service will be up again tonight #Sayfie
Just spent several hours with incredible first responders from Bay County &amp; across #Florida &amp; country. Many do not even know the condition of their own homes or loved ones,but are on the job around the clock. Thank You!
Update on conditions on the ground in this thread to follow:
The damage to the electric system in Bay County is extensive &amp; widespread. Restoration begins with removing downed lines &amp; rebuilding key components. It will not be easy or fast but the best restoration crews in the world are on the job &amp; will get this done. https://t.co/Y34rvDs97u
At junction of SR20 &amp; SR79 beginning to see signs of storm damage. But also signs of the work being done. A 7 truck caravan of power restoration vehicles headed into Panama City passed by just now. #Sayfie

Just met with @FEMA_Brock &amp; @Norad_Northcom at @fema office in DC to get an update on Federal efforts to assist #Florida after #hurricanemichael. Now on my way to #FloridaPanhandle #EmeraldCoast to meet with local officials.  #Sayfie https://t.co/prlzVmyvIB
Fed response to Hurricane underway. Focused first on stabilizing 8 critical lifelines:

1. Safety &amp; Security

2. Food,Water&amp;Shelter

3. Healthcare 

4. Power &amp; Fuel

6. Telecommunications

7. Transportation: roads blocked,bridges need inspection

8. Hazardous Waste

#Sayfie
It will take a long time to recover from this. We will do everything we can to make sure the federal government does it’s part. But I will confess that my biggest fear that this part of #Florida, with its unique &amp; genuine characteristics, will never be the same.  #Sayfie
Highway 98 which connects communities along the coast was washed out at several points. Will complicate efforts to get assistance to several impacted communities. #Sayfie
Mexico Beach is an old old #Florida town. It’s charm is that it feels like a trip back in time to a place unspoiled by development. I was told this morning that is is “gone”. #Sayfie
Panama City is a vibrant seaside city. Popular vacation spot for both families &amp; college students. Early reports from locals is catastrophic devastation. As it was described to me, the electric grid won’t need to be restored, it will need to be rebuilt. #Sayfie
#Florida primer on this thread just so those outside state understand a little bit about NW part of the state. It is a place we fell in love with as a family years ago &amp; have spent many long weekends enjoying #Sayfie:
As the sun rises on NW #Florida the early reports I am getting on damage is stunning. I have not yet seen it myself but local leaders are telling me that the damage in Panama City is catastrophic. And one said “Mexico Beach is gone”. #Sayfie

Additional updates on Federal response below in this thread. #Sayfie
Short segway from #HurricaneMichael news to another item of interest. Today,we sent a bipartisan letter to the Trump admin triggering an investigation &amp; Global Magnitsky sanctions determination on the disappearance of Saudi journalist &amp; @washingtonpost columnist #JamalKhashoggi.
Good question. We didn’t bypass #Florida Attorney General. A.G. Pam Bondi has jurisdiction over violations of state law. The U.S. Justice Department would investigate violations of federal law. https://t.co/MboUxr5dry

Even by todays low standards the baseless speculation from some journalists about potential reasons why @nikkihaley is resigning is stunning. Her predecessors served an average of a little over 2 years but lets make something up anyway. Ridiculous.
Tonight the Senate ended voted to end debate on the water bill #WRDA. It will pass tomorrow &amp; then go to the President for his signature. This is good news for #Florida which has been dealing with the twin catastrophes of toxic #AlgaeBloom &amp; #RedTide. #Sayfie
Just spoke with the Director of Natl #Hurricane Center. If you or someone you love live(s) in the #FloridaPanhandle #BigBend or #NatureCoast of #Florida please evacuate if you are in an evacuation area. #HurricaneMichael is going to bring storm surge that can’t be survived https://t.co/mD7CXmtJKn
Meanwhile,eclipsed by the conflict &amp; anger over SCOTUS fight is the fact that last week @amyklobuchar &amp; I passed our bipartisan bill that will stop the exploitation of addicted Americans by patient brokers. Read about it here: https://t.co/gq7M2vh8cJ
If the primary funder of “protests” &amp; disruptions like those we saw last week was named Koch instead of Soros,would so many in media still pretend it was an organic movement of everyday citizens or would they expose it as the work of a well funded network? https://t.co/N8zxSFRrN5
Embedded in article is common refrain from Asia “experts” that con­fronting #China is wrong approach. I suppose right approach is to not mention Muslims they detained in camps? The abduction of head of Interpol?The massive theft of intellectual property?   https://t.co/Pv0JWYPENO
Let me summarize this opinion piece in NYT. It denounces the alleged reliance on conspiracy theories &amp; paranoia by the GOP by.... spreading a conspiracy theory based on paranoia about the GOP.  https://t.co/UettwRx5Rb

Today is the last day to get ready in the #FloridaPanhandle. You should be wrapping up Hurricane preparations &amp; getting settled to ride out the storm tomorrow. Conditions will deteriorate later today so you only have a few hours left. @Sayfie

For although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened. While claiming to be wise, they became fools.  Romans 1:21-22

I’m as pleased as anyone that we successfully confirmed a conservative to the court. And I too want to keep the GOP majority. But in the long run we all lose if tribalism permanently disfigures America &amp; leaves us a nation of people who hate each other. https://t.co/pc5nJlr4Xv
Imagine the coverage on cable news if an angry mob of conservatives stormed the steps of the Supreme Court building. It wouldn’t be the breathless giddiness we are seeing right now. It wouldn’t be awe at the bravery of someone climbing up on the statue of Lady Liberty.
Can you imagine what democrats &amp; many in media would be saying if it was conservatives ambushing them at restaurants,confronting them at home,disrupting Senate hearings &amp; vote with primal screams &amp; now literally banging on door of Supreme Court building? They would call it a mob.
One of the most ridiculous observations I have heard in media today is how close this vote was. It was going to be close even if these allegations had never emerged. Senate Democrats were going to reflexively &amp; immediately oppose any of the names on Trump list.
SCOTUS vote was about a specific nominee facing specific &amp; ultimately uncorroborated allegations. Some now gloating about how its going to help win elections. Others stir rage &amp; now tears from victims by portraying it as referendum on sexual violence. Just terrible for America.
I’ve seen FBI “report” too:
1. Interviewed ALL those named as present at gathering where alleged assaulted occurred:
2. Not one could recall any such gathering much less an assault:
3. After over 150 interviews no one has ever told FBI that Kavanaugh drugged or assaulted anyone; https://t.co/6wk88zqiW2
Most will never know the full extent of the efforts to intimidate &amp; threaten @SenatorCollins on the #Kavanaugh vote. I am not talking about political pressure or people screaming at her in an elevator. I am talking about vicious, vile &amp; dangerous actions. She is legit. https://t.co/XVYQ4pDvg6
The founders created the Senate to protect our broader national interests against mass sentiment &amp; momentary passions. That kind of Senate is no more. Instead of protecting us from a mass sentiment of anger &amp; tribalism, the modern Senate has become its most powerful showcase.
I don’t just know @SenatorCollins from tv,I know her in real life. No Senator works harder to arrive at the right decision. Sometimes we don’t agree,but I know her decision on difficult questions is based on research &amp; strongly held principles. Her speech today is vintage Collins https://t.co/XVYQ4pDvg6
My Kavanaugh vote based on facts we have about specific allegations in this specific case.  After 7 background checks with over 150 people interviewed over 2 decades by FBI &amp; not one of them has knowledge of him sexually assaulting anyone. My speech here: https://t.co/8d4CPcGTRH
LORD,you have probed me,you know me:you know when I sit &amp; stand;you understand my thoughts from afar. You sift through my travels &amp; my rest;with all my ways you are familiar. Even before a word is on my tongue, LORD, you know it all. Psalms 139:1-4
#RedTide confirmed in #MiamiDade. Some beaches now closed. This is a statewide crisis for #Florida. Red Tide has been around for centuries but never like this. Will keep fighting for $ for research &amp; for passage of WRDA bill next week in Senate. #Sayfie

The bill we passed yesterday is a big win for South #Florida &amp; recovering addicts &amp; bad news for corrupt sober homes. We still need to do more, but this was very important. Expect the President to sign it very soon. #Sayfie  https://t.co/wusGMwRg3y
To date,the named witnesses deny knowledge of Dr. Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh &amp; no independent corroboration of allegations has emerged. This morning I will review new FBI report. If it provides no corroborating evidence I will vote to confirm #Kavanaugh tomorrow.
But you who say, “How shall we persecute him,
seeing that the root of the matter is found in him?” Be afraid of the sword for yourselves, for your anger is a crime deserving the sword;that you may know that there is a judgment. Job 19: 28-29
Our new law which goes after the patient brokering causing #Florida’ #SoberHomes crisis has passed &amp; is now on it’s way for the President to sign into law.  Thanks to the #PalmBeach Heroin &amp; Sober Homes Task Force &amp; @aronberg for all your help. #Sayfie https://t.co/cttscX3zyQ
Tomorrow, as part of the Opioid bill, we will pass &amp; send to POTUS our bill to prohibit kick-backs by #SoberHomes. We worked with @aronberg &amp; other local leaders in South #Florida on this &amp; are grateful to them for their input &amp; advocacy. #Sayfie
Today we passed &amp; sent to POTUS our Post-Disaster Fairness to States Act as part of FAA bill. It places a 3 year statute of limitation on @fema clawing back funds after completion of projects following disasters.  This is very important for local governments in #Florida. #Sayfie
These deals aren’t just about money. The 21st Century will be driven by big data. Whoever controls big data will control the important industries &amp; innovations. That is why you see #China companies pursue these deal. They want to own big data on Americans https://t.co/8NArmrtUcJ
More at stake in #IranDeal than just #Iran. #Putin is working hard to get #EU &amp; others to help Iran circumvent U.S. sanctions because if successful it would create a precedent &amp; a roadmap for #Russia to evade sanctions in the future.
Trade dispute is having a very negative impact on public confidence in economy of #China. Expect them to make moves soon to stabilize renmibi,allow wholly owned subsidiaries in more industries &amp; provide unemployment benefits for workers who lost their jobs due to trade dispute.
This article is wrong in claiming that the selection of new Iraqi PM &amp; President leaves no clear winner between #Iran &amp; U.S.. The clear winner is Iran. IRGC leader Soleimani personally brokered this deal. This is a major &amp; troubling development. https://t.co/2zJV7EKjOv
#NorthKorea goal is getting sanctions removed. To achieve this they are working on 2 things:
1. Driving wedge between U.S. &amp; S.Korea;
2. Force U.S. to accept step by step process where every one of their “concessions” met with a reciprocal sanction removed https://t.co/uAfweFZudB

Be still before the LORD; wait for him. Do not be provoked by the prosperous,nor by malicious schemers. Refrain from anger;abandon wrath;do not be provoked;it brings only harm. Those who do evil will be cut off,but those who wait for the LORD will inherit the earth. Psalm 37:7-9
“The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away;
blessed be the name of the LORD!”  In all this Job did not sin nor did he charge God with wrong. Job 1: 21-22
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna,* into the unquenchable fire. Mark 9:43
This could have happened weeks ago without violating Dr. Ford’s request for confidentiality if her claims had been handled appropriately instead of leaked to press. And Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly stated yesterday he would support whatever additional inquiry committee decided on
An @FBI interview of those mentioned by Dr. Ford as being at the scene of the alleged attack is prudent. The more information we have the better.

Anyone claiming harassment or assault should be taken seriously &amp; be heard.

Today we passed the #NicaAct out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Very strong bipartisan support for punishing those responsible for the #Ortega regimes abuses in #Nicaragua.

We should ALL,the Dems,the GOP,the media,admit our role in turning politics into theatre. Being outrageous equals clicks,viewers &amp; therefore ratings &amp; $ for media &amp; fame for politicians. Being normal gets you ignored &amp; a primary challenger for being “too weak”.
Barack Obama at a speech at American University accused those who opposed #IranDeal of making common cause with those in Iran who chant “Death to America”.
Barack Obama in a Univision interview calling on Hispanics to vote against GOP “enemies”: “If Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, ‘We’re gonna punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us...”
Barack Obama justifying ignoring constitution limits on the power of President: “Middle-class families can’t wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff. So sue me.”
Barack Obama on people left behind by new economy: “And it’s not surprising then they get bitter,they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.”

4. Call the GOP the enemy of Hispanics

Me uní al @SenCoryGardner en una enmienda para terminar con la ayuda extranjera a #ElSalvador después de que su gobierno de izquierda decidiera abandonar a #Taiwán en favor de #China. También hablé con @realdonaldtrump hace unos minutos sobre recortarles la ayuda.
I have joined @SenCoryGardner in an amendment to end foreign aid to #ElSalvador after their leftist government decided to abandon #Taiwan in favor of #China. I also spoke to @realdonaldtrump about cutting off their aid just a few minutes ago.
Maduro is increasingly a national security threat. The mass migration he has caused is destabilizing neighbors including #Colombia, #Brazil &amp; #Ecuador. Do not be surprised if he invites #Russia Air Force to send bomber on visit &amp; even open up a #Putin base in #Venezuela
As expected @NicolasMaduro using drone attack that caused his soldiers to run away scared to justify dictatorship. Making people even more dependant on regime for little they have &amp; opponents inside regime fear he will fabricate evidence implicating them in attack.  #Venezuela

If Ortega-Murillo regime in #Nicaragua gets a big loan from #Russia to bail them out of crisis they created, it will confirm what I have been arguing for some time, Ortega is #Putin closest supporter in Latin America &amp; therefore a national security risk to U.S. we must address.
The U.S. response to #Panama &amp; #DominicanRepublic switching from #Taiwan to #China is NOT the way we will react if #ElSalvador does the same. If they do this I will have no choice but to immediately begin work to end their funding &amp; remove them from #AllianceForProsperity plan.
Would be terrible mistake for govt of #ElSalvador to switch diplomatic recognition from #Taiwan to #China. Maybe they think China $ will help governing party win elections in 2019. But will cause real harm to relationship with U.S. including their role in #AllianceforProsperity

After Ortega/Murillo reign of terror their is no future for them in power. Strong U.S. reaction is coming. They will pay big price for their crimes against their own people. I strongly advise #Nicaragua military not to participate in oppressing the people. https://t.co/rwGupFKfJb
the mount of the LORD’s house shall be established as the highest mountain;...&amp; Many nations shall come &amp; say “Come, let us climb the LORD’s mountain to the house of the God of Jacob,That he may instruct us in his ways, that we may walk in his paths” Micah 4:1-2
It’s not schools fault that an accused #Russia spy spoke at @USouthFlorida St. Petersburg world affairs conference. If she had told them who she really was &amp; what she was up to she wouldn’t be a spy. Concealing their intentions is what spies literally do. https://t.co/PJaTyrQy1k
I gave a speech about this yesterday at @Heritage. Read about concerns that “deep fake” technology will be utilized to blackmail U.S. troops with phony audio &amp; video. Need to pay more attention to this now before it happens not wait to react after it does: https://t.co/SkHS0hvcps
Xi Jinping has no “intention of following through” on discussions held this year between the two countries &amp; has “not responded at all” to U.S. demands to stop stealing American trade secrets. So lets allow #ZTE to stay in business and keep stealing??????? https://t.co/IVcEHhszZ9
Arguing we shouldn’t ban #ZTE because then all the business will go to another #China spy company #Huawei isn’t a  reason to let ZTE stay,its a reason to go after Huawei as well. But if we aren’t willing to take on #ZTE we will never take on a much larger company like Huawei.
The #ZTECave endangers passage of an important &amp; good bill &amp; every argument for caving is weak. A sanctions compliance official on the board won’t stop backdoor access to routers. A big fine is small price to pay compared to value of info they will steal. https://t.co/SalNbc6Mxd
Given the specific details many of my Senate colleagues know about #ZTE &amp; how #China intends to use them against the U.S.,  I am surprised they caved so easily in conference.
Our bipartisan #DETERAct with @ChrisVanHollen -which would automatically impose crippling sanctions on #Russia if #Putin interferes in our elections again- is gaining momentum. We added another 4 Democrat &amp; 4 GOP cosponsors yesterday. More on the way.  https://t.co/WcveiUCTPt
This is textbook example of #Putin playing “Divide &amp; Conquer.” Yesterday he alluded to“useful agreements” reached in #Helsinki &amp; that now U.S. jobs &amp; European &amp; Middle Eastern security hang in the balance if U.S. opponents try to block these “agreements.”  https://t.co/drW5p3sWRL
Every valley shall be lifted up,
every mountain and hill made low;

This deal on #CFIUS is good news. The bad news? They had to cave on #ZTE in order to get it. So chances that a #China controlled telecomm will not just stay in business, but do so here inside the U.S. sadly just went up. #BadTradeoff  https://t.co/Bjew7KLaex
Today I spoke @Heritage about how foreign adversary such as #Putin #Russia could further weaponize information against us, using #DeepFakes to threaten our democracy &amp; national security. Watch Here:  https://t.co/D42xrJxFEB
Why does @CommerceGov allow #ZTE stay in business? Why would some on conference committee cave on ZTE &amp; settle for CFIUS reform only? ZTE is part of broader pattern of sanctions violations &amp; illicit deals by firms with ties to #China’s military. https://t.co/MsXlL6MEJx
While is &amp; remains a very serious threat. But #China is even more of a danger. They are quietly building an army of influence agents in the U.S. by turning Americans against our countries interests &amp; in favor of China’s.  https://t.co/Ee36FxJwAa via @thedailybeast
The Ortega/Murillo human rights abuses,murders &amp; kidnappings continue in #Nicaragua. Now real consequences must follow. I will be pushing for Global Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible &amp; direct financial sanctions against any military leader who participates in these crimes.
Reminder of what I said almost 4 months ago. #Florida is a VERY attractive target for election chaos effort. Not because officials are doing something wrong but because of our importance in national politics. We need to take this very seriously. https://t.co/PiIlUH65bW #sayfie https://t.co/o7clxyqSit
Under no circumstances should #Putin officials ever be allowed to come into the U.S. &amp; “question” Americans on their list. I don’t believe this will ever be allowed to happen which is why the ⁦@WhiteHouse⁩ should publicly &amp; unequivocally rule it out. https://t.co/bLDGJsSodi

While we let #ZTE stay in business even as they break our laws &amp; spy on us, this is the kind of hardball #China plays. They have forced an airline to close down because the companies home country has diplomatic ties with #Taiwan https://t.co/zNYR5uZw4Z
#China is aggressively targeting &amp; threatening American companies with punishment unless they agree to pretend that #Taiwan doesn’t exist. The issues with #Russia are very bad. But the long-term threats from China are ten times worse. https://t.co/utyBHm5b5P

The wicked, when spared, do not learn justice; in an upright land they act perversely &amp; do not see the majesty of the LORD. LORD, your hand is raised high,but they do not perceive it; Let them be put to shame when they see your zeal for your people. Isaiah: 26:10-11
Overall a good day for #DETERAct. Some challenges emerged but support is growing. We have to get this done because the only way to even have a chance at keeping #Putin from interfering in our future elections is to make the price of hostilities higher than the benefit from it.
Also spoke on @AmericaNewsroom  about why abolishing @ICEgov is a stupid, radical &amp; irresponsible idea. ICE enforces immigration law,they don’t make it. And they do more than just immigration,they go after traffickers &amp; gangs who are in the country illegally. https://t.co/EgG8Uvo6nV
Was on @AmericaNewsroom this morning talking about our #DETERAct &amp; the need to make sure #Putin understands we will not overlook his hostilities &amp; he will face punishing consequences if he does it again. https://t.co/6VTmyEMv2A
Last night #Alabama #GOP made a great choice by electing a great conservative &amp; my friend @WillAinsworthAL as their nominee for Lieutenant Governor. Now its on to victory in November! https://t.co/DLKLDwbagi
Making sure that the benefits of our booming economy reaches the American worker must become one of the primary goals of our domestic agenda. And it’s not just about money. America can’t truly be strong if we don’t restore &amp; protect the dignity of work. https://t.co/YszVH0y4v0
Requiring ⁦@SecretService⁩ or other agency to protect presidential candidates digitally in addition to physically is very interesting idea. Will be looking into this asap. Makes sense given what we know about 2016 &amp; what we expect in the future. https://t.co/X16shtw1Ox
Let Mueller continue &amp; finish his probe &amp; we on Senate Intel are on track to finish ours. But the most meaningful measure we can take is to pass bipartisan #DETERAct which imposes specific &amp; serious sanctions if #Putin interferes in our elections again.  https://t.co/Nlcusak4fx
I know for a fact #Putin interfered in 2016 &amp; we should punish it. But while we can’t change the past we can influence the future. So let’s pass the #DeterAct to try &amp; prevent Putin interference in 2018 &amp; beyond.
The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD,
and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD. Isaiah 11:2-3
Nueva ola de ataques por parte de las pandillas paramilitares de #OrtegaMurillo en #Monimbo #Masaya. Ahora vienen las consecuencias para Ortega y Murillo por esta delincuencia. #SOSNicaragua
Images from earlier this morning of what sources inside #Nicaragua describe as blue shirted #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gang preparing to attack. https://t.co/GZUAl6HSbw
At this moment the parish church of Mary Magdalene in #Monimbó #Nicaragua is being targeted by #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gang. At least one priest is trapped inside.
Receiving reports from inside #Nicaragua of a new wave of violent attacks by #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gangs in  #Monimbo #Masaya. The situation is rapidly deteriorating.
#Helsinki &amp; subsequent reaction showed #Putin achieved goals of interference:
1. Weaken next President with nagging &amp; persistent allegations;
2. Weaken public confidence in our political parties,media &amp; govt agencies; &amp;
3. Weaken U.S. by inflaming partisan &amp; cultural divisions
Scoundrels, villains, are they who deal in crooked talk. Shifty of eye,feet ever moving,pointing with fingers,They have perversity in their hearts,always plotting evil,sowing discord. Therefore their doom comes suddenly;in an instant they are crushed beyond cure. Proverbs 6:12-19
#Putin’s interference in 2016 didn’t elect Trump &amp; it doesn’t mean we don’t deal with him on other issues. But we can’t afford to forget he always exploits weakness. If we don’t acknowledge &amp; punish what he did,his next attack on us will be bolder,more brazen &amp; far more damaging.
Foreign policy must be based on reality,not hyperbole or wishful thinking. And the reality is #Russia is an adversary. Because #Putin doesn’t believe in win/win scenarios &amp; thinks only way to make Russia stronger is to make U.S. weaker. Any approach not based on this will fail.
Been making this point for 5 years now. Economic growth doesn’t distribute through economy the way it once did. The rising tide of a booming economy doesn’t necessarily lift all ships anymore. Why I pushed for #ChildTaxCredit &amp; now #PaidFamilyLeave  https://t.co/qZzKXulGG5
Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the LORD speaks: Sons have I raised and reared, but they have rebelled against me! Isaiah 1:2
I will listen for what God, the LORD, has to say;
surely he will speak of peace to his people and to his faithful. May they not turn to foolishness! Psalms 85:9
Several wks ago I personally told #Nicaragua F.M. Denis Moncada Colindres that opportunity still existed to avoid cycle of conflict with U.S. if they held early &amp; fair elections. But Ortega/Murillo regime responded with more violence making very clear the path they have chosen
Watch LIVE the developing situation in #Nicaragua via 100 NOTICIAS NICARAGUA https://t.co/NV3po0caHQ via @YouTube We are awaiting the promised release of the students, journalists &amp; clergy trapped inside church by armed Ortega gang. We know of at least one fatality inside.
These are the bullets these Ortega paramilitary criminal gangs are using &amp; this is the consequence. An unarmed student shot in the head overnight, taken into church by fellow students who could not ambulances in to rescue him, &amp; he died this morning. 4/4 https://t.co/0PS0E0pBgU
This ongoing attack &amp; siege is being conducted by paramilitary gangs which are armed &amp; controlled by Ortega &amp; his wife/VP Rosario Murillo. They will be held directly &amp; personally responsible for those who have already died or been wounded &amp; any others who die or are wounded. 3/4 https://t.co/z0u35b7WHU
Outside church &amp; Non-Govt leaders are pleading &amp; praying to be allowed access to tend to the injured &amp; release those trapped inside. But apparently Ortega government intends to kill those students &amp; journalists remaining. 2/4 https://t.co/bqttWrhpkx
Ortega paramilitary gangs continue to fire on Divine Mercy Church in #Nicaragua where journalist, student &amp; clergy remain trapped. Ambulances are outside ready to assist but Ortega gangs will not allow them in.  1/4 https://t.co/2s7S24q4Ld
Those who are wise in their own eyes,prudent in their own view!.. who acquit the guilty for bribes &amp; deprive the innocent of justice!..their root shall rot..;..For they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of hosts &amp; scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel. Is 5:21,23-24
When these “Opportunity Zone” projects end up transforming long forgotten communities across America their will be one person who will deserve most of the credit for making this possible &amp; that is ⁦@SenatorTimScott⁩   https://t.co/f38t7ClRWC
Ambulances must be allowed to enter church immediately &amp; remove the wounded before someone loses their life. If anyone dies because of this deliberate delay by the regime,Ortega &amp; his wife will be held personally responsible. The ambulances are outside building,let them in now https://t.co/7T9c6HKWmA
Despite my frequent disagreement with the way some in media cover our politics,tonight we got a powerful reminder of why press freedom is worth protecting. @partlowj from @WaPo was interviewing student protestors in #Nicaragua when Ortega regime attacked university. https://t.co/D1uzwZ1EVK
After their paramilitary gang attacked church &amp; natl univ #UNAN tonight the Ortega regime must immediately end the attack,allow the injured to be taken to hospital, release U.S. journalist @partlowj immediately from &amp; allow everyone else to leave as soon as possible #Nicaragua
Divine Mercy parish church in #Nicaragua under attack by Ortega paramilitary gang. Serious injuries but Ortega not allowing medical personnel to enter. This is part of coordinated simultaneous attacks tonight by these gangs in several places including the National Univ #UNAN https://t.co/Spd62TVw19
Continuing to confirm other reports receiving tonight from inside #Nicaragua. In addition, independent media outlets have been forced off the air &amp; only government version of events is being broadcast inside country right now. https://t.co/GysIhy1Iy9
Also the neighborhood where many U.S. embassy employees live is under attack. That is not a coincidence. Ortega, his wife (who is also the VP of #Nicaragua) &amp; those empowering him will be held directly responsible if any hard should come to any U.S. personnel or their families
U.S. journalist for @WAPO @partlowj is trapped inside a church under siege by Ortega thugs. Reports serious injuries but Ortega forces not allowing ambulances to enter &amp; render aid. https://t.co/D1uzwZ1EVK
At this moment Ortega thugs are setting fire to #UNAN the national university of #Nicaragua trying to either smoke out student protestors or be burned alive. Have been informed a Jesuit priest &amp; a U.S. journalist from a major outlet are among those trapped inside.
A few hours ago Ortega ordered Paramilitary gangs &amp; security forces to attack #UNAN students &amp; a catholic church. Reports &amp; video coming in of severe injuries &amp; fatalities. Also reports that several non-regime controlled media outlets have been taken off the air. #NicaraguaSOS https://t.co/UOSgVLz0Ct
Situation tonight in #Nicaragua is rapidly &amp; dangerously escalating. Ortega &amp; those in his govt are on notice that if any harm comes to U.S. personnel or their families he will personally face severe repercussions &amp; if his violence leads to a bloodbath he will face consequences
3rd, #Putin will do this again &amp; it will be even more difficult to stop. Changing voter registration data,strategically timed deep fakes, targeting congressional enemies &amp; races with outsized national influence, these are just some of the things we could see in 2018 or 2020. 4/4
Second,the most influential yet unwitting collaborators of the Putin effort was the media which extensively covered every salicious detail of the leaks, but spent little time looking into who was behind the hacking &amp; their motivation. 3/4
While Putin may have developed a preference for Trump that wasn’t his primary objective &amp; that isn’t why he won. His goal was to exacerbate our political divisions &amp; get us to fight each other even more. Something we already do a pretty good job of ourselves without his help 2/4
I dont “believe” Putin interfered in our elections I know for a fact he did. But some important nuances are being completely ignored in the analysis, coverage &amp; partisan reaction to todays indictments. 1/4

Spoke about this yesterday. https://t.co/2zLEG5y0MM #Putin does not seek “better relations” with U.S. he seeks an equality with U.S. he believes is only possible if America grows weaker &amp; Russia stronger. For him our relationship is a competition that can only have one winner 5/5
Nearly impossible to truly “partner” with #Putin because he views geopolitics as zero sum competition &amp; the world as place where the strong prey on the weak. That’s why he seeks to make Russia a great power equal to U.S. &amp; why his true interest is gaining an advantage.  4/5
#Putin is always looking to exploit what he perceives as vulnerabilities of foreign counterparts. He will weaponize their personal information while carefully guarding his own. He will try to make counterparts appear anxious or indecisive &amp; himself as unemotional &amp; in control 3/5
#Putin views &amp; personality formed growing up in the Soviet society. No leader can have a good relationship with him because he trusts no one. And partnering with him is difficult because he views geopolitics as a zero-sum competition in which the strong prey on the weak. 2/5
No one has been a harsher critic of #Putin than I have been. No one. But with 90% of the worlds nukes controlled by #Russia &amp; U.S. we have no choice but to meet with him. That said, we should clearly know who Putin is &amp; what he wants. 1/5 https://t.co/2KWovmTlgA via @WSJOpinion

It’s hard to balance our laws &amp; our values (as the nasty comments which will soon follow will no doubt prove). But we must do it. Because open borders is wrong. And so is dehumanizing people, the vast majority of whom are fleeing threats to their families from gangs &amp; violence

In many ways America is stronger than ever. But our shared national identity is in trouble. The erosion of non-political ties to one another has increasingly left us with politics as the primary source of our individual identity &amp; as the primary influence in how we view others.

Actually more like 2 screaming people who apparently support a release policy that encourges already vulnerable migrants to bring children with them on dangerous journey to unlawfully cross U.S. border.

Won’t be easy to house families together,but we must do it. Because we can never again go back to policy of either separating families or releasing everyone. Yes,separating families is cruel. But so is release policy that incentivizes adults to unlawfully cross border with kids https://t.co/AkJHctj4to
Should pass bill we filed asap. It creates capacity to hold families together,sets standards for family detention,hires judges to speed up their hearing process,but also ends the release policy that enticed parents to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter U.S.
Visited Homestead shelter for migrant children. We must make sure they are safe &amp; cared for &amp; held together with parents as soon as possible. But we MUST also end the cruel policies which incentivize parents to bring kids here on such a dangerous journey. https://t.co/rr3jH2N2Uu

We are AMERICA which means no matter the legality of their entry we MUST meet a higher standard in our treatment of vulnerable migrants,especially children. But we MUST also end the policies incentivizing adults to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter the U.S.

Earlier today I spoke on the Senate Floor about our immigration issues and the need for Congress to act if we want to enforce the law &amp; also keep families together. Watch here: https://t.co/RlY78TZiAO
I support a generous immigration system. I support responsibly accommodating those who came years ago as children &amp; those who have been here a long time. But a policy which basically says if you unlawfully enter with children you will likely get to stay forever is irresponsible
Based on Senate speeches Democrat position is: Don’t detain children; Don’t detain their parents either so we don’t separate families &amp;; Don’t deport them if they fail to appear for subsequent hearing. So basically if you enter unlawfully with children we won’t enforce the law?
Great news! The world is waking up to the #China threat. #Britain just held up a China aerospace deal over national security. This is why instead of a trade fight with Europe we should have teamed up with them to confront China together. #TheftTax  https://t.co/dbCaz9XDfq

Just heard Senate colleague on floor say U.S. detains immigrant children “indefinitely &amp; indiscriminately”. That is just PATENTLY FALSE. They are entitled to due process hearing so not indefinite. And only applies to those who enter U.S. unlawfully so its not indiscriminate.
Some Democrats now even using the disingenuous “indefinite detention” term. They know full well that those who unlawfully enter the U.S. are not held indefinitely. They are entitled to a due process hearing &amp; our new bill hires more judges to speed up that process.
The ink isn’t even dry on the new executive order ending separation policy &amp; some Democrats already arguing that keeping families together isn’t enough. Now they want them &amp; their parents released after unlawful entry knowing full well that high % will never appear for hearing
It is cruel to separate families. But it’s also cruel &amp; irresponsible to return to policy that encourages bringing children on a very dangerous journey. Our bill will change the law so families will remain together while awaiting prioritized proceedings.  https://t.co/e1nTp60q4p
Bill was just filed led by @SenThomTillis &amp; many others like @SenatorFischer The executive order today does NOT take away the need for Congress to act. We need to get rid of the “Flores Settlement” or a court ruling could lead to same problem again. https://t.co/yvun8XyMcy

Returning to a policy that only adults with children are released would create an incentive to bring kids. Yes separating families is cruel,but so is a policy that encourages parents to bring their kids on a dangerous journey. Instead lets #DetainandMaintain families together

If every Senator is willing to support it by unanimous consent, the Senate could pass a bill, before the end of the week, that would allow families charged with illegal entry to be kept together while awaiting an expedited hearing. I truly hope that is what we do.
Led by @JohnCornyn a group of us are finalizing bill that will allow families to be held together pending expedited hearing. We can &amp; must avoid BOTH creating incentive to unlawfully enter with children AND separating children from their parents https://t.co/Cxrieul3tk
Releasing those who unlawfully enter b/c they came with children creates a cruel incentive to bring children on dangerous journey. Detaining parents is cruel because it separates families. Lets change the law so we can hold families together while awaiting expedited hearings

I strongly support the great Americans at @FBI⁩ but the conduct of the senior officials outlined in this report has done tremendous damage to the bureau. Leaks to &amp; gifts from reporters. Agents talking about how they are going to stop Trump from winning https://t.co/tQX3dnpLtq
CFIUS is process used to potentially block attempts by foreign companies to do deals which pose a threat to our national security. Giving big corporations the chance to get congress to overturn these decisions so they can make their big $ is terrible idea  https://t.co/qIVFCpKOQK
Continuing to talk about how harsh the penalties are on #ZTE for violating sanctions is a effort to distract from the core issue. ZTE poses a significant threat to U.S. national security. If we can put them out of business we must &amp; should. #Huaweiisnext  https://t.co/2KMpH4I7a0

Some media reactions to @potus comments on #KJU are fair, may others are complete overreaction. But lost in the daily outrage cycle is  this critical FACT: Reason KJU is at table is sanctions. And they will remain in place until #NorthKorea denuclearizes  https://t.co/7IxeREir4S
As I said yesterday in Foreign Relations hearing still time for a peaceful path forward in #Nicaragua  

1. Allow NGO’s to help groups build political &amp; electoral capacity

2. Intl supervised referendum on Ortega in 2018

3. Intl supervised presidential elections in early 19
Alarming increase in #Suicide is a reminder that we have serious problems in our country that are much deeper than our economy &amp; can’t be measured by unemployment rate or GDP growth. The erosion of the family &amp; of community is leaving people isolated https://t.co/qEC76fXEMi
Why are we still giving so much money to the ⁦@UN⁩ ? The General Assembly vote was not just anti #Israel bias,it is anti-semitism disguised as international diplomacy. Totally grotesque that no mention of the evil acts committed by #Hamas

BTW @Apple who is very proud of how they are making it harder for American law enforcement to collect evidence from iPhones of criminals, had not problem turning over their ENTIRE CLOUD in #China to the Chinese government. Not just the phones ALL THE DATA https://t.co/jditvdGxFZ
The next time someone asks “what’s the difference between what China telecomms do &amp; what ours do?” show them this article. You think #Huawei or #ZTE can deny #China police ability to collect anything from their phones?  https://t.co/jditvdGxFZ
3 months ago blocked foreign purchase of ZTE’s top U.S. supplier b/c it would endanger natl security &amp; cede U.S. primacy in semiconductor &amp; wireless industry. But now we are saving #ZTE by allowing them to continue to buy same critical technology?  https://t.co/lPHe9uv1qE
The current deal with #ZTE does indeed make them pay a big price for violations of #NorthKorea &amp; #Iran sanctions. But our governments oversight over business side of ZTE will not be able to protect the U.S. from the technical threat they pose to the U.S.  https://t.co/NNEIWE2mgb
Important to remember #ZTE is about 2 seperate issues. 
1: Sanctions violations. The penalties imposed for that are ok. 
2: Risk they pose to our national security. This is the focus of our proposal. We should do NOTHING that keeps a national security threat in business ANYWHERE.
Watch @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom at 10AM will discuss how role of @potus &amp; congress on #NorthKorea are different. He’s the negotiator who needs to try &amp; strike a good deal. We have to define what is good &amp; approve it as treaty instead of it being unconstitutional like #IranDeal https://t.co/IpDwotu5Mk
#EVerify is a very important reform.  And while it is true that we struggle to find U.S. workers for many agriculture jobs, that is NOT true of construction. Americans can &amp; want to do construction work. https://t.co/u80MJ71prr
Yes the video @potus produced &amp; played for #KJU is unusual. But he was meeting with a different kind of guy. The video should be the least of our concerns. It won’t hurt &amp; showing the guy a little shine might actually work.  https://t.co/vbKNykEfS0 #axiosam

I bless the LORD who counsels me;even at night my heart exhorts me. I keep the LORD always before me; with him at my right hand, I shall never be shaken. Psalms 16: 7-8
One more thing about KJU. While I know @potus is trying to butter him up to get a good deal, #KJU is NOT a talented guy. He inherited the family business from his dad &amp; grandfather. He is a total weirdo who would not be elected assistant dog catcher in any democracy.
.@NickKristof I’m uncomfortable with suspending military exercises &amp; if this becomes permanent in exchange for nothing you are 100% correct. However after Trump bent over backwards to be conciliatory, if #KJU does nothing, intl sanctions will be easier to enforce &amp; increase https://t.co/rMplXVkANY
Any “deal” that doesn’t ultimately bring to an end these atrocities under #KimJongun is not a good deal.  https://t.co/jDL3vHDvaD
Should be skeptical of any deal with #KJU Limits to future strategic weapons instead of eliminating current program not an acceptable outcome. Hope I’m wrong but still believe they will never give up nukes &amp; ICBM’s unless believe failure to do so triggers regime ending reaction
Presidents meeting with #KJU exposed incredible hypocrisy of many in media. When Obama did these things,he was described as enlightened. When Trump does it he is reckless &amp; foolish. 1 yr ago they attacked Trump for leading us towards war,now attack for being too quick for peace
I too have concerns about how all this with #NorthKorea will turn out. But I don’t recall all the “experts” criticizing Obama when he met with a brutal dictator in #Cuba who also oversaw a police state &amp; also killed &amp; jailed his opponents. #DoubleStandard  https://t.co/j5x6wPiMGb
It is true @Potus did what previous administration didn’t do,punish #ZTE for sanctions violations. But this is about much more than sanctions violation. It is about the threat ZTE &amp; #Huawei pose to U.S. telecomm infrastructure.  https://t.co/A7Ii35gHvH
How long, O people, will you be hard of heart? Why do you love what is worthless, chase after lies? Psalms 4:3

The message from latest @ChickfilA incident is this: “Your church can still teach traditional marriage (which by the way we will still label as a bigoted belief) but don’t you dare repeat it outside of church or we will come after you, your business and/or your job.”
.@ChickfilA isn’t denying service to anyone. But if you eat there you must be attacked by the twitter mob b/c owner agrees with what his church teaches about marriage? Why would twitter mob stop at biz owned by Christians? Who is next? Christian schools? Christian charities?
This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch

Many valid points here. Our allies do impose unfair tariffs &amp; non-tariff barriers on us. But we should first have worked with them to focus solely on #China &amp; then dealt with these issues after. Read: The Era of American Complacency on Trade Is Over https://t.co/bdDF6orO8I

Why is #ZTE and #Huawei a big threat? #China already on verge of becoming global leader in 5G. Will have full scale deployment by 2020 &amp; have approval for stations in Europe. This will allow them to dominate autonomous vehicles &amp; Internet of Things. All using tech stolen from us
I’m rooting for the Knights. How about you? https://t.co/5xKA2aEDbn
I assure you with 100% confidence that #ZTE is a much greater national security threat than steel from Argentina or Europe. #VeryBadDeal
This “deal” with #ZTE may keep them from selling to Iran and North Korea. That’s good. But it will do nothing to keep us safe from corporate &amp; national security espionage. That is dangerous. Now Congress will need to act to keep America safe from #China

Great move yesterday by @Potus to confront #China on its economic abuses. But in a sign of the derangement that has infected our politics,some are so anti-Trump they parrot the Chinese criticism of his decision. This attitude that “if Trump is for it, it must be bad” is crazy.
Glorify the LORD, Jerusalem; Zion, offer praise to your God, For he has strengthened the bars of your gates,

I am very happy for Josh Holt &amp; his family. He was an innocent America hostage in #Venezuela &amp; his UNCONDITIONAL release was long overdue.
For administration this is about right penalty for #ZTE violating sanctions. For me its about #China stealing tech &amp; IP to catch up to &amp; surpass us. They are not going to stop until they face significant consequences. Such as ZTE going out of business https://t.co/f4e6jIzjQL
Maduro swearing-in early,calls for dialogue &amp; gestures of goodwill are all part of his effort to consolidate support in the face of growing discontent within his own government. But the ONLY action that will remove U.S. sanctions is the return of democracy https://t.co/Wtxu9hUIzc

Another absurd analysis. If after 65 years S.Korea can get N.Korea to act responsibly without U.S. maximum pressure that’s great news. Good luck with that! And if China welcomes even stronger U.S. military in Asia, they should go ahead &amp; support N.Korea  https://t.co/it15DWMcvH

Kim Jong un stays in power through force &amp; deception &amp; believes nukes give him prestige &amp; reduce chances of U.S. attack. He never wanted a nuke deal,he wanted as much sanctions relief as possible without giving them up. Unfortunately the options on dealing with him are narrowing
Yes they have a deal in mind. It is a great deal... for #ZTE &amp; China. #China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy &amp; they use these telecomm companies to spy &amp; steal from us. Many hoped this time would be different. Now congress will need to act.  https://t.co/ETMUCe9ia6

Kim Jun Un, in the words of a wise man “Congratulations, you just played yourself”. Withdrawing from talks with #NKorea is 100% the right decision. #KJU doesn’t want a deal. He has deliberately sabotaged the talks over the last two weeks &amp; was setting us up to take the blame.
#NKorea “shutting down” test site is a show to make #KJU appear cooperative &amp; responsible.  Bottom line is they either give up nukes &amp; missiles or they don’t. I suspect they don’t want a deal,but want U.S. blamed for it so international sanctions collapse  https://t.co/swc5F8YsKv
Time will tell whether they can report on China without interference. We should watch this closely. I hope they can pull it off and be able to report honestly and openly. Had ok article yesterday. We shall see. But if not, they should be registered as foreign agent.

The end of terrible #IranDeal &amp; quick &amp; decisive response to fake election in #Venezuela is testament to the fact that with @SecPompeo @stevenmnuchin1 &amp; @AmbJohnBolton in place, @POTUS now has a team that will execute, not block, his orders on foreign policy.
Here is #ZTE timeline: Violated U.S. sanction laws &amp; got caught lying &amp; covering up. Paid $1billion fine &amp; agreed to discipline employees. But then lied again &amp; instead of discipline gave those employees bonuses. Now we are offering same deal of fine &amp; employee discipline?
Sadly #China is out-negotiating the administration &amp; winning the trade talks right now. They have avoided tariffs &amp; got a #ZTE deal without giving up anything meaningful in return by using N.Korea talks &amp; agriculture issues as leverage. This is #NotWinning https://t.co/5kGO3qRGfY
Being a tool for espionage &amp; theft of U.S. intellectual property is bad enough. But #ZTE was sanctioned because it blatantly broke previous agreement with U.S. &amp; vi­o­lated sanc­tions against #Iran &amp; #NorthKo­rea. But we trust them with a new agreement? https://t.co/LXxihRykqz
If this is true, then administration has surrendered to #China on #ZTE Making changes to their board &amp; a fine won’t stop them from spying &amp; stealing from us. But this is too important to be over. We will begin working on veto-proof congressional action https://t.co/LXxihRykqz

Facing dissatisfaction within his own governing party Maduro thought sham election would help consolidate his power. Instead it consolidated sanctions &amp; isolation. Now he will concentrate power in a smaller inner circle &amp; many party leaders are about to be marginalized or jailed.
Maduro very wrong if he thinks fake election will alleviate sanctions. @POTUS just imposed new sanctions that restrict the regime’s ability to earn kickbacks through sales of state assets &amp; that prohibit buying any debt owed to Govt of #Venezuela,including debts owed to @PDVSA

The wind-down periods of 90 &amp; 180 days on #IranDeal is not “buying time”. Some of the business deals with Iran are complicated &amp; will take time for Treasury to re-impose sanctions. Todays announcement will have an IMMEDIATE chilling effect on lucrative deals with Iranian regime.
Ignored in much of the analysis on the #IranDeal is the fact that it freed them up to grow more dangerous in the Middle-East. Since deal they increased control over Syria, grew influence in Iraq, sponsored civil war in Yemen, exploited the Gulf divide &amp; expanded Hezbollah’s reach

@LeonardPittsJr1 You admit none of your friends or family supported Trump. Yet despite not knowing any Trump voters personally you know they are motivated by bigotry &amp; racism. I guess labeling an entire group based on stereotypes, what you saw on tv &amp; limited personal knowledge is ok after all.
@LeonardPittsJr1 That is just false. That report does not say anywhere that Trump voters were motivated by “racial animus” In fact it found that: “white working-class Americans are roughly as likely as Americans overall to believe many minority groups face substantial discrimination in society.”
@MelissaAmour72 @LeonardPittsJr1 Actually upper middle class,well educated Republicans is one of the subsets of Republicans he did poorest among. And the bigot argument is undermined by the fact that in several key states the election was decided by working class voters who voted for Obama in 12  but Trump in 16
@LeonardPittsJr1 And defining 63 million voters as motivated by bigotry based on the actions of some people at a rally is like judging the entire fan base of the Philadelphia Eagles because of the riots after the Super Bowl.  And it doesn’t explain similiar convulsions in Europe, Brexit etc.
@LeonardPittsJr1 Not accurate. Data indicates party registration was the top vote predictor. The 2nd was feeling like a “stranger in their own land” which is driven by a fear that a rapidly changing economy &amp; society no longer values people like them &amp;/or no longer shares their traditional values
@LeonardPittsJr1 In a republic, engaging with the people on the other side isn’t some noble gesture, it’s the ONLY thing that works.  We may want to divorce each other, but we will never be able to get separated. So we better figure out how to live together, or none of us will ever be happy. 2/2
@LeonardPittsJr1 Most voted for him despite those things, not b/c of them. He connected with workers hurt by the global economy &amp; people who feel forgotten by both parties. Answer isn’t to marginalize 1/2 our people. It’s proving we can address their concerns without forgetting who we are 1/2
@LeonardPittsJr1 Your new column actually proves my point. My tweet wasn’t about Trump,it was about your contempt for the Americans who voted for him. The people you now write we need to marginalize b/c they have “neither the capacity nor the interest” to be reasoned with. https://t.co/l67k513A6p

In #UsVsThem @ianbremmer gets it right about Trump voters. They “aren’t stupid or mean spirited.” They just feel that “that too many politicians care more about universal ideals than about American workers &amp; families.” It is a great disservice to America to ignore these concerns
Just read #UsVsThem by @ianbremmer It outlines how while our divisions weren’t created by Trump, they do explain his victory. He’s right that “those who dismiss (Trump) supporters are damaging the U.S.” It’s why we need an #AmericanConservatism that addresses their legit concerns https://t.co/NA6x7yp6mx

Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by. John: 19 41-42
But he was pierced for our sins,crushed for our iniquity.

Story media missing is that in 5 weeks since #Parkland tragedy,the families of 17 victims found common ground,treated everyone with civility,got legislation passed in #Florida &amp; are on verge of passing #STOPSchoolViolenceAct &amp; #FixNicsAct in D.C.

The U.S. House has just passed the #StopSchoolViolenceAct a bill that will help prevent not just school shootings, but any kind of mass shooting by identifying &amp; stopping a shooter before they act. Now its time for the Senate to act.
Spoke at a bipartisan press conference on the need to move forward with the STOP School Violence Act. This is something we agree on and can do now to help stop the next school shooting before it happens. https://t.co/WYDjlK80tj

The more we learn, the more it appears the problem is not the program or the DOE guidance itself, but the way it is being applied. It may have created a culture discourages referral to law enforcement even in egregious cases like the #Parkland shooter.
One big problem with this article today in @NYTimes the #Parkland killer was never in the “Promise” program this article touts as “model” to address racial disparity. That’s point of my inquiries, not clear where killer was in the school discipline system. https://t.co/XyEu83Ab4D

For far too long, Washington has ignored and left behind the American working class. Increasing the refundability of the Child Tax Credit from 55% to 70% is a solid step toward broader reforms which are both Pro-Growth and Pro-Worker.

If Cuban people are hurt it will be because the Castro govt doesn't allow them to own their own business, not because of the new policy
The truth is for many supporters of Obama #Cuba policy it was about $ for them, even if it meant doing business with the Castro military.

But notice how U.S. opponents of #BetterDealforCuba avoid mentioning core of the policy, prohibition on doing business with Cuban military

Grateful that I have more twitter followers than @miamiherald has readers, so I can set the record straight on false reporting. MR
There was no "special ceremony" at embassy to thank me for support of "peace deal". It was a dinner thanking me for support of Colombia 3/3
I didn't support "peace deal". I supported "Peace Colombia". That is the US funding plan which prohibits money for the FARC 2/3
140 characters not enough to detail all the falsehoods in article but here are 2.  1/3  https://t.co/tvvA7l1u8R
1st they write a story that is wrong, then when you point it out they write a 2nd one to say you are "backtracking" https://t.co/tvvA7l1u8R
@MaryAnastasiaOG Which means, no money, visas or delisting for FARC, no release for Simon Trinidad etc.
@MaryAnastasiaOG You leave out the rest: " will work to ensure...that crimes committed by the FARC do not go unpunished &amp; victims are adequately compensated"
My position is same as has always been: Peace Deal is up to #Colombia. But no US $ or Visas for FARC &amp; Simon Trinidad stays in fed prison
Puzzled by this article. Speech never said I "backed" the #Colombia peace deal.Said continued aid with conditions https://t.co/DEWx3Hr3jD
@MaryAnastasiaOG I never said anything about supporting the peace deal in my speech. I said I supported continued funding of Colombia with conditions.
