This would be a tragic mistake by Senate GOP, and would call into question why they are even in office in the first place.
I hear Senate Republicans may not ever force a vote on the Iran deal, now that it appears Obama has the 41 votes to filibuster.
The one time it‚Äôs most legitimate to use the so called ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù option in the Senate would be to prevent Iran from having a nuclear option.

(6/6) Justice Scalia said, ‚ÄúWords no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is ‚Äòestablished by the State."
(5/6) He admits they aren‚Äôt paying attention to what the law actually says. The person who really nailed it is Justice Scalia.
(4/6) This is from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a person who is not accountable to the people, but with a lifetime appointment.
(3/6) We know that we are ignoring what Obamacare really says, but we think it is politically best to not overturn it
2/6) natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.‚Äù Those are some fancy words. I will act as your Supreme Court translator today:

Ready to believe again? Join me:
http://t.co/f4geDGEeRO
Believe in what we can do. Believe in what America can do.
If you are chasing a dream and looking for a land where the people are free, and the opportunities are real, I‚Äôm asking you to believe.
If you are looking for a candidate who will politely manage America‚Äôs descent into mediocrity, I‚Äôm not your man.
Containment is a strategy for losers.  But as General George S. Patton famously observed ‚Äì ‚ÄúAmericans play to win all the time.‚Äù
To be clear, we are not simply trying to reclaim the past. We are laying our claim on the future, a future where America leads the world.
Let‚Äôs do something new, let‚Äôs endorse our own principles for a change and boldly speak the truth without fear.
We are not Indian-Americans, Irish‚ÄìAmericans,  African‚ÄìAmericans, rich Americans, or poor Americans ‚Äì we are all Americans.
America did not create religious liberty, religious liberty created the United States of America.
I know that some say I talk too much about my faith. But I won‚Äôt be silenced to meet their expectations of political correctness.
If you want someone who will pretend that everything is fine and just make some small tweaks ‚Äì then you want someone else.
But rest assured -- I‚Äôm tanned, rested, and ready for this fight.
We can repeal Obamacare and we will.
In Washington they know that the voters want the border secured, but they refuse to do it.  But you and I can, and we will.
They think we need a permanent class of elites.  It‚Äôs safer to not rock the boat.   But we can rock the boat, and we will.
They say you cannot actually cut government spending.  But we can, and we will.
I'm not running for president to be somebody, I'm running for President to do something.
We did what they said couldn‚Äôt be done. We shrank our govt. We cut our budget by 26% and the number of govt bureaucrats by more than 30,000.
Now we have statewide school choice ‚Äì because every child deserves an equal opportunity for a great education.
We privatized our outdated government-run hospital system, we reformed education, with nearly 100% charter schools in New Orleans.
My parents found that America is indeed the land of the free and home of the brave.
My name is Bobby Jindal, I am the Governor of the great state of Louisiana, and I am running for President of the United States.

Out of respect for those murdered in Charleston, I issued an Executive Order to fly flags over state buildings at half-staff.
.@LSUBaseball it‚Äôs time to avenge Sunday‚Äôs loss and send TCU home. #GeauxCWS
(3/3) I would hope that the President would focus exclusively on unifying the country at a time like this.
(2/3) Now is the time for the nation to wrap their arms around the families, the church, the city, and the state of South Carolina.
(1/3) It‚Äôs a shame that in his first statement to the nation, the President would inject gun control politics into this.
In honor of Father‚Äôs Day, today‚Äôs #TBT is a classic photo of me and my dad. http://t.co/MmwxmrUnz3
(3/3) Every American needs to take a few minutes today, and in the days to come, to pray for the families of those murdered last night.
(2/3) I'm enraged by this ungodly act and my heart breaks for these families. I hurt for them.
(1/3) We are all trying to make sense of this senseless act. This is pure evil. It's infuriating. Mankind's capacity for evil is horrific.
A gritty and hard fought win by @LSUBaseball! #GeauxCWS

(5/5) It‚Äôs been a great session and I‚Äôm proud of the legislators‚Äô hard work.
(4/5) Lastly, I‚Äôm proud that we protected religious liberty through an exec order after legislators declined to take a vote on the merits.
(3/5) I‚Äôm proud that we took back local control of education from the federal government and put us on a path to get out of Common Core.
(2/5) I‚Äôm proud that we came together this session to pass a balanced budget that protects higher ed and healthcare without a tax increase.

Read my full statement on Senator Paul‚Äôs comments here: http://t.co/67PAelWWtl
(5/5) It has become impossible to imagine a President Paul defeating Radical Islam and it's time for the rest of us to say it.
(4/5) The next President must have the discipline and strength to wipe ISIS off the face of the earth.
(3/5) Let‚Äôs be clear; evil and Radical Islam are at fault for the rise of ISIS, and people like Pres. Obama &amp; Hillary Clinton exacerbate it.
(2/5) U.S. weakness, not strength, emboldens our enemies. His illogical argument clouds a situation that should provide pure moral clarity.
(1/5) Sen. Paul‚Äôs comments on ISIS take the weakest, most liberal Dem position, showing he is unsuited to be Commander-in-Chief.
Our Harvard constitutional law President sure has a hard time with the law. http://t.co/3OeUZWDdSI

We do not support discrimination, and we do support religious liberty. We believe that we can uphold both of those values simultaneously.
Here in Louisiana, as long as I‚Äôm your Governor, we will protect religious liberty and not apologize for it.
Education is an issue I care deeply about ‚Äì and that‚Äôs why I am here to tell you, we have to get rid of Common Core.
Since my first year as Governor, we have implemented some of the most comprehensive and ambitious education reforms in our state‚Äôs history.
And I am proud to say the economy is bigger, the government is smaller and our state is stronger than ever.
I have confidence we'll come together, make smart reductions to the size of govt &amp; produce a balanced budget that doesn‚Äôt raise taxes.
We must balance our budget without raising taxes on our people.  It is their money, not ours.
Reform is always controversial, and democracy is messy, but the end result is a stronger more prosperous Louisiana for our children.

The President is an inept Commander-in-chief.http://t.co/SxRrfkqeHF
This Pres can sit at a negotiating table with folks who say "death to America," but cannot sit at a table with the Prime Minister of Israel.
It‚Äôs simply because President Obama doesn‚Äôt value the strategic and historic bond between the United States and Israel.
How did we get to a point where the WH believes the Iranian Supreme Leader‚Äôs comments about "death to America" are just political rhetoric?
I realize Pres Obama is accustomed to misleading the voters, but he shouldn't assume Middle Eastern tyrants use words as loosely as he does.
We owe thanks to law enforcement &amp; airport security for bravely standing in harm's way and we will continue praying for their full recovery.
Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured last night at the New Orleans airport.
It‚Äôs obvious that Sec. Clinton‚Äôs legacy as the architect of Obama‚Äôs foreign policy will be a liability in her quest to become President.
If Sec. Clinton says nothing, as is her custom, then she affirms the President‚Äôs decision to abandon our closest ally in the Middle East.
It‚Äôs time for Hillary Clinton, architect of the President‚Äôs foreign policy, to say if she supports Obama‚Äôs decision to abandon Israel.
This move away from Israel is another example of the hallmark of his foreign policy - treat friends like enemies and enemies like friends.
It‚Äôs firmly established that President Obama is no friend of Israel, and is attempting to corrode our alliance with the Israeli people.
I‚Äôm live with @MegynKelly at 8:40 CST to discuss the danger radical Islam poses to America and the world and what Obama should be doing.

We must strengthen our relationship with our great ally Israel, and stop Iran from securing a nuclear weapon.
Everyone knows that the Obama Administration was rooting for the Prime Minister to lose, but it‚Äôs time for the President to change course.
Dangerous times require strong leadership, and that is what the Israeli people chose when they re-elected Prime Minister Netanyahu.
To honor the military members who lost their lives in the Black Hawk crash, state buildings will fly flags at half-staff.
.@HillaryClinton No one who allows Iran to become a nuclear power should consider running.
Our guardsmen fought courageously overseas, and here at home, they have protected what matters most during times of crisis.
4 members of the crew are part of the LA Natl Guard. These soldiers represent the best of LA, &amp; we are praying for them and their families.
I spoke to the Adjutant General of the LA Natl Guard to offer prayers &amp; support for servicemembers who are missing from the Blackhawk crash.
It‚Äôs time for the President to focus on the real enemy ‚Äì Radical Islam and a nuclear Iran.
We currently have an occupant in the White House who thinks we are at war with medieval Christians and Senate Republicans.
.@BarackObama's obsession to cut a deal with Iran, regardless of the cost, is the reason we are where we are today.
Make no mistake ‚Äì any Iran deal that President Obama makes is not binding on a future president.
Anyone thinking of running for Prez, on both sides, should sign on to the letter to make clear that Iran is negotiating w/ lame duck Prez.
.@VP Biden owes¬†@SenTomCotton an apology. He wore the boots in Iraq. He's earned our attention, not your insults.
I support the letter sent by @SenTomCotton &amp; his colleagues to Iran warning them that Congress will have to approve any nuclear deal.

The U.S. should work closely with the French government to track down and eliminate all those involved in today's act of terror.
The war on terror is real and these threats need to be confronted and destroyed for freedom to prosper.
That these terrorists targeted members of the press shows their contempt for the freedom of expression and the values of a free society.
The attack in Paris is another reminder of the horrific evil that terrorists are capable of. We must stop at nothing to eliminate them.
I hope the new Republican Congress sends President Obama this bill as soon as possible and forces him to do the right thing.

He won't because his admin is full of ‚Äòscience deniers‚Äô who want 2 make energy expensive &amp; push our country toward energy austerity.
By embracing U.S. resources &amp; technological abilities, we can make energy cheaper &amp; more abundant. But President Obama won‚Äôt do it.
Instead of pursuing the top-down energy policy of the Obama Admin, we should be on a path to an era of energy independence and job growth.
That‚Äôs why he wants to force this new job-killing emission rule on the American people.
President Obama doesn‚Äôt trust the American people or American companies. He believes Washington knows what‚Äôs best.
It's exactly the type of policy and top-down governing that the American people rejected on Election Day a few weeks ago.
The new emission plan would force companies to limit production that is vital to our economy and buy unnecessary, expensive technology.

Our border is not secure. If we want to solve our immigration problem, job one is to secure the border.
Unilaterally granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants does nothing to solve our immigration problem, it only makes it worse.
The President is lecturing us and not listening to us. He‚Äôs bypassing Congress, and ignoring the American people.
It was great to be with @ChuckTodd and other Republican governors today to talk about the road forward for America. http://t.co/MM64kZPuh9
Mary faked a hearing, but she can't fake passage of Keystone.
Memo to Democrat politicians -- after 6 years of doing everything Obama wanted, the President and Harry Reid throw Mary overboard.

That‚Äôs why we must always stand with our close friend and ally, condemn the act of terror and defend their right to defend themselves.
Unfortunately, Israel is no stranger to these types of attacks.
These are people depraved of any humanity in their hearts, and they must not only be stopped, they must be exterminated.
An attack on a synagogue shows that there are no bounds for terrorists.
Our hearts and prayers are with the victims and their families after this evil attack on a place of worship.
In regards to Medicaid Expansion: this is not free money. https://t.co/m0MiXNoT7J
President Obama shouldn't shut down the government and break the Constitution. https://t.co/y47FE4p4ak
Obamacare is a top down closed approach where government is running your healthcare.
https://t.co/jnNEtYBbzQ
As states consider whether or not to expand Medicaid, we hear the old deceitful yarn ‚Äì ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs free money from the federal government.‚Äù
Louisiana tried government run health care for the last 50 years. It didn‚Äôt work.
Medicaid expansion will cost Louisiana taxpayers up to $1.7 billion over ten years.
Medicaid expansion would result in 248,000 leaving private insurance, putting half of Louisiana‚Äôs population on Medicaid.
Medicaid expansion prioritizes able-bodied adults over seniors in Medicare.
I will be talking with @ChuckTodd about repealing and replacing Obamcare, the Keystone Pipeline, Obama‚Äôs Immigration strategy and more.
I‚Äôm going to be on @MeetThePress in a half hour! 
http://t.co/pVmiTpraXo
Hey @MaryLandrieu, use your ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù to get @BarackObama to repeal Obamacare.
If @MaryLandrieu really cared about Louisiana, she would force a vote to approve the Keystone Pipeline AND repeal Obamacare.
Well I guess a looming @MaryLandrieu defeat has made Senate Democrats reconsider the Keystone Pipeline. It‚Äôs about time.
Your tireless service on behalf of all Americans and our great country will never be forgotten.
To all of our veterans, we thank you today and every day for fighting so that we may be free.
We enjoy liberty and the ability to pursue the American Dream thanks to those who fought tirelessly before us to protect and preserve.
Every day should be Veterans Day here in America, because every day we are able to walk in freedom because of these military men and women.
Today we honor our veterans for their service to our nation, but we don't have to wait until Veterans Day to honor and thank a veteran.
It‚Äôs closing time for Mary Landrieu‚Ä¶ she doesn‚Äôt have to come home, but she can‚Äôt stay in the Senate anymore.
She‚Äôs resorted to calling us racist for opposing President Obama‚Äôs policies.
She‚Äôs failed to secure our border. She‚Äôs failed to protect Medicare for our seniors. She‚Äôs failed to protect our 2nd Amendment freedoms.
Mary has spent 18 years in Washington, and all we have to show for it is less freedom, more government, more debt and more failure.
It was great to stand in support of @BillCassidy in the final push to retire Mary Landrieu. http://t.co/wrpquMDgUB

We will stop at nothing to put the perpetrators of these horrific crimes behind bars. Together, we can end human trafficking.
Today, Louisiana received a score of 96 by @SharedHope in its overall grade, the highest in the country and a jump from a C ranking in 2011.
I am proud to announce @SharedHope has ranked Louisiana #1 in the nation for cracking down on human trafficking. http://t.co/iu5pGA4Kja
Washington is worse off today than it was 18 years ago.  It‚Äôs time to try something new.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm supporting @BillCassidy.
The bottom line is that @MaryLandrieu does not represent Louisiana values.
.@MaryLandrieu is powerless to convince the Obama Administration to approve the Keystone Pipeline.
.@MaryLandrieu was powerless to stop President Obama‚Äôs Gulf of Mexico oil and gas moratorium.
But @MaryLandrieu is powerless to stop the EPA from passing regulations that hurt our famers and our businesses.
.@MaryLandrieu says she is powerful.
.@MaryLandrieu says the people of Louisiana oppose President Obama because we are racist. Does that represent Louisiana values?
.@MaryLandrieu cut Medicare by $700 billion in order to expand Medicaid for able-bodied childless adults. Does that represent LA values?
.@MaryLandrieu has a D rating from the NRA.  Does that represent Louisiana values?
.@MaryLandrieu has supported limiting the 2nd Amendment.  She voted to confirm an anti-gun Supreme Court justice.
Does that represent Louisiana Values?
We have an illegal immigration problem because Washington refuses to secure our border, yet @MaryLandrieu called a border fence ‚Äúdumb.‚Äù
The central question Louisiana voters must ask themselves is whether @MaryLandrieu still represents Louisiana values.
This runoff is not about the President, Harry Reid, or Mitch McConnell.  This runoff is about @MaryLandrieu.
We need to challenge the President to get with the program. We need to give him the opportunity to do something right for a change.
The American people have given us an opportunity. Let‚Äôs go show them what conservative values are about.
Now it‚Äôs time to actually do something with this newfound power. This is our moment.
It‚Äôs a rejection of progressivism, a rejection of big government, and a rejection of Obamacare.
Last nights results are an outright rejection of what President Obama and big government liberals stand for.

Stage 4 of Obama Crisis Management: Republicans are obstructing.
Stage 3 of Obama Crisis Management: More money will fix it.
Stage 2 of Obama Crisis Management: I'm so mad.
Stage 1 of Obama Crisis Management:  Don‚Äôt worry, I got this.
Here are the four stages from the @BarackObama School of Crisis Management.
I guess we've hit the "I'm so mad " stage of the crisis. http://t.co/3tvfoenOB4
Fed govt is reportedly considering adding healthcare workers who were in contact with an Ebola patient to the no-fly list. It‚Äôs a no-brainer
Healthcare professionals currently in the U.S. who have been in contact with Ebola shld be added to the domestic/international no-fly list.
The fed. govt shld block people‚Äìexcept first-responders, healthcare professionals, relief workers‚Äìfrom traveling to/from countries w/Ebola.
At the very least, we need to place more travel restrictions on who can travel to and from Ebola-stricken countries.
Even though it makes common sense to do this, the White House has refused to do it.
The best way to stop the spread of Ebola is for the Obama Admin to shut down flights from Ebola-stricken countries.
People want to trust the so-called experts in DC, but reality always turns out to be a complete 180 from the White House‚Äôs talking points.
Then @BarackObama said it was unlikely that Ebola would spread. Then it did.
First @BarackObama said it was unlikely that Ebola would reach the United States. Then it did.
Every day comes with another press conference and another admission from the White House about what they should have done differently.
.@BarackObama seems to be more focused on getting through the 24-hour news cycle than actually solving the Ebola problem.
.@BarackObama is committing malpractice on his administration‚Äôs response to the Ebola crisis.
The latest nightmare caused by the incompetence of @BarackObama is his detached response to the Ebola crisis.
.@BarackObama came into office promising competent govt, but his tenure has been anything but competent.
I surveyed the damage in Monroe first-hand today. I met with local officials, first responders, and those affected. http://t.co/hYJeqstDzt

http://t.co/U4iQswz4cY
Much of the rhetoric about Ebola is misleading, if not downright dishonest.

http://t.co/U4iQswz4cY
.@HillaryClinton‚Äôs partisan politics detract from the real issue, the Obama administration mismanaged CDC funding.  
http://t.co/U4iQswz4cY

Threats will continue to grow unless and until America regains its purpose and rebuilds the power that is the foundation of our safety.
There is less need to use the military when it is feared and respected.
Peace through strength costs infinitely less in American blood and treasure than does war precipitated by weakness.
The safest and the surest thing America can do now to reduce global risk ‚Äì would be to move decisively to rebuild the tools of power.
Disengagement is not a prescription for American security, nor is it the basis for a successful American foreign policy.
It‚Äôs no accident that the threats to America ‚Äì to its homeland and its national interests ‚Äì are growing everywhere in the world.
President Obama is the first president to not believe in American exceptionalism.
Obama Admin has repudiated principles of an effective defense strategy by abandoning long-time allies &amp; cutting the size of our military.
The last 6 yrs ‚Äì and the last several months in particular ‚Äì have demonstrated the failure of Pres Obama‚Äôs attempts to ‚Äúlead from behind."
This seems to be an obvious step to protect public health in the United States.
How exactly would stopping the entry of people potentially carrying the Ebola virus be counterproductive?
In fact, they said it would be counterproductive to stop these flights. That statement defies logic.
But the Obama Admin keeps saying they won‚Äôt shut down flights. They instead say we should listen to ‚Äúthe experts.‚Äù
.@BarackObama said it was ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù that Ebola would reach the U.S. Well, it has, and we need to protect our people.
Even countries in Africa have cut back on or stopped accepting flights from countries w/ Ebola outbreaks.
The Obama Admin needs to stop accepting flights from countries that are Ebola stricken.
Louisiana charter schools are rated 2nd in the nation in growth, performance and innovation.

While we certainly hope that Louisiana never has an Ebola case, our healthcare system and our emergency responders will be prepared.
These include procedures for emergency medical workers, hospital physicians and regional emergency response coordinators.
For the last several weeks, Louisiana has been working to ready our state's public health and medical infrastructure for various scenarios.
First and foremost, at present there are no known cases of Ebola in LA, but our state agencies are prepared.
At @GOHSEP, I got an update from state agencies, ensuring the state is prepared if a case of Ebola were to be present in Louisiana.
Today I met with @GOHSEP to get updates from state agencies to ensure we are prepared if a case of Ebola were to be present here in LA.

We got Jordan Cameron as our TE. I hope he can follow up last year's performance.
We need an under the radar tight end. Who's gonna be this year's sleeper?
We have QB, RB and WR. Should we get a good defense early, or go for a TE?
Shockingly, Johnny Manziel is still on the board.
I got @MattForte22 as my RB. Who should i try and snag as QB? Luck, Manning, Stafford, Rodgers, Brady Wilson and Brees are off the board.

As with any balky automobile, it‚Äôs time for the American people to trade in this ObamaCare lemon, and replace it with something that works.

The Court has made clear today that the Obama administration's assault on religious freedom went way too far.
The Supreme Court formally recognized what the overwhelming majority of Americans already know: that religious liberty is a good thing.

Education is a primary responsibility of states, and we will not cede this responsibility to the federal government.
We can certainly have high standards without giving up control of Louisiana‚Äôs education system to the federal government.
Common Core has not been fully implemented in LA, and we need to start the process over. It was rushed in beginning &amp; done w/o public input.
We‚Äôre very alarmed about choice and local control over curriculum being taken away from parents and educators.
It's time for PARCC to withdraw from Louisiana. We won‚Äôt let the federal government take over Louisiana‚Äôs education standards.
We will not let President Obama and Secretary Duncan take over the education of Louisiana's children.
Our Founders came up with the Tenth Amendment for good reason, but the Obama Administration wants to keep ignoring it.
We will not be bullied by fed govt. Common Core advocates claim it not a fed takeover, but Sec. Duncan's comments &amp; actions prove otherwise.

Dear AG Holder.After u watch this vid http://t.co/dukN6O1kaW, hope you'll reconsider standing in the way of kids having an equal opportunity

This President conveys weakness 2 our allies and our enemies. American weakness leads 2 violence, American strength leads 2 stability. (3/3)
I feel I owe an apology to President Carter...President Obama has surpassed you.(2/3)
I used to say Pres Obama was the worst president since Jimmy Carter. Now, that he's outsourced American foreign policy to VladimirPutin(1/3)

.@GovMalloyOffice "Fewer people in poverty?" CBO says it will cost 500k people their jobs. We can do better than #obamasminimumwageeconomy
Pres. Obama could act to create thousands of good paying jobs -delay Obamacare, approve Keystone, roll back EPA regs. http://t.co/iXXVZBZSuL
President Obama has brought us a minimum wage economy.  He has given up on growth.
.@GovMalloyOffice - We don't have kings in the U.S. We have right to disagree with the policies of President Obama. http://t.co/ANyYbSFQGe
I believe America can do better than #ObamasMinimumWageEconomy. Sign our petition if you agree: https://t.co/Oudl8gKtTq
I'll be appearing on Fox News' Special Report tonight to talk how we can do better than President Obama's minimum wage economy. Tune in!
If President Obama is intent on acting unilaterally, he should use his pen and phone to create jobs. http://t.co/EIL5vm5zYj
Pres. Obama is very concerned about religious liberty. And also-if you like your religion, you can keep your religion.http://t.co/9PGBtjA5nu
Stunning that @BarackObama talks of protecting religious liberty outside U.S., but chips away religious liberty here. http://t.co/9PGBtjA5nu
Leaders across the U.S. must embark on effort at the state level to protect the rights of believers of all faiths.  http://t.co/zDGenb7Quf
The war on religious liberty-on your freedom to exercise religion, your freedom of expression ‚Äì is going to continue. http://t.co/zDGenb7Quf
Today the American people, whether we know it or not, are mired in a silent war. http://t.co/jQjyfOU2ON
Our religious freedom was won over the course of centuries of persecution and we must not surrender without a fight. http://t.co/yu7KlEl23c

Louisiana is first in the nation for AP exam improvement for the class of 2013. Our reforms are paying off. http://t.co/HOFcKSqlb9
In Louisiana we are focused on reforming Medicaid - improving care &amp; expanding services - not expanding Obamacare. http://t.co/KOGWRWMENq
Expanding eligibility to working adults only crowds out resources that can be invested in care for most vulnerable. http://t.co/VN1LXnJXvE
Obamacare‚Äôs Medicaid expansion prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over needs of persons with disabilities. http://t.co/OTfv82vNjQ
Obamacare is a recipe for increasing inequality, not decreasing it.  http://t.co/OTfv82vNjQ
Great story about @AntDavis23 of the @PelicansNBA getting nod for the @NBA All-Star game in New Orleans http://t.co/xnxMoV1dcp

Congress should act to block these latest Chicago style tactics by the IRS. http://t.co/mSVdke26QA
The IRS could easily use donor lists to harass &amp; intimidate those who disagree with the President's liberal agenda.  http://t.co/mSVdke26QA
The IRS is at it again. This time proposing that non-profit groups disclose member lists to D.C. bureaucrats. http://t.co/mSVdke26QA
At least we turned the lights out in New Orleans last year to make it interesting. #kidding
Securing the border is key, &amp; we can‚Äôt trust DC bureaucrats to verify it‚Äôs secure. Border state govs are the ones who can confirm it's done
We put a man on the moon, we saved the world from tyranny, we are Americans, we can secure our borders, but all we get from DC is talk
The key: secure the border FIRST. I repeat‚Äìsecure the border. It‚Äôll stop illegal immigration &amp; protect the US from people who mean us harm
But the key in all this is very simple, which is why it is so galling to the American people that DC can‚Äôt figure it out
I‚Äôm the son of immigrants who came here in search of two things‚Äìfreedom &amp; opportunity. My parents found both &amp; they &amp; country r better 4 it
We need the opposite. We need a secure border (ie., a high wall) &amp; a wider gate (ie., more legal immigration)
What we need is a high wall &amp; wide gate.We have lousy border security (ie., low wall) &amp; have too little legal immigration (ie., small gate)
Our immigration system is a joke. It‚Äôs completely backward. We currently have a very low wall and a very small gate.
Great to be on @CNNsotu this morning to discuss the major issues facing our country
.@BarackObama‚Äôs rhetoric doesn‚Äôt match his action. US DOJ wants to keep low-income, minority children trapped in failing schools

Big thanks @EricCantor for defending school choice and saying AG Holder must visit LA &amp; explain opposition to equal opportunity in education
The new DOJ legal filings prove the people in DC running our federal government are more interested in skin color than they are in education
DOJ believes bureaucrats in DC know better than LA parents, and cannot prove LA school choice is violating any law. http://t.co/I2KXcrv6GL
This evening, President Obama's DOJ is continuing its attempt to red-tape and regulate LA school choice. http://t.co/I2KXcrv6GL

The left may control Hollywood, but they don‚Äôt control the hearts and minds of a majority of Americans
The left is not the only group who is permitted to voice its opinion in the public square
The left is going to have to get accustomed to the fact that it does not have a monopoly on free speech
Today is a good day for the freedoms of speech and religious liberty
I‚Äôm glad to hear that A&amp;E came to its senses &amp; recognized that tolerance of religious views is more important than political correctness

I don‚Äôt agree with quite a bit of stuff I read in magazines or see on TV.   In fact, come to think of it, I find a good bit of it offensive.
The politically correct crowd is tolerant of all viewpoints, except those they disagree with. http://t.co/IK2fvrqGPn

Without question, George Rodrigue's paintings will live on, but his legacy will be much more than paint on a canvas.
His work made him an ambassador for our state and a renowned artist, but he never forgot his Louisiana roots.
His work as an artist is iconic &amp; uniquely Louisiana. George‚Äôs Blue Dog not only became symbolic of his work, but it became a symbol for LA
Supriya and I were saddened to learn of the passing this evening of a friend and one of Louisiana‚Äôs favorite sons, George Rodrigue.

Disastrous rollout of Obamacare proves we don‚Äôt need a top-down federal govt approach to fix our healthcare system http://t.co/02LqJAc0lc
In LA, we r building a bottom-up alternative by focusing on public-private partnerships 2 deliver better health care http://t.co/02LqJAc0lc

.@WhiteHouse FACT: Because of Obamacare, more than 92,000 Louisianians cannot keep their health insurance if they like it
.@WhiteHouse FACT: If Louisiana did Obamacare's Medicaid expansion,nearly 250k Louisianians cld be moved from private coverage to Medicaid

Any deal that puts the interests of Iran ahead of the security of America, Israel and our other allies should be rejected.
An agreement that reportedly allows Iran to continue manufacturing centrifuges and enriching uranium is a bad deal for America and Israel.

Obama Admin is incompetent for claiming it doesn‚Äôt have documents used to sue Louisiana on school choice. http://t.co/QlVpLzAf1T
Prez said if u like ur current plan u can keep it. Of course what he meant was "if I, Barack Obama, like your current plan you can keep it."
The Obama Administration‚Äôs lawsuit against Louisiana‚Äôs scholarship program is a case study on incompetence. http://t.co/IJQKYOuZNt
Should we go to DC to have a search party for these documents? Were these documents lost in the Obamacare website?  http://t.co/IJQKYOuZNt

For generations, the govt has given families no hope but to settle for failing schools. In LA, we are changing that. http://t.co/JeypY2hUoo
Pres. Obama &amp; AG Holder want to rip kids from their schools and handcuff them to the failing schools they came from. http://t.co/JeypY2hUoo
President Obama and AG Holder's actions in Louisiana are a complete rejection of MLK's dream. http://t.co/JeypY2hUoo

Whether it's based on incompetence or ideology, DOJ suit hurts most vulnerable kids who deserve a better education.http://t.co/uobj1jQh2E
On @oreillyfactor last night we discussed how DOJ suit is threatening to force LA children back into failing schools. http://t.co/uobj1jQh2E
I'll be on Fox News' @oreillyfactor tonight discussing the DOJ's move to deny LA children an equal opportunity of education. Tune in!

Check out this great article by John Fund @NRO. DOJ is threatening a child's right to an equal opport. of education. http://t.co/shCBTr1n1P
AG Holder and President Obama are wrong.  Every child should have access to equal opportunity of a great education.  http://t.co/n1ErXlQJ35
Shameful DOJ saying to parents: you don't have choice on where to educate your child, should stay in failing school. http://t.co/n1ErXlQJ35
In LA, we‚Äôre doing something about it. Parents now have the opportunity of school choice for their children.  http://t.co/n1ErXlQJ35
Equal opportunity in education not the reality in America. There are too many kids today trapped in failing schools. http://t.co/n1ErXlQJ35
Giving every child the opportunity for a great education is the next great civil rights fight. http://t.co/n1ErXlQJ35
.@BarackObama and Eric Holder - please, watch this video and you will understand why we have to give parents a choice http://t.co/xR2WZliTSQ
We will fight like heck to preserve our reforms in LA that give scholarships to low-income students who are trapped in failing schools.
Giving every single child ‚Äì no matter their race or their income ‚Äì the opportunity to get a great education is a moral imperative.
Parents should not have to ask permission from the federal government to enroll their kids in the school of their choice.
The DOJ has filed a petition attempting to deny equal opportunity in education and take away LA parents choice in education for their child.
These great rankings show our reforms are working.  Every day Louisiana is becoming a better place to start a family and start a business.

I believe that virtually all Americans will embrace immigration reform compassionately when our borders are secure. http://t.co/07vDxIiNDj
If D.C. truly wants to solve the crisis of 11 million illegals, they will get serious on securing border right now. http://t.co/07vDxIiNDj
Increase legal immigration by a lot, especially for skilled workers. Need to stop educating the world‚Äôs best and not allow them to stay.
Immigration reform should be done in 3 steps: 1.Secure the border; 2.Once border secure, create guest worker visas; 3. Increase LEGAL immig!
1,000 pages of pork, regs, and power for govt bureaucrats is not a solution any more than Obamacare is HC solution. http://t.co/07vDxIiNDj

I don't know if we can convince D.C. to continue funding this great program. But I know we are not going to give up our religious freedom.
The First Amendment was written to protect people of faith from government officials. And we are going to hold on to that freedom.
The simple fact is that these Washington officials want our faith and worship bottled up inside churches where it can‚Äôt infect others.
D.C. will say they're not stopping you from praying.  They just want you to do it at the right time, in the right place.
Thrilled to be at today's In God We Trust Rally w/ Sheriff Whittington to take stand against the fed govt denying funding for youth program
You know things are bad when you can‚Äôt even successfully implement your own bad ideas.
Congress passed the employer mandate into law, but the exec branch is refusing to enforce it.  Bureaucrats run this government.

The era of big government is strangling our freedom
Bigger government and more power in the hands of a few means the interests of the public will be violated
Look at liberalism across every issue, from healthcare 2 spending, 1 thing crystal clear, they don‚Äôt believe in dynamic power of freedom
IRS, AP, Benghazi, Obamacare problems aren‚Äôt failure of an individual,but failure of system in which liberals put too much trust in big govt
IRS, AP, Benghazi, Obamacare problems cut at core of @BarackObama Presidency and liberalism that big government is good
.@BarackObama problems on IRS, AP, Benghazi, Obamacare more than just DC scandal. Speaks to philosophy of big vs. small govt
Obama Presidency based on not trusting American people, belief that big gov better 4 people. Latest scandals show why liberalism doesnt work
IRS, AP, Benghazi, Obamacare. All seemingly unrelated, but all related in that problems arose b/c of lack of trust in the American people

Shorter @BarackObama: Things are great, gov't can do everything, more free stuff 4 everyone at no cost.
By the way, when @BarackObama says "it's not a bigger government we need" &amp; u consider his record &amp; the rest of his speech, its pretty funny
.@BarackObama is right that deficit reduction is not an economic plan...and neither is more government spending....
.@BarackObama says "we can‚Äôt just cut our way to prosperity." It may be true, but how does he know? He's never cut anything.
.@BarackObama giving a speech saying we don‚Äôt need bigger govt while he calls 4 bigger govt. But growing govt doesn‚Äôt grow the real economy

Congrats to #Louisiana native @hunterhayes on the #Grammy nominations. Making Louisiana proud.
.@GOPLeader is right about education reform - let the dollars follow the child, not the other way around. It's working in Louisiana.

We must shift the eye line and the ambition of our conservative movement away from managing government and toward the mission of growth.
We can either go down the Government path or the American path.
We do need to re-orient our focus to the place where conservatism thrives ‚Äì in the real world beyond the Washington Beltway.
We do not need to change what we believe as conservatives ‚Äì our principles are timeless.
We must not become the party of austerity. We must become the party of growth.
Our objective is to grow the private sector. We need to focus our efforts on ideas to grow the American economy, not the govt economy.
Instead of worrying about managing government, it‚Äôs time for us to address how we can lead America
We have to accept that government number crunching ‚Äì even conservative number crunching ‚Äì is not the answer to our nation‚Äôs problems.
In America, government is one of those things you have to have, but you sure don‚Äôt want too much of it.

Praying for @nikkihaley's husband Michael and all of our troops as they serve our country overseas
Time 2 change tax code so people can keep more of their money &amp; foster environment where businesses want to invest &amp; create good-paying jobs
4 too long, LA‚Äôs workers, small biz have suffered from having tax structure that‚Äôs too complex &amp; holds back economic prosperity
Tax reform removes administrative burdens, improves LA‚Äôs business prospects, creates more job growth, raises LA‚Äôs national business rankings
Eliminating personal income taxes puts more money in pockets of LA families, makes LA more attractive 2 companies who want 2 create jobs
We should eliminate all personal, corporate income taxes in revenue neutral way &amp; keep sales tax low &amp; flat http://t.co/m54cxQoC

2 oppose school choice is 2 oppose equal opportunity for poor and disadvantaged kids in America.
2 oppose school choice is 2 put the wishes of the adults who control the status quo ahead of the needs of children.
2 oppose school choice is 2 choose an old antiquated centralized approach that is not working &amp; has no relevance to the modern digital age
Equal opportunity in education should not be a conservative position, or a liberal position, it‚Äôs an American position.
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs taxpayers‚Äô money. It‚Äôs money dedicated to educating Louisiana‚Äôs students.
Historically, K-12 education spending is considered an entitlement to school districts.  They think it‚Äôs ‚Äútheir‚Äù money.
Teachers unions spending millions of $ every year to keep kids trapped in failing schools ‚Äì shameful.
And, unless you are fortunate enough to live in New Orleans, or Milwaukee, or Cleveland, you have no options, no recourse.
If you are a low income parent residing in an urban area in America, it is more likely than not your child attends a failing school.
Yes, we are the land of the free and the home of the brave, but America does not provide equal opportunity in education.
I‚Äôm speaking @BrookingsInst today on education reform. Register to watch online here: http://t.co/CDPGdGc3 #ChoiceIndex #EDreform
No surprise these ideas offend the tax &amp; spend crowd in D.C.  They‚Äôre common sense.
Washington has a spending problem &amp; is incapable of fiscal restraint.  That‚Äôs why we need structural reforms.
More Krauthammer: as a % of GDP, ‚Äúthe real marker of national solvency,‚Äù public debt doubled from 45% to 70% http://t.co/iX9ZZhvs
Another really ignorant guy-Charles Krauthammer-observed recently, public debt has increased by 83% under Pres. Obama http://t.co/iX9ZZhvs
The American people, those slow-witted rubes, who just don‚Äôt understand the liberal utopia of ever growing government.
Their opposition to a balanced budget amendment, term limits, and spending caps reveals their disdain for the American people.
I really enjoy being called ‚Äúdumb‚Äù and ‚Äúignorant‚Äù by the liberal elite and their media water carriers. http://t.co/u8idkBdU

Term limits.  We need them. And forbid congressmen from lobbying for 5 years. http://t.co/HsJWUkTw
A super majority to increase taxes‚Ä¶force them to stop growing government. http://t.co/HsJWUkTw
A cap on discretionary &amp; mandatory federal spending. Tie it to GDP &amp; require a super majority vote to override. http://t.co/HsJWUkTw
A federal balanced budget amendment. States do it. Small businesses do it.  Families to it.  It‚Äôs common sense. http://t.co/HsJWUkTw

Couldn‚Äôt agree more with @WSJ editorial:  http://t.co/xlK4A4l7  Unacceptable that perverse egalitarianism holding students back.
All along, we expected this to be decided by the Louisiana Supreme Court.
This ruling changes nothing for the students currently in the program.
we will appeal today‚Äôs decision, and I‚Äôm confident we will prevail.
On behalf of the citizens that cast their votes for reform, the parents who want more choices, and the kids who deserve a chance‚Ä¶
The opinion sadly ignores the rights of families who do not have the means necessary to escape failing schools.
That opportunity is a chance that every child deserves and we will continue the fight to give it to them.
Today‚Äôs ruling is wrong headed &amp; a travesty 4 parents who want their children to have an equal opportunity at receiving a great education
Now more than ever, we need to put students first. http://t.co/R6T5pNOz

Governor Romney is up to the challenge.  It‚Äôs time for a change.
The truth is that President Obama is really good at getting the job; he‚Äôs just not any good at doing the job.
The simple fact is that our President is a great campaigner and a great marketer‚Ä¶of himself.
FORWARD‚Ä¶UPWARD‚Ä¶SIDEWAYS ‚Ä¶ DIAGONAL‚Ä¶ CIRCULAR‚Ä¶all of these would be better than REALITY for this President.
The President will do anything to get us to not focus on reality.  In that sense, FORWARD is genius, it‚Äôs tremendous marketing.
FORWARD to borrowing more money from China?  FORWARD to more people needing food stamps?  FORWARD to more apologizing for America?
FORWARD to more increases in health care premiums?  FORWARD to creating more entitlement programs?  FORWARD to more foreclosures?
FORWARD to bigger deficits?  FORWARD To more government spending?  FORWARD to more Medicare cuts?
FORWARD to more of the same?  FORWARD To European socialism?  FORWARD to even more debt?
There is no better symbol of the futility and shallowness of President Obama‚Äôs campaign than his own slogan. FORWARD TO WHAT?

That statement, the 1st first statement by this Administration was pathetic &amp; reveals a lack of judgment. Very troubling.
Both the President and Gov. Romney were right in condemning the shameful statement released by our US embassy in Egypt.
Make no mistake, attacking our embassies and killing a US Ambassador &amp; other personnel is an attack on America, an attack on all of us.
Both the President and Gov. Romney were right in condemning these outrageous attacks on our citizens and our embassies.

Officials in MS are beginning to breach the dam to relieve pressure, but folks should take every precaution and prepare for the worst.
Especially if your home flooded during the 1983 or 1990 floods.
If people need help, we have resources on the ground, but we encourage folks to self evacuate before the river crests.
Tangipahoa update‚Ä¶the worst thing you can do is wait.  If you‚Äôve been asked to evacuate, you should evacuate.
Asking folks to be cautious and pay attention to local advisories on water safety and safe generator use.
Hopeful restoration of power can start tonight - when it‚Äôs safe for operators ‚Äì in the areas hit first by Isaac.
There are 656,000 people out of power.  I‚Äôve asked PSC to give regular updates.
DOA reports state has spent approximately $14 million thus far responding to the storm. Parishes have report spending more than $9 million.
22 hospitals are on generator power.  All hospitals have adequate fuel.
21 nursing home sheltered in place.  18 have HVAC capability, 1 evacuated; other three have other cooling solutions.
As of this morning, there were an estimated 4,130 people in shelters across the state.
We currently have enough MREs on hand for two days and we are working to push more through the pipeline.
LANG repositioning aircraft to Lake Charles to pre-stage for Search and Rescue operations
In Orleans, LANG has a roving patrol at the Super Dome, Security Team for six shelters, and 615 Guardsmen staged for search &amp; rescue.

In St. John, they have shut down part of the water system. We will be working with them to provide water buffalos today.
Riverbend nursing home on the West Bank is being evacuated ‚Äì 112 total residents.  LANG helping evacuate to YMCA &amp; sister facility.
We are still pushing the federal government to declare a full declaration.
Today we are requesting that the federal government add the other 30 parishes ‚Äì which will cover all 64 parishes.
Yesterday, 19 parishes were added to the federal disaster declaration for just federal direct assistance.
Parish President doing mandatory evac of the W. Bank South of Belle Chasse where waters are rising.  Estimated 3k people.

In Plaquemines Parish on the East Bank, water is overtopping at Braithwaite. This was mandatory evac location by noon Monday.
56 parishes have now declared a state of emergency.
We will see tropical storm force winds for 24-36 hours

The storm was almost stationary overnight.
This is a very slow moving storm. There will be sustained periods of heavy wind and heavy rain.

Yesterday LA National Guard delivered a 100-kw generator to St. Margaret Nursing Home in New Orleans.
National Guard has asked for Title 32 authorization and we‚Äôve not yet heard back from feds.
FEMA has the request, but they have not yet acted on it.
We think it‚Äôs important to be aggressive and do everything we can to protect our people and our property.
We have learned from past experiences that you cannot wait and you have to push the federal bureaucracy.
We sent a letter yesterday to the President requesting a full declaration.
However, the limited declaration does not provide for reimbursement of expenses that the state is taking to prepare for the storm.
Yesterday the President granted a limited disaster declaration for the state that provides for direct federal assistance.

There are currently 44 coaches at Zephyr field and there will be 322 commercial buses by the end of the day.
There are 921 Security and Command and control vehicles available, 503 high water vehicles, 74 boats, and 40 aircraft.
We have activated 4,126 Louisiana National Guard Soldiers and Airmen to support the storm response.
There is a state trooper liaison in every parish EOC that is under a hurricane warning.
There have been 1100 inmates moved out of New Orleans and 224 out of St. Bernard. By the end of today, they will have moved over 2000.
The Department of Corrections is assisting in a number of inmate evacuations from Southeastern and coastal Louisiana
All five LDVA Veterans homes have fully stocked emergency kits on-hand including 90-day supply of standard medications.
If you need a place to go, we have state operated facilities, parish facilities, and red cross facilities available.
We‚Äôre not seeing huge demand for shelters at this time, but we expect many medical needs slots to be filled today.
At least 10 parishes have in-parish shelters available and we encourage folks to contact local Emergency Operations Centers.

Today is the day to get out of harms way.
Other parishes will be calling for evacuations South of the Intercoastal and in low-lying areas.
Mandatory evacuations: the entire Parish of St. Charles, low-lying areas in St. John, &amp; starting at 5pm ‚Äì low-lying areas of Tangipahoa.
Mandatory evacuations: south of the floodgates in Lafourche Parish, on the East Bank in Plaquemines Parish.
the following parishes have issued mandatory evacuations: Jefferson Parish on Grand Isle, in Lafitte and other low lying areas.
The national weather service has a low level of confidence on the direction of the storm, anyone within the cone should be prepared.
There could be inland parishes that experience strong winds and a lot of rain.  Please stay tuned to advisories &amp; alerts.
The slow moving nature of this storm means that there may be many parts of our state inundated with heavy winds &amp; rain for many hours.
Forecast currently shows that the storm will make landfall as a strong Category 1 hurricane.
One of the things I want to make clear is that every storm is unique.  There are now 20 parishes under a hurricane warning.
This storm, like every other storm is non-partisan.  This is a time when we must all come together.
Party conventions are interesting but there‚Äôs no time for politics here in Louisiana.
First, I will not be speaking or attending the Republican convention in Florida.

This election is a choice between more govt spending and more jobs.  @MittRomney will repeal Obamacare and create jobs.
POTUS said Obamacare will bend cost curve down.  CMS says health care spending to increase 7% in '14
Obamacare cuts Medicare $500b, raises taxes $500b, and increases govt spending 1.7trillion.  America can't afford it.
Was on @meetthepress this morning to talk Obamacare.  Here's a quick clip: http://t.co/6tgSD2Xo
Shorter #SCOTUS - Govt can require proof of insurance, but not proof of citizenship.
Republicans must drive hard toward repeal, this is no time to go weak in the knees.
Americans oppose it because it will decrease the quality of care, raise taxes, cut Medicare, and break the bank. All of this is still true.
The American people did not want or approve of Obamacare then, and they do not now.
The Court should have protected our constitutional freedoms, but remember it was the President that forced this law on us.
Today‚Äôs decision is a blow to our freedoms.
Ironically, the Supreme Court has decided to be far more honest about Obamacare than Obama was.  They rightly have called it a tax.
